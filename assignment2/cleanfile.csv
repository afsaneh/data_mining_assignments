CRISTINA ZILKHA THE SOCIAL LOCOMOTIVE AND ONE-TIME CHANTEUSE HAD TAKEN ME TO SOME FASHIONY EVENT ON THE UPPER EAST SIDE AND WE WENT ON TO SWIFTY??S FOR A BITE. THE FRONT ROOM WAS FULL SO WE HEADED TO THE BACK THE ROOM WHERE I HAD HUNG SOME DRAWINGS NOT SO LONG BEFORE AND WERE SEATED NEXT TO DAVID PATRICK COLUMBIA THE POTENTATE OF THE ON-LINE NEW YORK SOCIAL DIARY WHO WAS WITH THE WRITER CHRISTOPHER MASON. WE CHATTED ABOUT THIS AND THAT NOTHING CONSEQUENTIAL. BOLD-FACE NAMES COULD BE SEEN HERE AND THERE??MICHAEL KORS THE DESIGNER WITH AERIN LAUDER??SO IT WAS JUST ANOTHER SWIFTY??S EVENING. EXCEPT IT WASN??T. NEXT DAY I LEARNED IT HAD BEEN THE LAST. FOR SIXTEEN YEARS SWIFTY??S BEEN A DOMINANT BO??TE FOR A WHOLE UPPER EAST SIDE SOCIAL WHIRL. BUT LAST WEDNESDAY AFTER THE LAST DINER HAD WALKED OUT ONTO LEXINGTON ITS DOORS HAD CLOSED FOR GOOD. SO IT??S NOT JUST DOWNTOWN BOHEMIA THAT??S IN A FINANCIAL SQUIRMISH??A WORD I BORROW FROM SARAH PALIN??IT??S MANHATTAN IN TOTO. SOME SOCIAL HISTORY. ROBERT CARAVAGGI AND STEPHEN ATTOE WHO PARTNERED AT SWIFTY??S AS MANAGER AND CHEF BOTH WORKED MANY YEARS AT MORTIMER??S A FEW BLOCKS UP LEX. THIS WAS THE TOTEMIC EATERY CREATED BY THAT SPLENDID GROWLER GLENN BERNBAUM. NOT ONLY HAD MORTIMER??S BEEN HOTTER THAN HOT BUT ALSO QUITE A MIX. NAMEDROP ONE. MORTIMER??S WAS WHERE I WAS TAKEN BY BRUCE WILLIS WHEN HE WAS STUDYING FOR HIS PART AS AN OBNOXIOUS TABLOID JOURNALIST IN BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES. NAMEDROP TWO. SOMETIME IN THE LATE 80S I WAS LUNCHING IN THE BACK AT A TABLE BY THE CORRIDOR THAT LEAD TO THE LOOS. THE ULTRA-CHIC TABLE WAS THE ROUND ONE AT THE FRONT AND THE GROUP OCCUPYING IT HAD INCLUDED JACKIE KENNEDY KNOWN ON ALL GOSSIP PAGES THE GOSSIP PAGES SHE DESPISED AS JACKIE O. WELL I HAVE TOLD THIS TALE BEFORE BUT HERE GOES AGAIN. SOME THOUGHT OR OTHER OCCURRED TO ME DURING THE MEAL SO I TOOK OUT A POCKETBOOK AND SCRIBBLED MYSELF A NOTE. WHEN DONE I SAT BACK AND SAW THAT JACKIE O WAS LOOKING AT ME. IT WAS NOT A FRIENDLY LOOK. WELL I KNEW THAT MRS. KENNEDY WAS AWARE THAT I WAS A BRITISH WRITER. ANOTHER BRIT HAD ONCE TOLD ME HAD FOUND HIMSELF SITTING ALONGSIDE HER ON A PLANE AND HE HAD TOLD HER THAT HE WAS A JOURNALIST. SHE HAD RESPONDED ICE SHEETING THAT WHENEVER SHE MET A BRIT SHE ??ALWAYS ASSUMED THEY WERE A JOURNALIST.? UNTIL PROVEN HUMAN PERHAPS. I SWIFTLY PUT MY BOOK AWAY RETURNED TO THE CONVERSATION AND THE MEAL. ANOTHER THOUGHT ZIGZAGGED TOWARDS COHERENCE. OUT CAME THE BLACK BOOK AND I WAS SCRIBBLING AWAY WHEN I BECAME AWARE OF A PRESENCE AT MY SHOULDER. MRS. KENNEDY WHO WAS ON HER WAY BATHROOM-WARDS WAS TAKING A TIME-OUT TO EYE MY SCRIBBLE. A FEW DAYS LATER ONE OF THE MANHATTAN TABLOIDS NOTED THAT JACKIE O HAD BEEN SPOTTED LUNCHING AT MORTIMER??S. I REALIZED THAT NOTHING IN THE WORLD WOULD CONVINCE HER THAT I HAD NOT BEEN THE SOURCE OF THIS SCURRILOUS LEAK. GLENN BERNBAUM DIED UNEXPECTEDLY IN SEPTEMBER 1989. MORTIMER??S WHICH HAD BEEN THE CRUCIAL CONNECTIVE ELEMENT IN THAT WHOLE WORLD WAS PFFT!. THERE WAS MUCH THRESHING AROUND LOOKING FOR A SUCCESSOR??THE NEW YORK TIMES CROWNED LA GOULUE EARLY THE FOLLOWING YEAR??BUT THEN ROBERT CARAVAGGI AND STEPHEN ATTOE STEPPED INTO THE BREACH AND SWIFTY??S OPENED ON OCTOBER 1 1999. AND HERE THERE??S SOCIAL HISTORY TOO. SWIFTY??S WAS NAMED FOR GLENN BERNBAUM??S PUG DOG WHICH WAS ITSELF NAMED FOR ??SWIFTY? LAZAR THE HOLLYWOOD AGENT WHO HAD BEEN NICKNAMED THUS BY ONE OF HIS CLIENTS HUMPHREY BOGART. AND IT WAS SWIFTY LAZAR WHO GAVE THE OH-SO-DESIRABLE OSCARS PARTY IN HOLLYWOOD A ROLE NOW ASSUMED BY VANITY FAIR. LAZAR HAD BEEN A FIXTURE AT MORTIMER??S AND AT SWIFTY??S ALSO. MOREOVER THE SPACE THAT SWIFTY??S OCCUPIED HAD FORMERLY BEEN OCCUPIED BY THE KIOSK THE SECOND VENTURE OF NELL CAMPBELL THE DIVA BEHIND NELL??S THE HOTTER-THAN-HOT CLUB ON WEST 14TH STREET OF THE LATER 80S. SWIFTY??S WAS A COMFIER PLACE THAN MORTIMER??S THOUGH SOFTER-HEARTED. THERE WAS NO SIBERIA THERE FOR FOLK WHO LOOKED AS IF THEY HAD STRAYED IN FROM THE WRONG POSTAL CODE NO MOUNT BERNBAUM IN THE BACKGROUND LIABLE TO INTERMITTENT ERUPTIONS. THEY PLAYED THE NICENESS CARD. ??YOU??RE SITTING THERE? CARAVAGGI SAID. ??YOU MAKE FRIENDS. YOU SUDDENLY FIND YOU ARE HAVING A WONDERFUL EVENING WITH THEM. THIS DOESN??T OFTEN HAPPEN IN NEW YORK.? SO WHAT HAPPENED? ??THE RENTS TRIPLED? CARAVAGGI SAID. ??AFTER SIXTEEN YEARS STEPHEN AND I JUST FELT THAT THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WERE NO LONGER RIGHT THAT IT??S TIME TO BE MOVING ON TO SOMETHING NEW.??Ÿ AND THE BEREFT CLIENTELE? WELL THEY DO HAVE PLACES TO GO. LIKE AMARANTH AND NELLO??S ON MADISON VIA QUADRONNO ON EAST 73RD AND PRIMOLA??S ON SECOND. THEY??RE SURVIVORS THESE UPPER EAST SIDERS. ,16855.0

WHEN SHE WASN??T AVAILABLE HE DECIDED TO CAST COMEDIAN LOUIE ANDERSON INSTEAD. ??I WAS DRIVING TO WORK IN 2014. I THINK IT WAS MAY? ANDERSON TELLS ME THE MORNING AFTER THE SHOW??S PREMIERE LAST THURSDAY. ??AND MY OLD AGENT CALLED AND SAYS ??LOUIS C.K. WANTS YOUR NUMBER?? AND I SAID ??CHARGE HIM $100000 FOR IT??? HE SAYS LAUGHING. ??THERE WASN??T ANY MORE INFORMATION THAN THAT? ANDERSON SAYS. ??AND I THINK IT WAS LIKE 10 MINUTES LATER LOUIS CALLED. AND HE SAID ??LOUIE? THIS IS LOUIS.??? TODAY??S MOST HIGHLY-RESPECTED STAND-UP COMEDIAN TOLD THE MAN WHO ONCE HELD THAT TITLE 30 YEARS AGO THAT HE WAS PUTTING TOGETHER A NEW SHOW WITH ZACH GALIFIANAKIS AND THEY HAD A PART FOR HIM. ??HE GOES ??WE WANT YOU TO PLAY ZACH??S MOM??? ANDERSON REMEMBERS. WITHOUT HESITATION HE REPLIED ??YEAH! I??LL DO IT!? GALIFIANAKIS WHO WAS IN THE ROOM WITH LOUIS C.K. AT THE TIME TOLD THE STORY FROM HIS PERSPECTIVE ON A RECENT EPISODE OF MARC MARON??S WTF PODCAST. WHEN GALIFIANAKIS WAS THINKING ABOUT THE CHARACTER OF HIS MOTHER ON THE SHOW HE COULDN??T GET ANDERSON??S DISTINCTIVE VOICE OUT OF HIS HEAD. SO LOUIS C.K. SUGGESTED THEY JUST GIVE ANDERSON A CALL AND SEE IF HE WAS INTERESTED. REPEATING ANDERSON??S VERSION OF THE PHONE CALL NEARLY VERBATIM GALIFIANAKIS CONFIRMED ??THAT??S EXACTLY HOW IT WENT DOWN.? ??HE STEALS THE SHOW? GALIFIANAKIS ADDED OF ANDERSON. ??HE IS SO FUNNY TO ME.? ??WELL LOUIS C.K.

AND ZACH GALIFIANAKIS ARE SPENDING TIME TRYING TO FIND YOU??? HE SAYS TRAILING OFF AS HE PIVOTS TO A JOKE. ??I KNOW I DIDN??T OWE THEM ANY MONEY I KNOW I DIDN??T STEAL ANY OF THEIR JOKES.? ANDERSON HAD BEEN IMITATING HIS OWN MOTHER IN HIS STAND-UP ACT FOR MORE THAN 30 YEARS SO THE IDEA OF PLAYING A WOMAN ONSCREEN DIDN??T SCARE HIM. PLUS IT MEANT SOME MUCH-NEEDED WORK. AT 62 ANDERSON WAS IN DANGER OF BEING BEST-REMEMBERED BY YOUNGER VIEWERS FOR HIS PARTICIPATION IN 2013??S EMBARRASSING ABC GAME SHOW SPLASH IN WHICH HE AND OTHER PSEUDO-CELEBRITIES COMICALLY JUMPED INTO A LARGE POOL FROM A HIGH-DIVE BOARD. ??THEY WERE OFFERING ME A JOB? HE SAYS OF THE BASKETS GIG. ??THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN HOLLYWOOD IS YOU JUST WANT PEOPLE TO THINK OF YOU ENOUGH TO THINK THERE IS STILL GAS IN THE TANK.? ANDERSON WHO CONSIDERS HIMSELF AN ??INSECURE STAND-UP COMEDIAN? AT HEART MADE HIS TELEVISION DEBUT ON THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JOHNNY CARSON IN 1984 AND QUICKLY EXPLODED INTO THE STAND-UP BOOM OF THAT DECADE TAPING HIS OWN SPECIALS AND TOURING WITH FRIEND ROSEANNE BARR. PERHAPS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL TV PROJECT OF HIS CAREER WAS ALSO HIS MOST PERSONAL. LIFE WITH LOUIE AN AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL ANIMATED SERIES HE CREATED RAN FOR THREE YEARS ON FOX AND WON TWO EMMY AWARDS. ANDERSON THINKS HIS ROLE IN BASKETS IS THE ??BEST THING? HE??S DONE SINCE. REVIEWS FOR BASKETS SO FAR HAVE BEEN SOLIDLY MIXED. THE DAILY BEAST??S OWN KEVIN FALLON WROTE ??THIS IS A SHOW I HATED. AND THAT I LOVED. THAT I THOUGHT WAS STUPID AND THAT I ADMIRED. THAT WAS SO EXTREMELY NOT FUNNY. AND THEREFORE MIGHT ACTUALLY BE ONE OF THE GREATEST COMEDIES OF THE YEAR.? WHILE THE TONE OF THE SHOW SEEMS TO BE CONFOUNDING CRITICS ANDERSON??S PERFORMANCE HAS RECEIVED NEAR-UNIVERSAL PRAISE. THE NEW YORK TIMES??S JAMES PONIEWOZIK CALLED HIS PORTRAYAL ??STRIKING? THE HOLLYWOOD REPORTER??S TIM GOODMAN CALLED IT ??BRILLIANT? AND VARIETY??S MAUREEN RYAN WROTE THAT ??IT??S ALMOST WORTH WATCHING BASKETS JUST TO SEE ANDERSON PLAY ONE OF THE MOST INSTANTLY AMUSING AND SYMPATHETIC CHARACTERS ON TV.? IN THE ERA OF JEFFREY TAMBOR??S REMARKABLE EMBODIMENT OF MAURA PFEFFERMAN ON TRANSPARENT CASTING A COMIC LIKE ANDERSON IN WHAT WOULD TRADITIONALLY BE A WOMAN??S ROLE COULD BE SEEN AS A CRASS STUNT. BUT IT SIMPLY NEVER FEELS THAT WAY. NOTING THAT HE HAS MOSTLY AVOIDED READING ANY OF HIS POSITIVE NOTICES ANDERSON JOKES ??MY HEAD IS ALREADY SO BIG.? LESS THAN 24 HOURS AFTER THE SERIES PREMIERE HE SAYS ??I DON??T MEAN TO BE BOASTING BUT I HAVE HAD HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE CONTACT ME. I HAVE HAD MY FAMILY RESPOND WHICH IS REALLY GREAT. MY NEPHEW CALLED ME BECAUSE I LOOK JUST LIKE ONE OF MY SISTERS WHO HAS PASSED AWAY. AND HE WAS CRYING. SO IT WAS A LITTLE EMOTIONAL FOR HIM. AND HE??S SENDING ME MY SISTER??S LUCKY RING FOR ME TO WEAR ON THE NEXT SEASON??SHOULD THERE BE ONE. I JUST THOUGHT THAT WAS SO SWEET.? WATCH THIS EXCLUSIVE CLIP OF ANDERSON AS CHRISTINE BASKETS FROM EPISODE TWO AIRING TONIGHT THURSDAY JANUARY 28 BELOW. ANDERSON SAYS HE CHOSE TO BASE HIS PORTRAYAL OF CHRISTINE BASKETS A CHURCH-GOING COSTCO SHOPPER FROM BAKERSFIELD CALIFORNIA WHO HAS CATS NAMED AFTER RONALD REAGAN AND TIP O??NEILL ON BOTH HIS MOTHER AND HIS FIVE SISTERS WHO WERE A MAJOR PRESENCE IN HIS MIDWESTERN UPBRINGING. ??PEOPLE ARE VERY NICE IN THE MIDWEST BUT THEY??RE VERY PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE? HE SAYS. ??I??M NOT AS NICE IN THE CHARACTER AS MY MOM WAS AS A PERSON.? ??IT REALLY IS AN EXTENSION OF MY MOM? ANDERSON SAYS ADDING THAT HE ALWAYS AIMS TO MAKE HIS PERFORMANCE ??AS REAL AS POSSIBLE? WITHOUT ??AFFECTING OR CARTOONING IT UP.? HE SAYS HE ??FELT LIKE IT WAS DIVINE INTERVENTION? WHEN HE GOT THE CALL TO BE ON THE SHOW THAT ??SOMEHOW MY MOM FROM THE GREAT BEYOND WAS FINALLY GETTING HERSELF INTO SHOW BUSINESS WHERE SHE TRULY BELONGED IN THE FIRST PLACE.? ANDERSON??S MOTHER DID HAVE AT LEAST ONE FORAY INTO SHOW BUSINESS WHEN SHE APPEARED BY HIS SIDE IN AN EPISODE OF HOLLYWOOD SQUARES. ??I WAS THRILLED TO HAVE MY MOM ON THAT SHOW AND SHE LOVED IT SHE REVELED IN IT. AND SHE WAS FUNNY. SHE GOT LAUGHS? HE SAYS. ??AND THEN OF COURSE SHE MADE ME MAD 10 MINUTES LATER BUT THAT??S HOW MOMS ARE.? HE ALSO GOT THE CHANCE TO TAKE HIS MOTHER TO THE WHITE HOUSE WHEN HE PERFORMED FOR PRESIDENT REAGAN BACK IN THE ??80S BUT UNLIKE THE CHRISTINE CHARACTER ON BASKETS ANDERSON??S MOTHER WAS A LIFELONG DEMOCRAT. UPON LEAVING THE WHITE HOUSE HIS MOM PROMPTLY MADE A JOKE ABOUT WANTING A CHANCE TO ??FATTEN THAT NANCY UP.? WHEN ANDERSON WENT IN FOR HIS FIRST COSTUME FITTING AN EXPERIENCE HE SAYS HE FOUND ??SO UPSETTING AS A FAT PERSON? HE TRIED TO PICK OUT THINGS HIS MOM WOULD WEAR. ??I DIDN??T ALLOW ANYONE TO CALL ME LOUIE? HE SAYS OF HIS TIME SHOOTING THE SERIES. ??I SAID YOU HAVE TO CALL ME CHRISTINE.? THE SAME WENT FOR HIS TRAILER WHICH HAD THE NAME ??CHRISTINE? ON THE DOOR. DESCRIBING THE SURREAL EXPERIENCE OF SITTING DOWN IN THE MAKEUP CHAIR WITH HIS WIG AND COSTUME ON ANDERSON SAYS ??I DIDN??T LOOK LIKE ME ANYMORE.? HE LOOKED LIKE HIS MOTHER. ??IT??S SO NICE WHEN YOU CAN FIND A POOL WITHIN YOURSELF THAT??S ENDLESS? HE SAYS. ??I MEAN IT??S HARD FOR ME TO EVEN BE LOUIE ANDERSON ANYMORE. I WANT TO BE CHRISTINE SHE??S MUCH MORE FUN.? EVEN IF THE SHOW DOESN??T GET PICKED UP FOR A SECOND SEASON ANDERSON SAYS ??I??M GOING TO BECOME HER I THINK.? HE PAUSES CONSIDERING WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN. ??WHY NOT?? ,15594.0
948,10140027.0,2016-01-21T05:01:00+00:00,THIS IS WHAT WE DIE FOR: CHILD SLAVES MADE YOUR PHONE BATTERY,??THERE IS LOTS OF DUST IT IS VERY EASY TO CATCH COLDS AND WE HURT ALL OVER.? THE STATEMENT DELIVERED BY A 15-YEAR-OLD IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO (DRC) MARKS THE FOUNDATION OF A NEW REPORT FROM AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL. RELEASED THIS WEEK IT REVEALS A WORKING SITUATION SO TERRIBLE FOR THOSE THAT MINE MINERALS USED IN SMARTPHONES THAT IT BORDERS ON SLAVERY. TITLED THIS IS WHAT WE DIE FOR THE REPORT TRACES THE COBALT FROM LITHIUM BATTERIES THAT APPLE SONY AND 14 OTHER COMPANIES USE IN THEIR DEVICES TO UNREGULATED MINES IN THE DRC. THE 88-PAGE ACCOUNT BUILDS ON EARLIER REPORTS THAT MINERS IN THIS REGION RISK ABUSE AND DEATH TO MAKE JUST $2/DAY MINING COBALT. BUT ON TOP OF HAZARDOUS UNETHICAL WORK CONDITIONS IT EXPOSES AN OVERLOOKED FACT ABOUT THE MINERS THEMSELVES: AT LEAST 40000 OF THEM ARE CHILDREN. IF TECH COMPANIES ARE MAKING BILLIONS CHURNING OUT BETTER AND FASTER SMARTPHONES THEY MAY BE DOING IT ON THE BACKS OF AFRICAN KIDS. *** TO CONDUCT THE REPORT AMNESTY??IN PARTNERSHIP WITH AFRICAN RESOURCES WATCH (AFREWATCH)??VISITED FIVE SEPARATE MINING SITES IN THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE DRC FROM APRIL-MAY 2015. THE COUNTRY WITH A POPULATION OF AT LEAST 67 MILLION IS ONE OF THE POOREST IN THE WORLD. IN 2014 THE WORLD BANK RANKED IT SECOND TO LAST ON THE HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDEX. BUT IF THERE IS ONE THING THAT??S PLENTIFUL IN THE DRC IT??S COBALT. EXPERTS ESTIMATE THAT MORE THAN HALF OF THE WORLD??S SUPPLY COMES FROM THAT ONE COUNTRY ALONE WITH 20 PERCENT OF IT FROM WHAT ARE CALLED ??ARTISANAL MINES.? FOR CONGOLESE WHO ARE ABLE TO TOLERATE THE WORK IT IS PLENTIFUL??HOWEVER IT SEEMS RARELY IF EVER A CHOICE. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE 100 MINERS THAT THE RESEARCHERS INTERVIEWED SAID IT WAS THE ONLY JOB AVAILABLE ONE SAID THEY HAD TO DO IN ORDER TO EAT. THOSE WHOSE CHILDREN WERE WORKING SAID THEY COULDN??T AFFORD TO SEND THEM TO SCHOOL. A HANDFUL THAT WAS ABLE TO SEND THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL HAD TO ASK THEIR CHILDREN TO WORK ON THE WEEKENDS. ARTISANAL MINES WHERE MOST WORK ARE SMALLER INDEPENDENT MINES WHERE AN INDUSTRIAL-SIZED OPERATION IS NOT AN OPTION. WITHOUT A LARGE CORPORATION BEHIND IT ARTISANAL MINES ARE SOMEWHAT OF A FREE-FALL. THEY ARE NOT A PART OF THE COUNTRY??S MINING CODE AND REGULATIONS MEANING THEY ARE OFTEN UNAUTHORIZED AND EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. AS A RESULT THE WORKERS ARE SUBJECTED TO DANGEROUS CONDITIONS THAT INCLUDE POOR VENTILATION LACK OF PROTECTIVE GEAR AND FREQUENT ACCIDENTS??MANY OF WHICH PROVE DEADLY. BUT IT??S NOT JUST ADULTS THAT ARE RISKING THEIR LIVES. OF THE ALMOST 100 MINE WORKERS THE ORGANIZATION INTERVIEWED 17 OF THEM WERE CHILDREN. WORKING IN HIGH TEMPERATURES RAIN AND STORMS AMNESTY FOUND KIDS AS YOUNG AS SEVEN CARRYING SACKS OF MINERAL ORE HEAVIER THAN THEMSELVES. MANY SUFFERED FROM BREATHING PROBLEMS OTHERS FROM SICKNESS AND DISEASE. AT LEAST HALF REPORTED BEING BEATEN FOR NOT WORKING FAST ENOUGH. NONE IT SEEMED HAD A WAY OUT. ONE FORMER WORKER LOIC REPORTED SEVERE BACK PAIN FROM THE GRUELING WORK HE DID BEGINNING AT AGE NINE. A 14-YEAR-OLD TOLD THE RESEARCHERS HE HARDLY LEFT THE TUNNEL HE WORKED IN HUNDREDS OF FEET BELOW THE GROUND. ??[I SPENT] 24 HOURS IN THE TUNNELS? HE TOLD THEM. ??I ARRIVED IN THE MORNING AND WOULD LEAVE THE FOLLOWING DAY.? ONE MORE AGED 15 SAID HE WORKED FOR FOOD. ??ALL THE MONEY I EARN IN THE MINES I SPEND ON FOOD? HE SAID. ??BECAUSE AT HOME WE DON??T EAT.? AMONG THE POTENTIAL LONG-TERM EFFECTS THE CHILDREN CAN SUFFER FROM INCLUDE JOINT AND BONE DEFORMITIES RESPIRATORY ISSUES AND MUSCULOSKELETAL INJURIES. MOST COMPLAINED OF EXCRUCIATING BACK AND HIP PAIN OTHERS OF CHRONIC ILLNESS. BUT BEYOND PHYSICAL RISKS ARE LESS VISIBLE DANGERS. CHRONIC EXPOSURE TO COBALT CAN BE FATAL RESULTING IN A CONDITION CALLED ??HARD METAL LUNG DISEASE.? DESPITE THE PREVALENCE OF STUDIES CONFIRMING THIS AMNESTY FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AT THE MINES??NO GLOVES MASKS OR EVEN WORK CLOTHES. THE WORKERS HAD NEVER BEEN PROVIDED SAFETY EQUIPMENT NOR GIVEN DIRECTIONS ON WHAT TO DO IN A CRISIS. WITHOUT ANY SORT OF ARMOR AGAINST THE HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS DEATH IS COMMON. WHILE AMNESTY COULD NOT FIND AN OFFICIAL DEATH TOLL AN INDEPENDENT RADIO STATION IN THE DRC REPORTS AT LEAST FIVE TO SIX ACCIDENTS A MONTH??SOME OF WHICH KILL DOZENS AT A TIME. ACCORDING TO THEIR REPORTS 15 MINERS DIED IN A FIRE NEAR KASULO ON DECEMBER 26 2014 ON SEPTEMBER 13 2015 14 MORE WERE KILLED AFTER A TUNNEL COLLAPSED IN MABAYA. MANY MINERS TOLD THEM THAT THE NUMBERS ARE MUCH HIGHER BUT THAT MANY OF THE BODIES DUE TO THE POOR STRUCTURE OF THE TUNNELS ARE NEVER RECOVERED. ??THERE ARE MANY ACCIDENTS. MANY TUNNELS COLLAPSE? SAID 32-YEAR-OLD ARTISANAL MINER EMMANUEL. ??THE BODIES ARE STILL THERE.? *** AFTER WITNESSING THE CONDITIONS AT THE MINES AMNESTY AND AFREWATCH FOLLOWED THE ROUTE OF THE COBALT WHICH BROUGHT THEM TO A LARGE CORPORATION CALLED CONGO DONGFANG MINING INTERNATIONAL (CDM). CDM IS A SUBSIDIARY OF THE CHINA-BASED COMPANY HUAYOU COBALT WHICH SUPPLIES BATTERIES TO THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS TECH COMPANIES??INCLUDING APPLE SONY SAMSUNG AND DELL. THE RESEARCHERS REACHED OUT TO ALL 16 COMPANIES CONNECTED WITH HUAYOU COBALT AND GOT A VARIETY OF REPLIES. THE REPORT SAYS JUST ONE OF THE 16 ??ADMITTED THE CONNECTION? WHILE FOUR OTHERS SAID THEY WERE ??UNABLE TO SAY.? FIVE DENIED SOURCING FROM HUAYOU (DESPITE DOCUMENTS PROVING OTHERWISE) AND SIX SAID THEY WERE ??LAUNCHING INVESTIGATIONS.? APPLE WHO HAS BEEN CRITICIZED FOR LABOR PRACTICES IN THE PAST SAID IT WAS ??CURRENTLY EVALUATING DOZENS OF DIFFERENT MATERIALS INCLUDING COBALT IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY LABOR AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS AS WELL AS OPPORTUNITIES FOR APPLE TO BRING ABOUT EFFECTIVE SCALABLE AND SUSTAINABLE CHANGE.? MICROSOFT SAID IT WAS WORKING WITH AN ORGANIZATION THAT IS ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE. THE AUTHORS OF THE STUDY AREN??T SATISFIED WITH THE RESPONSES. MARK DUMMETT BUSINESS AND HUMAN RIGHTS RESEARCHER AT AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL POINTS OUT THE UNSETTLING JUXTAPOSITION. ??THE GLAMOROUS SHOP DISPLAYS AND MARKETING OF STATE OF THE ART TECHNOLOGIES ARE A STARK CONTRAST TO THE CHILDREN CARRYING BAGS OF ROCKS AND MINERS IN NARROW MANMADE TUNNELS RISKING PERMANENT LUNG DAMAGE? HE SAYS. WHILE HE DOESN??T ACCUSE THE COMPANIES OF IGNORING THESE FACTS OUTRIGHT HE DOES CONSIDER IT THEIR JOB TO MAKE SURE THE CHILDREN ARE REMOVED FROM THE MINES AND THE OTHER WORKING CONDITIONS FOR EVERYONE ELSE ARE IMPROVED. ??MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ENJOY THE BENEFITS OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES BUT RARELY ASK HOW THEY ARE MADE? HE SAYS. ??IT IS HIGH TIME THE BIG BRANDS TOOK SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MINING OF THE RAW MATERIALS THAT MAKE THEIR LUCRATIVE PRODUCTS.? IN A VIDEO ABOUT THE WORKING CONDITIONS PUBLISHED ON MONDAY DUMMETT CRITICIZES SONY SAMSUNG MICROSOFT AND VOLKSWAGEN (WHO ALLEGEDLY USE THE BATTERIES FOR ITS SMART CARS) FOR IMPLYING (OR IN SAMSUNG??S CASE OUTRIGHT STATING) THAT IT??S ??IMPOSSIBLE? TO TRACE WHERE THE COBALT COMES FROM.

BACKED THE BUNDYS,"JERRY DELEMUS MAY BE FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE BUT HIS HEART IS IN OREGON WHERE THE OFFSPRING OF HIS BELOVED FORMER ASSOCIATE CLIVEN BUNDY ARE HOLDING A REFUGE ON FEDERAL LAND HOSTAGE. THE 61-YEAR-OLD WITH A WHITE CLOSE-CROPPED GOATEE OFTEN PICTURED IN VARIOUS FORMS OF MILITARISTIC CAMO GEAR WENT ON A 41-HOUR ROAD TRIP TO NEVADA IN 2014 TO SUPPORT THE EFFORTS OF CLIVEN BUNDY AND HIS RANCHERS IN THEIR STANDOFF WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. NOW OVER A YEAR LATER DELEMUS SERVES AS A CO-CHAIR FOR THE ??VETERANS FOR TRUMP? COALITION IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. WHILE OTHER GOP CANDIDATES HAVE EITHER REMAINED SILENT OR CHOSEN TO DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM THE ACTION IN OREGON TRUMP HAS THE MOST DIRECT CONNECTION TO ONE OF THE MOVEMENT??S BIGGEST SUPPORTERS WHO HEADS A KEY TRUMP COALITION IN A CRITICAL STATE. DELEMUS WHO DID NOT RESPOND TO A REQUEST FOR COMMENT FOR THIS ARTICLE HAS A HISTORY OF PROMOTING MILITIA ACTION. IN 2013 HE TRIED TO TURN THE ROCHESTER NEW HAMPSHIRE WING OF GLENN BECK??S 9-12 GROUP INTO A MILITIA AT THAT TIME TO FIGHT AGAINST THE POSSIBILITY OF ANOTHER FINANCIAL COLLAPSE. ??I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE ANOTHER FINANCIAL COLLAPSE COMING SOON AND IT WILL BE WORSE THAN THE ONE IN 2008? DELEMUS WARNED. ??THERE ARE STARK DIFFERENCES WE MUST REALIZE THAT WE HAVE NEARLY A 0% INTEREST RATE AND OUR DEBT IS NEARLY DOUBLE. NOT TO MENTION OUR CREDIT RATING HAS BEEN DROPPED. ON TOP OF THIS WE HAVE A GOVERNMENT THAT HAS NO RESPECT OR REGARD FOR THE RULE OF LAW AS PROVIDED IN OUR CONSTITUTION. IF WE DO NOT STAND AGAINST THIS INSANITY WE CAN BE SURE WE WILL FULLY SLIP INTO TYRANNY. WE ARE IN A SIMILAR POSITION OUR FOUNDING FATHERS FOUND THEMSELVES IN AND THEIR DECISION TO STAND WAS EQUALLY DIFFICULT.? DELEMUS IS PERHAPS BEST KNOWN THIS CAMPAIGN CYCLE FOR ARRANGING A NEW HAMPSHIRE TOWN HALL IN SEPTEMBER DURING WHICH TRUMP FAILED TO CORRECT A MAN IN THE AUDIENCE WHO CALLED PRESIDENT OBAMA A MUSLIM (SOMETHING WHICH NOW SEEMS MODEST COMPARED TO TRUMP??S RECENT STATEMENTS). NEW HAMPSHIRE STATE REPRESENTATIVE DAN ITSE NOW A LOCAL TOWN CHAIR FOR TRUMP INTRODUCED LEGISLATION TO ESTABLISH A PERMANENT STATE DEFENSE FORCE AFTER HEARING DELEMUS SPEAK BUT IT WAS DEEMED INEXPEDIENT AND DIED. HE THINKS THAT IT??S STILL NECESSARY. ??I AM STILL INTERESTED IN REQUIRING THE ORGANIZATION OF THE MILITIA IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL SENSE (RSA 111 STATE GUARD). ?ŸTHAT IS A MILITIA OF WHICH THE GOVERNOR IS THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF? HE TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. ??I HAVE MADE SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO REQUIRE ITS ORGANIZATION.?Ÿ FOR SEVERAL TERMS THE CLAIM WAS THAT IT WOULD COST TOO MUCH.? HE SAID HE DIDN??T KNOW WHAT TRUMP WOULD DO IF HE WERE PRESIDENT NOW. ??I HAVEN??T ASKED HIM? ITSE SAID. ??I AM SUPPORTING HIM BECAUSE HE IS UNRESTRAINED BY WHAT THE PRESS AND PUNDITS SAY ABOUT HIM AND HE DOESN??T NEED THE JOB.? ??MY ASSESSMENT OF HIM IS THAT HE SIMPLY RECOGNIZES THAT THIS IS NOT THE AMERICA HE GREW UP IN AND HE HAS THE RESOURCES TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT? HE ADDED. ONE OF THE REASONS WHY DELEMUS LIKES TRUMP SO MUCH IS THAT HE TOO ABHORS POLITICAL CORRECTNESS. IN JUNE LAST YEAR THE RADICAL WANNA-BE MILITIAMAN PLANNED ON SCHEDULING A ??DRAW MUHAMMED? EVENT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE SIMILAR TO THE ONE WHICH TURNED VIOLENT IN GARLAND TEXAS. \I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT TAKING A RISK\"" HE SAID AT THE TIME. \""IT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO DEFEND OUR WAY OF LIFE IN THIS COUNTRY OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS FOR EVERYBODY.? TRUMP MAY NOT HAVE BEEN A BIG FAN OF THIS PLAN AS HE HAS PREVIOUSLY CRITICIZED PAMELA GELLER THE ISLAMOPHOBIC WRITER BEHIND THE ORIGINAL TEXAS EVENT.IT IS UNCLEAR AT THIS STAGE IF DELEMUS WILL MAKE A JOURNEY OUT TO OREGON TO REKINDLE HIS ROLE AS ??COMMANDER OF CAMP LIBERTY? HIS SO-CALLED TITLE AS HE ENFORCED SECURITY AT THE BUNDY RANCH IN 2014. ??I HAVE NOT SPOKEN TO JERRY DELEMUS ABOUT THIS SITUATION AT ALL? DAN TAMBURELLO ANOTHER CO-CHAIR OF VETERANS FOR TRUMP AND A STATE REPRESENTATIVE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE TOLD THE DAILY BEAST.

BUT TAMBURELLO THINKS TRUMP IS THE BEST-EQUIPPED PERSON TO DEAL WITH IT. ??I HAVE NO DOUBTS A PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD SEEK A RATIONAL RESOLUTION TO THE SITUATION WHILE CAREFULLY FINDING AND DEALING WITH THE ROOT CAUSE? TAMBURELLO SAID. ??DONALD TRUMP IS THE WORLD'S GREATEST NEGOTIATOR HE WOULD BE FULLY CAPABLE OF BRINGING THINGS TO A JUST CONCLUSION CONSIDERING ALL PARTIES AND THE LAW.? HE ADDED THAT HE DOESN??T HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE BUNDYS LATEST ANTI-GOVERNMENTAL STAND. ??I HAVE NOT EXAMINED THE SITUATION IN OREGON IN DETAIL SO I DO NOT HAVE AN OPINION AT THIS TIME. ?ŸI DO BELIEVE LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS HAVE AN INHERENT RIGHT OF SELF DEFENSE AND I AM ALSO A FIRM BELIEVER IN THE SECOND AMENDMENT OF THE U.S. CONSTITUTION.? TRUMP??S CAMPAIGN HAS NOT RESPONDED TO A REQUEST FOR COMMENT ABOUT THE ISSUE AND MANY CANDIDATES ON BOTH THE LEFT AND RIGHT SIDE OF THE AISLE HAD LITTLE TO SAY ON SUNDAY WHEN ASKED BY THE DAILY BEAST. A SPOKESMAN FOR MIKE HUCKABEE??S CAMPAIGN SIMPLY RESPONDED ??WHAT HAPPENED?? WHEN ASKED AND BY THE END OF THE DAY NO ONE HAD A STATEMENT ON THE EVENTS WHICH HAD TRANSPIRED. ON MONDAY ONE OF THE FEW CANDIDATES TO DISCUSS THE ISSUE AT ALL WAS TED CRUZ WHO INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH HAS HIS OWN TIES TO JERRY DELEMUS AFTER CRUZ JOINED A SMALL GROUP OF LAWMAKERS WHO BRIEFLY DEFENDED ROGUE CATTLE RANCHER CLIVEN BUNDY. IN 2014 CRUZ SAID HE BACKED THE CORE REASONS BEHIND BUNDY??S FIGHT FOR FREEDOM CALLING IT AN ??UNFORTUNATE AND TRAGIC CULMINATION OF THE PATH THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS SET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT UPON.? \""THE DETAILS OF THE BUNDY MATTER MAY BE COMPLICATED\"" CRUZ SAID. \""BUT I THINK THE REASON THAT THIS ISSUE IS RESONATING??IT'S RESONATING IN NEVADA AND TEXAS AND RESONATING ACROSS THE COUNTRY??IS THAT FOR FIVE YEARS WE HAVE SEEN OUR LIBERTY UNDER ASSAULT.

CRUZ WRITES THE TWO SPENT HOURS TALKING THAT DAY AND BECAME SUCH GOOD FRIENDS THAT A FEW MONTHS LATER WHEN CRUZ LAUNCHED HIS SENATE CAMPAIGN LEE ASKED HOW HE COULD HELP HIM. ??SURE YOU COULD ENDORSE ME? CRUZ WROTE. WHEN LEE AGREED BECOMING THE FIRST SITTING SENATOR TO ENDORSE CRUZ AND THEN ASKED WHAT ELSE HE COULD DO CRUZ REPLIED HE COULD HELP REACH OUT TO OTHER CONSERVATIVES IN THE SENATE. LEE REPLIED ACCORDING TO CRUZ ??TED I WILL MOVE HEAVEN AND EARTH TO GET THEM TO BACK YOU.? BUT SIX YEARS LATER AFTER COUNTLESS HOURS ON THE SENATE FLOOR TOGETHER DOZENS OF CO-SPONSORED BILLS AND EVEN A JOINT VICTORY FUNDRAISING COMMITTEE LEE HAS YET TO BACK HIS FRIEND??S PRESIDENTIAL BID. THOSE CLOSE TO LEE ATTRIBUTE HIS SILENCE TO THE FACT THE UTAH SENATOR HAS RELATIONSHIPS WITH SENS. MARCO RUBIO AND RAND PAUL AND IS LEGITIMATELY TORN BETWEEN HIS FRIENDS. ??HE JUST FLAT OUT HASN??T MADE UP HIS MIND YET. IT??S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.

BUT WE??VE ALSO HAD DISAGREEMENTS WITH CRUZ ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE.? BUT WHILE CRUZ MAY BE THE CLOSEST TO LEE PERSONALLY HE??S ALSO THE ONE WHO GOT HIM IN THE MOST TROUBLE BACK HOME. IN HIS MEMOIR CRUZ SAID NO ONE STOOD BY HIM ??MORE COURAGEOUSLY OR INDISPENSABLY? DURING HIS 21-HOUR SPEECH THAN LEE. AS THE BUDDIES TOURED THE COUNTRY AHEAD OF THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN LEE??S APPROVAL IN UTAH PLUMMETED AND ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS IN THE STATE STARTED TO HAVE THEIR DOUBTS ABOUT WHETHER LEE WAS SOMEONE THEY WANTED REPRESENTING THEM IN WASHINGTON. IN OCTOBER 2013 LEE??S APPROVAL RATING IN THE STATE FELL TO JUST BELOW 40 PERCENT ACCORDING TO THE UTAH VOTER POLL AT BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY. A MAJORITY OF VOTERS IN THAT SAME POLL CALLED FOR LEE TO COMPROMISE IN ORDER TO AVOID A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN. LEE HAS SINCE BOUNCED BACK FROM THE EDGE??IN PART BECAUSE HE COURTED ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS IN UTAH TO BACK HIS RE-ELECTION??AND IS EXPECTED CRUISE (NO PUN INTENDED) TO VICTORY IN 2016. SPENCER STOKES LEE??S FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF SAID LEE??S TROUBLES IN UTAH WERE LONG GONE. ??I THINK PEOPLE HAVE BEGUN TO UNDERSTAND IN UTAH THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT MIKE IS TALKING ABOUT? HE SAID. AND LEE??S BRUSH WITH ELECTORAL DISASTER HASN??T KEPT HIM FROM CONTINUING HIS FRIENDSHIP WITH CRUZ. IN 2014?ŸTHE TWO BUDS STIRRED CONTROVERSY WHEN THEY POSED TOGETHER WITH A TIGER SKIN RUG.

OF COURSE THERE WERE PROBLEMS SUCH PROBLEMS??PRINCIPALLY THAT MR. CARSON QUITE RIGHTLY FANCIED A DO IN THE DRAWING ROOM OF THE ABBEY AND MRS. HUGHES FOR HER OWN UPSTANDING REASONS DID NOT WANT TO FEEL LIKE A SERVANT ON HER WEDDING DAY??EVEN THOUGH SHE WOULDN??T BE I STILL CAN??T REALLY GET THIS LABORED PLOT-POINT??WANTING THE RECEPTION INSTEAD IN THE CHILLY-LOOKING SCHOOLHOUSE. THERE WAS ALSO THE NOT INSIGNIFICANT MATTER OF MRS. HUGHES POSSESSING A WEDDING DRESS THAT LOOKED LIKE A TABLECLOTH. A WASHED OUT SHAPELESS TABLECLOTH. A TABLECLOTH BEYOND EVEN MRS. BATES?? SAVING. BUT THE REAL SURPRISE OF THIS EPISODE WAS CORA: NOT SINCE THAT MOMENT WHERE SHE SLIPPED ON THAT EVILLY-PLACED BAR OF SOAP AND MISCARRIED HAD LADY GRANTHAM HAD SO MUCH TO SAY AND DO. SHE WAS SET AGAINST DAME MAGGIE SMITH AS THE COUNTESS DOWAGER??ON ESPECIALLY BRILLIANT FORM AND WIELDING HER WALKING STICK AS IF IN A FENCING MATCH??ON THE MATTER OF THE LOCAL HOSPITAL REMAINING INDEPENDENT OR PART OF THE LOCAL HEALTH AUTHORITY. IN THIS MICRO-SAGA WHICH THE ACTORS LOOK AS BAFFLED TO BE PLAYING OUT FOR DRAMA AS WE ARE WATCHING IT ISOBEL CRAWLEY FREAKED OUT ON POOR DR. CLARKSON SLAGGING HIM OFF AS ??JUST ONE MORE LOCAL DOCTOR? AND LATER APOLOGIZED FOR SAYING SO. CORA WAS INEVITABLY EXHAUSTED BY THIS INCIVILITY AND COULD NOT THINK OF ANYTHING USEFUL TO SAY BUT TOOK HER LEAVE. SHE HAD A HEADACHE. THE ISSUE OF THE HOSPITAL HAS NOW STRETCHED TO FOUR INTERMINABLE WEEKS. THE STRESSED-OUT LADY CORA ALSO INTERRUPTED THE TRIUMVIRATE OF MRS. PATMORE MRS. BATES AND MRS. CARSON AS THEY TRIED ON FROCK COATS IN HER BEDROOM TO REPLACE MRS. CARSON??S HIDEOUS WEDDING DRESS. THIS WAS LADY MARY??S IDEA BUT SHE FAILED TO TELL HER MOTHER MEANING CORA HAD A MELTDOWN ABOUT FINDING SERVANTS IN HER BEDROOM JUST AFTER GETTING A HEADACHE BECAUSE OF LOCAL HOSPITAL-GHAZI. DIZZYING PLOTTING AM I RIGHT? THEN CORA APOLOGIZED FOR HAVING A MELTDOWN TO MRS. HUGHES AND GAVE HER THE COAT. AGREED THIS WAS NOT THE FIGHT FOR EWING OIL OR KIMBERLEY BLOWING UP MELROSE PLACE BUT IF YOU WEREN??T WEEPING A LITTLE OVER CORA??S APOLOGY THEN YOU HAVE NO HEART AND ARE HEREBY INSTRUCTED TO WATCH BEACHES UNTIL YOU ARE A SOBBING HEAP. LADY EDITH AS HER BRILLIANTLY SHADE-DEPLOYING SISTER MARY NOTED WENT TO LONDON ??IN A DUST OF DRAMA? TO TAKE CHARGE OF THE MAGAZINE SHE OWNS. SHE FIRED THE EDITOR (GOOD) AND THEN??AGAINST A 4AM DEADLINE AND HAVING NO EDITORIAL EXPERIENCE??PUT THE MAGAZINE TOGETHER. HER PROFESSIONAL SKILLS ON DISPLAY INCLUDED SCATTERING PICTURES OVER A DOUBLE-PAGE SPREAD ALONGSIDE MIMSY LITTLE CAPTIONS. EAT YOUR HEART OUT ANNA WINTOUR. WHO NEEDS EDITORIAL EXPERTISE? OF COURSE LADY EDITH WAS AIDED IN HER DEVIL WEARS PRADA JAPES BY A SUDDENLY LOVED-UP BERTIE PELHAM WHO IS SO LITHE IN HIS OVERCOAT I??D SAY WAS AN EARLY 1920S ADAPTOR TO HOT YOGA. HE??S ALL INTO HER AS A FEMINIST AND RUNNING HER OWN MAGAZINE AND WAS KEEN TO FEED HER SANDWICHES AND COFFEE AS SHE THREW HER OVERCOAT DOWN ON MINIONS?? DESKS AND TOLD US ALL ABOUT WHY THE COLOR BLUE WAS OF EARTH-SHATTERING IMPORTANCE. OK OK SHE DIDN??T. BUT I GIVE IT A WEEK. ANOTHER ODD PORTENT OF CHANGING TIMES CAME WITH A LETTER FROM BRANSON THE EX-REVOLUTIONARY CHAUFFEUR TURNED ESTABLISHMENT GENTLEMAN FROM BOSTON AMURRRICA. HE SAID HE WAS MISSING DOWNTON AND THAT HIS EYES WERE ??FILLED WITH TEARS? AS HE REMEMBERED THE ROMANTIC WALKS UNDER TREES THAT HE TOOK THERE WITH PIGEONS COOING IN THE TREES. ANY ENGLISHMAN KNOWS TO AVOID COOING PIGEONS BECAUSE THESE UGLY FLYING RATS CRAP EVERYWHERE. THE FORMERLY EVIL AND NOW JUST CAREWORN SERVANT BARROW WHO MR. CARSON CONTINUES TO BE A TOTAL BASTARD TO WENT OFF TO A BRITISH GREY GARDENS AND A SWEET-SEEMING ARISTOCRAT LOST IN THE MISTS OF A GRANDER ERA. WALKING THROUGH HIS ONCE-SPLENDID HOME NOW LITTERED WITH SCATTERED STAG-HEADS THREADBARE SOFAS AND CLOTHES DRYING NEXT TO THE FIRE HE RECALLED GLAMOROUS EVENING BALLS WITH LADIES AND THEIR TWINKLING JEWELS. BARROW A LITTLE FREAKED OUT BY THIS GENTLEMAN??S LIVING IN THE PAST SO RESOLUTELY??AND HIS BELIEF THAT THOSE GRAND TIMES WOULD RETURN AGAIN??TOOK HIS LEAVE. FAIR ENOUGH: THIS WAS JUST AFTER THE LOST-IN-TIME ARISTO HAD GROWLED ??I CAN??T RISK A REPUBLICAN IN THIS HOUSEHOLD WHEN ANYONE MIGHT CALL.? ONLY THE GOODLY BAXTER IS SHOWING ANY SYMPATHY TO BARROW OVER HIS AS YET-FUTILE PURSUING OF NEW SERVANT ANDY WHO DID SEEM A LITTLE WARMER TO HIS PURSUER THIS WEEK. BUT STILL: NOTHING AND BAXTER GENTLY ADVISED BARROW ??DON??T GO FISHING WHEN THEY??RE NOT GOING TO BITE.? MRS. CARSON HAD HER SAY TO THE WHOLE HOUSE ABOUT WANTING TO HAVE HER WEDDING DAY CELEBRATION IN THE COLDEST MOST MORALLY UNYIELDING VENUE OF THE SCHOOLHOUSE (WHERE SHE COULD HAVE A ??SOLID MEAL AT PROPER TABLES???YAWN SOMEONE SHOW THIS WOMAN THE GLORY OF A GOOD SALMON PINWHEEL). EVERYONE UNDERSTOOD MRS. HUGHES?? RIGID DISAVOWAL OF LUXURY AND SOFT FURNISHINGS EXCEPT US WHO WOULD FREAKING DIE TO HAVE OUR WEDDING RECEPTION IN DOWNTON??S RECEPTION ROOMS PREFERABLY WITH THE COUNTESS DOWAGER SWIVELING MENACINGLY ON HER WALKING STICK AND BEING VILE ABOUT EVERYBODY. LADY MARY FOR REASONS STILL COMPLETELY PUZZLING TO THIS VIEWER ACCUSED HER MOTHER OF BEING A SNOB. THIS FRETTING TOOK PLACE ALONGSIDE DENKER THE COUNTESS DOWAGER??S SNEAKY LADYSERVANT FIGURING OUT THAT SPRATT HER BUTLER WAS HIDING SOMETHING??NAMELY A NEPHEW ON THE RUN FROM THE LAW. WILL SHE SHOP HIM? WHILE LADY EDITH??S TEDIOUS VOYAGE OF PROTO-FEMINIST SELF-DISCOVERY ENDED WITH HER REFRAIN OF WANTING TO ??FIND A PURPOSE???HASN??T SHE FOUND ONE???THE REAL POWER DUO OF DOWNTON IS PRESENTLY LADY MARY AND MRS. BATES WHO SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME IN LADY M??S BOUDOIR PLOTTING TO RIGHT EVERY WRONG IN THE STORYLINE. AFTER HAVING HER LADY-BITS INSPECTED BY HARLEY STREET??S FINEST LAST WEEK ANNA BATES IS SUDDENLY PREGNANT BUT ISN??T GOING TO SAY ANYTHING TO MR. BATES UNTIL LADY MARY TAKES HER AGAIN TO LONDON TO HAVE THE SAFE CARRYING OF HER BABY CONFIRMED OFFICIALLY IN A FEW MONTHS?? TIME. THIS MEANS THERE IS DEFINITELY TIME FOR SOMETHING MISERABLE TO HAPPEN TO MR. AND MRS. BATES THAT COULD CONCEIVABLY END UP WITH ONE OF THEM IN JAIL FOR A MURDER THEY DIDN??T COMMIT. IT??S BEEN AN ODD WEEK AND A BIT WITHOUT THAT HANGING OVER THEIR HEADS. THE SAGA OF MRS. CARSON??S WEDDING OUTFIT SOLVED BY LADY GRANTHAM??S KIND DONATION OF HER HIDEOUS COAT-THING AND HER GENTLE AND SWEET APOLOGY FOR BEING A COW TOOK US TO A LOVELY AND BRIEF SET OF SCENES OF MR. CARSON AND MRS. HUGHES RETIRING FOR THE NIGHT BEFORE THEIR WEDDING AND BAXTER TRYING TO STITCH THE WEDDING COAT INTO SERVICEABLE SHAPE FOR MRS. HUGHES. THE WARMTH OF THE NEXT DAY EVEN MELTED MR. CARSON??S CHILLY MANNER TOWARDS BARROW TO LET HIM HAVE ONE OF HIS ROSE AND HEATHER BUTTONHOLES. HE AND MRS. CARSON EXCHANGED SIMPLE VOWS AND THEN IT WAS ON TO THE SPARSELY MORALLY UPSTANDINGLY DECORATED SCHOOLHOUSE WHERE THE COUNTESS DOWAGER CONTINUED TO DOLE OUT THE ZINGERS. SHE??D HAD AN ESPECIALLY VINEGARY EPISODE UP UNTIL HER FINAL OBSERVATION THAT ??A PEER IN NEED OF REFORM IS LIKE A TURKEY IN FAVOR OF CHRISTMAS? ABOUT LORD MERTON COMING ROUND TO CHANGING HOW THE LOCAL HOSPITAL WAS MANAGED. (PLEASE ENOUGH WITH THE LOCAL HOSPITAL??S MANAGEMENT.) MR. CARSON SAID MRS. HUGHES ENTRUSTING HER HAPPINESS TO HIM ??PASSES ALL UNDERSTANDING.? SIGH/WEEP. WILL SHE NOW BE KNOWN AS MRS. CARSON? I GUESS SO. AT WHICH POINT TA-DAH BRANSON REAPPEARED WITH LITTLE DAUGHTER SYBBIE FRESHLY RETURNED FROM BOSTON AMURRICA TO STAY FOR GOOD IF LORD GRANTHAM WOULD HAVE HIM. EVERYONE SAID THEY WOULD HAVE HIM HAPPILY AND SO WOULD WE. AND THEN IN THE EPISODE??S MOST CRAZILY-CHEESY MOMENT BRANSON HAD HIS OWN WIZARD OF OZ MOMENT RECITING WHAT HE HAD LEARNT ABOUT ??HOME?? IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY AS DOROTHY WOULD TELL AUNT EM A FEW YEARS LATER AFTER AWAKING FROM HER DREAM OF OZ THE WICKED WITCH THE TIN MAN ET AL. ??I HAD TO GO TO BOSTON TO FIGURE SOMETHING OUT??THAT DOWNTON WAS HOME AND YOU??RE MY FAMILY? HE SAID. ??I DIDN??T KNOW THAT BEFORE I LEFT AND I KNOW THAT NOW.? ALL BRANSON WAS MISSING WAS A PAIR OF RUBY SLIPPERS TO TAP TOGETHER??BUT HE??D REALIZED THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THE SAME WARM KNOWLEDGE US FANS BATHE IN EVERY SUNDAY NIGHT: THERE??S NO PLACE LIKE DOWNTON. ,15016.0

INSIDE VAMPIRE WEEKEND THE PITCHFORK-APPROVED INDIE BAND WAS PREPARING TO HEAD OUT FOR A SOUNDCHECK. SYMONE SANDERS (NO RELATION) THE CAMPAIGN??S PRESS SECRETARY SAID FRIDAY??S SHOW IN DES MOINES WOULD BE THE ??ACOUSTIC? PRECURSOR TO SATURDAY??S BLOWOUT CONCERT IN IOWA CITY WHERE THE GROUP WOULD ALSO PERFORM IN HONOR OF THE SENATOR. TRUMP AND SANDERS TWO OUTSIDER CANDIDATES WHO HAVE SUCCESSFULLY CHALLENGED THE RULES AND CUSTOMS OF THE REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC PARTIES RESPECTIVELY ARE GOING ABOUT THEIR INSURGENCIES QUITE DIFFERENTLY HERE ON THE GROUND IN THE HAWKEYE STATE. AND THE MOODS AT THEIR HQ??S IS JUST THE BEGINNING. HISTORICALLY DEMOCRATS TEND TO ASSEMBLE ROBUST FIELD OPERATIONS WITH HUNDREDS OF STAFFERS AND VOLUNTEERS MANNING PHONES AND KNOCKING ON DOORS WHILE REPUBLICANS RELY ON WHAT THE GUARDIAN DESCRIBED AS ??EXISTING NETWORKS THROUGH LOCAL PARTY ACTIVISTS AND AFFINITY GROUPS SUCH AS HOME SCHOOLERS? TO GET THEIR MESSAGE OUT. IN THIS RESPECT SANDERS IS A TRADITIONALIST - IN 2008 BARACK OBAMA HAD 37 OFFICES IN 34 COUNTIES IN IOWA. SANDERS HAS 26 ACROSS THE STATE????WHILE TRUMP??S OPERATION STANDS FIRMLY OUTSIDE THE BOX. HE RELIES ON HIS FAME TO PACK FANS INTO RALLIES ADVERTISED ON EVENTBRITE WHERE THEY MUST PROVIDE PERSONAL INFORMATION????THEIR EMAIL ADDRESS PHONE NUMBER ADDRESS AND AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION ??ARE YOU REGISTERED TO VOTE AS A REPUBLICAN??????IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A FREE TICKET. SOMETIMES THE TICKET-PURCHASER IS THEN CONTACTED AND ASKED TO VOLUNTEER FOR THE CAMPAIGN. SOMETIMES THEY??RE NOT. IN A RECENT MONMOUTH UNIVERSITY POLL OF IOWA REPUBLICANS 25% SAID THEY HAD BEEN CONTACTED BY TED CRUZ??S CAMPAIGN. ONLY 13% HAD BEEN CONTACTED BY TRUMP??S. I MET CHARLIE GRUSCHOW A TEA PARTY ACTIVIST WHO PREVIOUSLY SUPPORTED HERMAN CAIN AND NEWT GINGRICH IN LINE AT TRUMP??S RALLY THURSDAY NIGHT. HE WORE A TRUMP HAT AND PIN AND SAID HE??D BE CAUCUSING ON BEHALF OF TRUMP ON MONDAY BECAUSE HE??S THE ONLY REPUBLICAN WHO COULD BEAT CLINTON IN A GENERAL ELECTION. BUT LATER WHEN I ASKED HIS IMPRESSION OF TRUMP??S OPERATION HE SOUNDED LESS CONFIDENT. ??I WORKED ON OTHER CAMPAIGNS AND DURING THE PROCESS JUST BEFORE THE CAUCUS WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY PRECINCT IN THE STATE HAD SOMEONE TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF OUR CANDIDATE? HE SAID. ??I HAVEN??T SEEN TRUMP PUT A LOT OF MONEY INTO HIRING A BUNCH OF PEOPLE HERE IN THE STATE.

IT??S A VERY GOOD QUESTION.? TRUMP??S PLANS IN IOWA ARE A BLACK BOX????EVEN TO HIS DIEHARD POLITICALLY SAVVY SUPPORTERS LIKE GRUSCHOW????WHILE SANDERS??S PLANS AND EVEN HIS DOUBTS (THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORTED THIS WEEK THAT THE CAMPAIGN??S INTERNAL POLLING SHOWS HILLARY CLINTON WITH A SLIGHT EDGE) ARE OUT IN THE OPEN FOR ALL TO SCRUTINIZE. ??WE??VE GOT ALL THESE CANVASS PACKETS LINED UP? JEFF WEAVER SANDERS??

THE DECISION NOW RESTS WITH SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ASH CARTER WHO IS SAID TO BE WILLING TO CONSIDER OVERRULING AN EARLIER RECOMMENDATION BY THE ARMY THAT PETRAEUS NOT HAVE HIS RANK REDUCED. SUCH A DEMOTION COULD COST THE STORIED GENERAL HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS??AND DEAL AN ADDITIONAL BLOW TO HIS ONCE-PRISTINE REPUTATION. \THE SECRETARY IS CONSIDERING GOING IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION\"" FROM THE ARMY A DEFENSE OFFICIAL TOLD THE DAILY BEAST BECAUSE HE WANTS TO BE CONSISTENT IN HIS TREATMENT OF SENIOR OFFICERS WHO ENGAGE IN MISCONDUCT AND TO SEND A MESSAGE THAT EVEN MEN OF PETRAEUS?? FAME AND ESTEEMED REPUTATION ARE NOT IMMUNE TO PUNISHMENT. PENTAGON SPOKESPERSON PETER COOK TOLD THE DAILY BEAST THAT CARTER HAD REQUESTED MORE INFORMATION ON THE MATTER BEFORE REACHING A FINAL DECISION.?Ÿ \""THE DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY IS STILL IN THE PROCESS OF PROVIDING THE SECRETARY WITH INFORMATION RELEVANT TO FORMER?? SECRETARY MCHUGH'S RECOMMENDATION? COOK TOLD THE DAILY BEAST REFERRING TO EX-ARMY SECRETARY JOHN MCHUGH WHO HAD RECOMMENDED TAKING NO ACTION AGAINST PETRAEUS. ??ONCE THE SECRETARY?? HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONSIDER THIS INFORMATION HE WILL MAKE HIS DECISION ABOUT NEXT STEPS IF ANY IN THIS MATTER.\"" CARTER COULD ALSO RECOMMEND OTHER ACTIONS THAT DON??T RESULT IN PETRAEUS LOSING HIS FOURTH STAR. OR THE DEFENSE SECRETARY COULD SIMPLY ALLOW THE ARMY??S PREVIOUS RECOMMENDATIONS TO STAND. PETRAEUS ARGUABLY THE MOST WELL-KNOWN AND REVERED MILITARY OFFICER OF HIS GENERATION RETIRED FROM THE ARMY IN 2011 WITH THE RANK OF A FOUR-STAR GENERAL THE HIGHEST RANK AN ARMY OFFICER CAN ACHIEVE. IF CARTER DECIDES TO STRIP PETRAEUS OF HIS FOURTH STAR HE COULD BE DEMOTED TO THE LAST RANK AT WHICH HE ??SATISFACTORILY? SERVED ACCORDING TO MILITARY REGULATIONS. REDUCING PETRAEUS?? RANK MOST LIKELY TO LIEUTENANT GENERAL COULD MEAN HE??D HAVE TO PAY BACK THE DIFFERENCE IN PENSION PAYMENTS AND OTHER BENEFITS THAT HE RECEIVED AS A RETIRED FOUR-STAR GENERAL. THAT WOULD AMOUNT TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OVER HIS RETIREMENT. ACCORDING TO PENTAGON FIGURES A FOUR-STAR GENERAL WITH ROUGHLY THE SAME YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AS PETRAEUS WAS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE A YEARLY PENSION OF NEARLY $220000. A THREE-STAR OFFICER WOULD RECEIVE ABOUT $170000. PETRAEUS DIDN??T RESPOND TO A REQUEST FOR COMMENT. BUT THE FINANCIAL PAIN TO PETRAEUS ISN??T LIKELY TO BE SEVERE. HE HAS CONFIDED TO FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES THAT HE??S MAKING A HEFTY SUM FROM HIS JOB AT A PRIVATE EQUITY FIRM AND THROUGH SPEAKING FEES. THE DEMOTION IN RANK WOULD BE A BIGGER LASTING BLOW AND TAKE FROM PETRAEUS THE RARE ACHIEVEMENT HE??D SET HIS EYES ON MANY YEARS AGO. AT ANY GIVEN TIME THERE ARE ONLY 12 FOUR-STAR GENERALS IN THE ARMY THE LARGEST OF THE SERVICES. BY THE TIME HE WAS A COLONEL IN THE MID-1990S MANY THOUGHT PETRAEUS WAS DESTINED TO BE ONE OF THEM. THE U.S MILITARY HAS ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS DEMOTED GENERALS INCREASINGLY FOR IMPROPER PERSONAL CONTACT AND NOT FOR POOR BATTLEFIELD DECISIONS. BUT RARELY DOES IT DEMOTE FOUR-STAR GENERALS IN PART BECAUSE THERE ARE SO FEW OF THEM. IT??S ALSO MORE COMMON TO REDUCE THE RANK OF MORE JUNIOR OFFICERS THAN OF TOP GENERALS. IF PETRAEUS WERE DEMOTED IT WOULD MARK ANOTHER SPECTACULAR FALL. PETRAEUS STEPPED DOWN AS DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY IN 2012 AFTER HIS AFFAIR WITH PAULA BROADWELL A WRITER AND CURRENT ARMY RESERVIST WAS REVEALED. AT THE TIME PETRAEUS HAD BEEN FREQUENTLY MENTIONED AS A POSSIBLE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN 2016. PETRAEUS PLEADED GUILTY LAST YEAR TO GIVING BROADWELL EIGHT NOTEBOOKS THAT HE COMPILED WHILE SERVING AS COMMANDER OF U.S. FORCES IN AFGHANISTAN AND THAT HE KNEW CONTAINED CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. THE NOTEBOOKS HELD SOME OF THE MOST SENSITIVE KINDS OF MILITARY AND INTELLIGENCE SECRETS INCLUDING THE IDENTITIES OF COVERT OFFICERS INTELLIGENCE CAPABILITIES QUOTES FROM HIGH-LEVEL MEETINGS OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL AND NOTES ABOUT PETRAEUS?? DISCUSSIONS WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA. AFTER LEAVING AFGHANISTAN PETRAEUS BROUGHT THE BOOKS BACK TO HIS HOME IN VIRGINIA AND GAVE THEM TO BROADWELL JUST THREE DAYS BEFORE HE RETIRED FROM THE ARMY. SHE LATER RETURNED THEM. NO CLASSIFIED INFORMATION APPEARED IN HER BIOGRAPHY ALL IN: THE EDUCATION OF GENERAL DAVID PETRAEUS OFFICIALS HAVE SAID. PETRAEUS COULD HAVE FACED FELONY CHARGES INCLUDING FOR LYING TO FBI INVESTIGATORS BUT WAS ALLOWED TO PLEAD GUILTY LAST YEAR TO A MISDEMEANOR COUNT OF UNAUTHORIZED HANDLING CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. HE AVOIDED AND AVOID A PRISON SENTENCE AND RECEIVED TWO YEARS PROBATION AND A $100000 FINE. BUT THAT WAS NOT THE END OF THE MATTER. LAST YEAR THE FBI GAVE ARMY INVESTIGATORS INFORMATION THAT THE BUREAU HAD COME ACROSS AS IT WAS CLOSING UP ITS OWN INVESTIGATION OF PETRAEUS THE DEFENSE OFFICIAL AND ONE FORMER U.S. OFFICIAL TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. THE INFORMATION THE FBI BELIEVED MIGHT BE OF INTEREST TO THE ARMY THE DEFENSE OFFICIAL SAID. THE ARMY INVESTIGATED AND DECIDED \""THERE WAS NOTHING NEW HERE THAT SHOULD CHANGE HIS RETIREMENT? AND \""RECOMMENDED THAT THERE BE NO CHANGE? TO HIS FOUR-STAR RANK THE OFFICIAL SAID. LAST MONTH IT WENT TO THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR FINAL APPROVAL. ARMY PERSONNEL REGULATIONS SAY THAT AN OFFICER DOESN??T AUTOMATICALLY RETIRE WITH THE HIGHEST RANK HE OR SHE ACHIEVED WHILE IN UNIFORM. AND EVEN THOUGH PETRAEUS HAD ALREADY BEEN OFFICIALLY RETIRED THROUGH A PROCESS KNOWN AS GRADE DETERMINATION THE ARMY CAN RETROACTIVELY REOPEN HIS CASE AND CONSIDER WHETHER TO DEMOTE HIM ??[I]F SUBSTANTIAL NEW EVIDENCE DISCOVERED CONTEMPORANEOUSLY WITH OR WITHIN A SHORT TIME FOLLOWING SEPARATION COULD RESULT IN A LOWER GRADE DETERMINATION.? THE REGULATIONS ALSO STATE THAT IF ??AN OFFICER??S MISCONDUCT WHILE STILL ON ACTIVE DUTY IS DOCUMENTED? INCLUDING BY ??CONVICTION AFTER RETIREMENT? A NEW GRADE DETERMINATION MAY BE COMPLETED. PETRAEUS HADN??T YET RETIRED WHEN HE GAVE BROADWELL THE CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. THE ARMY RECEIVED THE INFORMATION FROM THE FBI THAT PROMPTED THIS NEW REVIEW MORE THAN FOUR YEARS AFTER PETRAEUS HAD RETIRED. THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT WAS ALSO RUNNING ITS OWN INVESTIGATION INTO PETRAEUS?? RELATIONSHIP WITH BROADWELL AND WHAT CLASSIFIED INFORMATION HE GAVE HER AT THE SAME TIME THE FBI AND FEDERAL PROSECUTORS WERE PURSUING THEIR CASE. THAT MAY EXPLAIN WHY THE ARMY DECIDED IT HAD SEEN NOTHING NEW IN THE INFORMATION IT RECEIVED LAST YEAR FROM THE FBI AND DECIDED NOT TO RECOMMEND A DEMOTION. BUT CARTER IS SAID TO BE CONCERNED THAT BECAUSE HE HAS RECOMMENDED OTHER GENERALS BE REDUCED IN RANK FOR ACTIONS NOT BECOMING AN OFFICER HE??LL BE SEEN AS INCONSISTENT IF HE DOESN'T DO THE SAME FOR PETRAEUS. THE DECISION IS AS MUCH ABOUT TIMING AND POLITICS AS IT IS PETRAEUS' OWN TRANSGRESSIONS.?Ÿ \""THIS IS ABOUT ASH CARTER NOT DAVID PETRAEUS\"" THE DEFENSE OFFICIAL SAID. LAST NOVEMBER CARTER REMOVED HIS SENIOR MILITARY AIDE LT. GEN. RON LEWIS FOR PERSONAL MISCONDUCT AND REFERRED THE MATTER TO THE PENTAGON??S INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR INVESTIGATION. LEWIS WAS DEMOTED A RANK TO A MAJOR GENERAL.?Ÿ LEWIS WAS A LONG-TIME AND INFLUENTIAL AIDE TO THE SECRETARY AND HIS REMOVAL AND PUNISHMENT SIGNALED CARTER??S COMMITMENT TO MAINTAINING UPSTANDING BEHAVIOR AMONG OF THE MILITARY??S GENERALS. THE EXACT NATURE OF LEWIS?? MISCONDUCT HAS NOT BEEN ANNOUNCED BUT MILITARY OFFICIALS HAVE SUGGESTED HE WAS INVOLVED IN AN IMPROPER PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP. WHILE FEW ARE FAMILIAR WITH PETRAEUS' POTENTIAL DEMOTION THOSE WHO ARE AWARE OF IT SAID THEY WERE SURPRISED THAT HE COULD BE PUNISHED YEARS YEARS AFTER THE SCANDAL WAS PRESUMABLY PUT BEHIND HIM AND AFTER PETRAEUS PLEADED GUILTY TO MISHANDLING CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. NO GENERAL IN RECENT HISTORY HAS BEEN DEMOTED YEARS AFTER SCANDAL SWIRLED AROUND HIM OR HER. THOSE WHO KNOW AND HAVE WORKED WITH PETRAEUS DESCRIBE HIM AS A MAN OF EXTRAORDINARY CAPABILITIES AND AMBITION. HE RECEIVED HIS FOURTH STAR IN 2007 AND THEN SERVED IN SEVERAL PRESTIGIOUS AND DEMANDING ASSIGNMENTS INCLUDING COMMANDER OF U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND THE COMMANDING GENERAL OF ALL GROUND FORCES IN IRAQ AND LATER AS COMMANDER OF GROUND FORCES IN AFGHANISTAN. PETRAEUS?? UNORTHODOX THINKING AND WILLINGNESS TO BUCK CONVENTIONAL STRATEGY WAS SEEN AS KEY TO THE U.S. VICTORY OVER INSURGENTS AND JIHADISTS IN IRAQ DURING THE SO-CALLED TROOP SURGE OF 2007 AND 2008. HIS REPUTATION WAS SO ESTEEMED THAT THERE WAS TALK OF GIVING HIM A FIFTH STAR--A LARGELY SYMBOLIC GESTURE THAT WAS HIGHLY UNLIKELY--OR RENAMING THE ROAD TO PETRAEUS?? ALMA MATER THE U.S. MILITARY ACADEMY AFTER HIM. SHOULD CARTER CHOOSE TO KNOCK PETRAEUS DOWN TO THE RANK OF A THREE-STAR GENERAL HE WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO APPEAL HIS CASE TO THE SECRETARY BUT CONGRESS DOESN??T HAVE TO BE INFORMED OF THE DECISION THE OFFICIAL SAID. THERE IS NO DEADLINE ON CARTER TO MAKE A DECISION. THE LAST COMMANDER TO LOSE RANK FOR PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT WAS BRIG. GEN. JANIS KARPINSKI WHO WAS DEMOTED TO COLONEL IN 2005 FOR THE ABU GHRAIB PRISON SCANDAL IN IRAQ. THE LAST FOUR-STAR GENERAL TO BE DEMOTED WAS GEN. WILLIAM WARD WHO RETIRED AS A THREE-STAR IN 2012 AMID ALLEGATIONS HE MISSPENT GOVERNMENT MONEY ON HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY. """,539315.0

CHICAGO-AREA COUNCILMAN ROBERT BATTLE WAS RE-INAUGURATED FROM JAIL WHERE HE IS AWAITING TRIAL FOR DRUG AND MURDER CHARGES LAST TUESDAY. AS REELECTION BIDS GO BATTLE??S WAS EASY. HE RAN UNCONTESTED FOR HIS COUNCIL SEAT IN EAST CHICAGO INDIANA. HE DID NOT VOTE ALTHOUGH HE COULD HAVE REQUESTED AN ABSENTEE BALLOT BE SENT TO HIS JAIL CELL. BUT BEATING THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM MIGHT PROVE TO BE HARDER THAN GETTING A BALLOT. FEDERAL AGENTS BEGAN INVESTIGATING BATTLE ON SUSPICION OF DRUG TRAFFICKING IN APRIL THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE REPORTS. THE U.S. DRUG ENFORCEMENT AGENCY OBTAINED A PHONE TAP WARRANT ALLOWING THEM TO TRACE BATTLE??S CELL PHONE VIA GPS. DURING A FIVE-DAY SEARCH FOR BATTLE DEA AGENTS RECORDED THE ELECTED OFFICIAL MAKING MULTIPLE TRIPS TO AND FROM A FLINT MICHIGAN ADDRESS WHERE A COCAINE DEALER WAS BELIEVED TO LIVE. A SEPTEMBER 23RD TRAFFIC STOP REVEALED 73.22 GRAMS OF MARIJUANA AND $100700 CASH IN BATTLE??S CAR WHILE A SEARCH OF THE FLINT HOME FOUND THREE STOLEN GUNS AND NINE OUNCES OF COCAINE.

A NUMBER OF GROUPS THAT ADVOCATE AGAINST ANONYMOUS DONATIONS IN POLITICS ARE THEMSELVES RESPONSIBLE FOR PUTTING MONEY INTO ELECTIONS THAT CANNOT BE TRACED OFTEN HIDDEN UNDER LAYERS OF OPAQUE NETWORKS. THE CENTER FOR PUBLIC INTEGRITY FOUND 21 GROUPS VOCAL ABOUT SO-CALLED DARK MONEY THAT PUT MONEY INTO POLITICS BUT DO NOT FULLY DISCLOSE THEIR DONORS. THE GROUPS EITHER GAVE TO BALLOT MEASURE CAMPAIGNS PAID FOR MESSAGES ABOUT CANDIDATES OR GAVE TO POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEES. ??IF YOU??RE GOING TO JUMP INTO THE ARENA OF COMBATING DARK MONEY IT??S FAR BETTER TO SHED LIGHT ON YOUR OWN MONEY? SAID NORM ORNSTEIN A DISCLOSURE PROPONENT AT THE AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE A RIGHT-LEANING THINK TANK. ??YOU NEED A PRETTY POWERFUL RATIONALE FOR NOT DOING THAT.? BUT MANY OF THE GROUPS IDENTIFIED BY THE CENTER FOR PUBLIC INTEGRITY SAID THAT THEY ALREADY EXCEED WHAT THE LAW REQUIRES BY DISCLOSING AT LEAST SOME OF THEIR DONORS. SOME RELIED ON AN ARGUMENT THAT OPPONENTS OF DISCLOSURE RAISE REGULARLY: THEIR DONORS COULD FACE HOSTILITY OR MISTREATMENT IF THE PUBLIC KNEW THE DONORS?? IDENTITIES. DARK MONEY GROUPS FIGHTING DARK MONEY IN MAINE GROUPS ADVOCATING FOR CLEAN ELECTIONS HELPED PASS A BALLOT MEASURE IN NOVEMBER THAT AMONG OTHER THINGS WILL REQUIRE ELECTION ADVERTISEMENTS TO DISPLAY THEIR TOP THREE FUNDERS. THE GROUPS EMPHASIZED THE STATE??S NEED FOR TRANSPARENCY IN THEIR APPEALS TO VOTERS. ??WHEN POLITICIANS RELY ON MONEY FROM WEALTHY SPECIAL INTERESTS THEY END UP IGNORING OUR PRIORITIES? ONE OF THE GROUPS MAINERS FOR ACCOUNTABLE ELECTIONS SAID IN TV ADS. ??WE NEED ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY TO KEEP POLITICIANS HONEST.? THE GROUP DID NOT SAY IN THE TV ADS WHO WERE THE TOP FUNDERS OF THE MESSAGES AS THE NEW LAW NOW REQUIRES OTHERS TO DO. AND THE COMMITTEES ADVOCATING FOR TRANSPARENCY ACCEPTED CONTRIBUTIONS THAT CANNOT BE FULLY TRACED ?? WHAT SOME OF THOSE ACTIVISTS TYPICALLY WOULD CALL ??DARK MONEY.? A MASSACHUSETTS-BASED CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM GROUP CALLED THE PIPER FUND GAVE $200000 TO ONE OF THE MAINE BALLOT MEASURE COMMITTEES ADVOCATING FOR THE CLEAN ELECTIONS INITIATIVE ACCORDING TO STATE RECORDS. BUT WHO EXACTLY MAY HAVE SUPPLIED THAT $200000 TO THE PIPER FUND IS SOMEWHAT OF A MYSTERY. THE GROUP LISTS A NUMBER OF FUNDS AND FOUNDATIONS AS ??FUNDING PARTNERS? ON ITS WEBSITE INCLUDING THE ROCKEFELLER BROTHERS FUND AND THE FORD FOUNDATION. (BOTH ORGANIZATIONS ALSO FUND THIS NONPROFIT NEWSROOM. CLICK HERE TO SEE A LIST OF ALL DONORS TO THE CENTER FOR PUBLIC INTEGRITY. THE CENTER ACCEPTS DONATIONS FROM DONOR-ADVISED FUNDS. IT ACCEPTS ANONYMOUS DONATIONS UP TO $250 AND ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS THEREAFTER UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE ORGANIZATION??S BOARD EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. THE CENTER DOES NOT ENGAGE IN POLITICAL ACTIVITY.) BUT THE PIPER FUND WEBSITE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGES IT RECEIVES MONEY FROM ANONYMOUS GIVERS AND ??NUMEROUS OTHER INDIVIDUAL DONORS.? IT DOES NOT EXPLAIN WHAT SHARE OF ITS FUNDING COMES FROM THESE UNNAMED DONORS. THE FUND??S DIRECTOR MELISSA SPATZ SAID THE MAINE DONATION CAME FROM A ??POOLED FUND.? THE GROUP EXISTS TO REDUCE THE INFLUENCE OF MONEY IN POLITICS AND BUILD A FAIR COURT SYSTEM SHE SAID. A NUMBER OF OTHER NONPROFIT FUNDERS OF THE MAINE BALLOT MEASURE ALSO DISCLOSE THEIR DONORS BUT IN A LIMITED MANNER. FOR EXAMPLE WASHINGTON D.C.-BASED CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM GROUP EVERY VOICE GAVE NEARLY $230000 ACCORDING TO STATE RECORDS. ITS WEBSITE LISTS DONORS WHO HAVE GIVEN $5000 OR MORE SINCE 2011 BUT INCLUDES IN THE LIST ??ANONYMOUS.? ADDING A LAYER OF COMPLEXITY IT ALSO RECEIVES FUNDS FROM OTHER ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING THE PIPER FUND WHOSE DONORS CAN??T BE FULLY TRACED. ??WE GO ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT IS REQUIRED OF US BY LAW TO DISCLOSE OUR DONORS? EVERY VOICE SPOKESWOMAN LAURA FRIEDENBACH SAID IN AN EMAIL. ??WE WILL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE RULES NO MATTER IF THERE ARE CHANGES IN DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS.? THE PRESIDENT OF ONE OF THE BALLOT MEASURE COMMITTEES FOR THE MAINE INITIATIVE ANDREW BOSSIE EMPHASIZED THAT HIS GROUP DISCLOSED EVERY DONOR. BUT ITS AFFILIATED EDUCATIONAL NONPROFIT WHICH GAVE MONEY TO THE COMMITTEE DOES NOT DISCLOSE ITS DONORS. THE RESULT: THE SOURCE OF THAT MONEY ISN'T CLEAR TO VOTERS. WHILE HE FAVORS DISCLOSURE BOSSIE SAID IT??S NOT FAIR FOR CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM GROUPS TO HAVE TO DISCLOSE EVERY DONOR. ??ASKING ONE PARTICULAR GROUP TO PLAY BY A DIFFERENT SET OF RULES JUST BECAUSE THEY??RE LOOKING TO CHANGE THOSE RULES IS A LITTLE BIT OF AN UNFAIR EXPECTATION? HE SAID. AND IT??S DIFFERENT WHEN GROUPS ARE GIVING TO BALLOT MEASURE CAMPAIGNS BOSSIE SAID BECAUSE DONORS CANNOT CORRUPT A BALLOT MEASURE LIKE THEY COULD A CANDIDATE. BUT GIVING VOTERS MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHO??S FINANCING A BALLOT MEASURE IS A GOOD ENOUGH REASON TO ASK FOR DISCLOSURE EVEN IF THE MEASURE CAN??T BE CORRUPTED SAID RICK HASEN A CAMPAIGN FINANCE REGULATION EXPERT AT UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE SCHOOL OF LAW. HASEN POINTED TO CALIFORNIA??S PROPOSITION 16 IN 2010 WHEN VOTERS REJECTED A PLAN TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR MUNICIPALITIES TO FORM THEIR OWN ELECTRIC UTILITIES. PACIFIC GAS & ELECTRIC WHICH STOOD TO LOSE CUSTOMERS IF CITIES STARTED THEIR OWN UTILITIES PROVIDED NEARLY ALL OF THE CAMPAIGN??S $46 MILLION IN FUNDING. ??ONCE THE PUBLIC LEARNED ABOUT THAT THE MEASURE WAS DEFEATED? HE SAID. ??AND SO DISCLOSURE IN BALLOT MEASURE ELECTIONS PROVIDES VOTERS WITH VALUABLE INFORMATION.? USING CONSERVATIVE ARGUMENTS THE D.C.-BASED NONPROFIT FOOD & WATER WATCH WHICH ADVOCATES FOR CLEAN WATER AND SAFE FOOD PRODUCTS LAST YEAR JOINED MORE THAN 60 OTHER ORGANIZATIONS IN SIGNING A LETTER ASKING PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA TO FORCE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTORS TO DISCLOSE THEIR POLITICAL SPENDING. ??HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE BEING INVESTED IN OUR ELECTIONS BY DONORS WHO REMAIN ANONYMOUS LEAVING VOTERS IN THE DARK ABOUT THE PEOPLE AND INTERESTS TO WHOM CANDIDATES ARE BEHOLDEN? THE LETTER STATED. BUT FOOD & WATER WATCH HAS ALSO INVESTED DOLLARS IN ELECTIONS FROM UNKNOWN SOURCES. THE GROUP SPENT MORE THAN $600000 SINCE 2012 SUPPORTING BALLOT MEASURES THAT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED LABELS ON GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS ACCORDING TO DATA FROM THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON MONEY IN STATE POLITICS. IN ITS 2013 ANNUAL REPORT THE MOST RECENT AVAILABLE ONLINE FOOD & WATER WATCH EMPHASIZES THAT IT DOES NOT TAKE MONEY FROM CORPORATIONS OR GOVERNMENTS AND LISTS SOME FOUNDATIONS THAT HAVE GIVEN TO IT. HOWEVER IT THANKS ??ANONYMOUS FUNDERS AND SUPPORTERS? AND DOES NOT LIST INDIVIDUAL DONORS. ??THAT??S IN ORDER TO PROTECT THEM FROM BLOWBACK FROM THE GROUPS THAT WE??RE CRITIQUING? SAID KATE FRIED POLICY COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR THE GROUP. BUT PROTECTION FROM BLOWBACK IS THE SAME ARGUMENT THAT MANY CONSERVATIVES MAKE AGAINST MANDATES THAT NONPROFITS DISCLOSE THEIR DONORS OR THAT GOVERNMENT CONTRACTORS DISCLOSE THEIR POLITICAL GIVING TO SUCH GROUPS. THEY OFTEN POINT TO THE 1958 CASE NAACP V. ALABAMA IN WHICH THE U.S. SUPREME COURT RULED THAT THE STATE COULD NOT FORCE THE CIVIL RIGHTS GROUP TO DIVULGE ITS DONOR LISTS AS ITS CONTRIBUTORS COULD FACE THREATS OR PERSECUTION. ??IT??S OBVIOUSLY HYPOCRITICAL? SAID DAVID KEATING PRESIDENT OF THE CENTER FOR COMPETITIVE POLITICS A CONSERVATIVE NONPROFIT THAT DOES NOT DISCLOSE ITS DONORS AND ARGUES AGAINST DISCLOSURE. ??IT ALSO PROVES OUR POINT THAT MANY DONORS DO VALUE THEIR PRIVACY AND WON??T GIVE MONEY IF THEY KNOW THEIR INFORMATION IS GOING TO POST.? DIFFERENCES IN DISCLOSURE NONPROFIT GROUPS?? DISCLOSURE POLICIES VARY. SOME CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM GROUPS LIST DONORS ONLINE SOME DISCLOSE DONORS IF ASKED. SOME ONLY DISCLOSE GIFTS FROM INSTITUTIONS OTHERS LIST INSTITUTIONS AND INDIVIDUALS. SOME ACCEPT ANONYMOUS MONEY SOME DO NOT. SOME DO NOT LIST GIFT AMOUNTS WHATSOEVER OTHERS LIST FUNDERS BY DOLLAR RANGES. NEARLY ALL THE GROUPS IDENTIFIED BY THE CENTER FOR PUBLIC INTEGRITY THAT PARTIALLY DISCLOSED THEIR FUNDING ALSO ACCEPTED WHAT APPEARED TO BE ANONYMOUS MONEY FROM DONOR-ADVISED FUNDS. THIS MEANS THE GIFTS OFFICIALLY CAME FROM ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE TIDES FOUNDATION OR VANGUARD CHARITABLE ENDOWMENT PROGRAM AT THE RECOMMENDATION OF A DONOR WHO REMAINS UNKNOWN TO THE PUBLIC. OUT OF THE 21 GROUPS THAT THE CENTER FOR PUBLIC INTEGRITY FOUND USING UNTRACEABLE MONEY EVEN AS THEY DENOUNCED IT 16 DISCLOSED DONORS IN SOME WAY. BUT ALL OF THEIR DONOR LISTS HAD SHORTCOMINGS: SOME ACCEPTED ANONYMOUS MONEY OTHERS DID NOT LIST AMOUNTS GIVEN OR INDIVIDUAL NAMES. ONE GROUP DEMOCRACY INITIATIVE SEEMED TO HAVE NO DONOR DISCLOSURE ONLINE AND DID NOT RESPOND TO THE CENTER FOR PUBLIC INTEGRITY??S INQUIRIES ABOUT ITS POLICIES. ANOTHER GROUP AMERICAN FAMILY VOICES DOES NOT DISCLOSE ITS DONORS. BUT LAST YEAR THE CENTER FOR PUBLIC INTEGRITY SHOWED THAT THE GROUP RECEIVED BIG CONTRIBUTIONS FROM LARGE UNIONS ENVIRONMENTAL INTERESTS AND A MAJOR CORPORATE RETAIL LOBBYING GROUP. THE GROUP DID NOT RESPOND TO REQUESTS FOR COMMENT. THE FINAL THREE ORGANIZATIONS ?? U.S. PUBLIC INTEREST RESEARCH GROUP PEOPLE FOR THE AMERICAN WAY AND FREE SPEECH FOR PEOPLE ?? SAID THAT THEY DO NOT PUBLICLY DISCLOSE DONORS. FREE SPEECH FOR PEOPLE PRESIDENT JOHN BONIFAZ SAID THAT HIS GROUP PLANS TO CREATE A POLICY THIS MONTH THAT WOULD DISCLOSE DONORS BUT STILL ALLOW FOR ANONYMOUS GIFTS. HE SAID IT RECEIVED ONLY TWO ANONYMOUS GIFTS IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS. U.S. PIRG GAVE MORE THAN $5000 TO THE MAINE BALLOT MEASURE AND CUT FIVE-FIGURE CHECKS TO TWO CLEAN ENERGY BALLOT MEASURES IN 2004 AND 2006 ACCORDING TO STATE RECORDS AND DATA FROM THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON MONEY IN STATE POLITICS. SPOKESMAN CHRIS MACKENZIE SAID THE ORGANIZATION DOESN??T LIST ITS DONORS?? NAMES BECAUSE THEY GIVE SUCH SMALL AMOUNTS: LESS THAN 2 PERCENT OF ITS DONATIONS OVER THE PAST 45 YEARS CAME IN CONTRIBUTIONS OF MORE THAN $5000. U.S. PIRG DOES NOT DISCLOSE EVEN ITS LARGEST DONORS MACKENZIE SAID ??BECAUSE THEY??RE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF WHERE WE RECEIVE THE BULK OF OUR FUNDING AND BECAUSE WE AREN??T REQUIRED TO BY LAW. HOWEVER WE WOULD WELCOME LAWS THAT INCREASE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR LARGE DONORS.? PEOPLE FOR THE AMERICAN WAY WHICH DOES NOT DISCLOSE ITS DONORS HAS USED ITS FUNDS TO PAY FOR ADS ABOUT CANDIDATES INCLUDING TV MESSAGES ABOUT REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE MITT ROMNEY IN 2012 AND U.S. SENATE CANDIDATES IN 2014. ??AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE ONE SIDE PLAYS BY ONE SET OF RULES AND THE OTHER PLAYS BY THE OTHER SET OF RULES IS NOT A GOOD PLACE TO BE? SAID MARGE BAKER AN EXECUTIVE AT THE GROUP WHICH ADVOCATES AGAINST ANONYMOUS MONEY AND SUPPORTS DISCLOSURE LEGISLATION. ??THIS SHOULDN??T BE VOLUNTARY. THIS SHOULD BE MANDATORY. EVERYBODY SHOULD BE PLAYING BY THE SAME SET OF RULES AND WE??RE GOING TO FIGHT TOOTH AND NAIL TO DO THAT.? BAKER SAID EVEN THOUGH HER GROUP ISN??T LEGALLY REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE ITS DONORS IT??S CONSIDERING ADOPTING A POLICY TO VOLUNTARILY DISCLOSE SOME DONORS BECAUSE IT VALUES TRANSPARENCY. ON THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM IS THE SUNLIGHT FOUNDATION. THOUGH IT DOES NOT SPEND ANY MONEY ON ELECTIONS THE GROUP ITEMIZES DONATIONS ON ITS WEBSITE LISTING EACH DONOR NAME AMOUNT AND THE PURPOSE OF THE GIFT. BUT EVEN SUNLIGHT??S EXTENSIVE DISCLOSURE HAS LIMITS. FOR INSTANCE THOUGH ITS POLICY IS NOT TO ACCEPT ANONYMOUS GIFTS OVER $250 IN 2015 SUNLIGHT ACCEPTED THREE DONATIONS FROM DONOR-ADVISED FUNDS AT THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF ANONYMOUS DONORS. ONE OF THE GIFTS WAS $25000 AS DISCLOSED ON ITS WEBSITE. ??SUNLIGHT HAS A STRONG PREFERENCE FOR DETAILED PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF ALL THE SOURCES OF OUR FUNDING ONLINE AND WE'RE PROUD OF THE WAY WE PUBLISH THAT INFORMATION? COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR JENN TOPPER SAID IN AN EMAIL. ??WE REVIEW EACH SITUATION CAREFULLY AND DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION WE CAN.? SOME PRO-TRANSPARENCY GROUPS LACK FORMAL POLICIES ON WHETHER TO DISCLOSE THEIR DONORS. PIPER FUND AND ITS PARENT ORGANIZATION THE PROTEUS FUND DO NOT HAVE A WRITTEN POLICY ON DONOR DISCLOSURE. BUT THAT COULD BE CHANGING SOON. ??YOUR EMAIL TRIGGERED SOME CONVERSATIONS WITHIN PIPER THAT I THINK WERE REALLY HEALTHY? DIRECTOR SPATZ TOLD THE CENTER FOR PUBLIC INTEGRITY. ??BECAUSE OF YOUR EMAIL I EMAILED WITH MY COLLEAGUES AT THE PROTEUS FUND AND WE'RE STARTING TO DEVELOP ONE.? SPATZ EXPECTS TO HAVE A POLICY IN PLACE IN 2016.

THAT WAS HOW I LEARNED THAT THE PROVINCIAL CAPITAL A KEY TO THE WEST OF THE COUNTRY HAD BEEN LIBERATED FROM THE SO-CALLED ISLAMIC STATE OR AS THE ARABS SAY DAESH. IT HAD BEEN OVER ONE AND A HALF YEARS SINCE JABER HAD LAST SEEN HIS NATIVE CITY. IT WAS A BITTER-SWEET MOMENT. ??I AM HAPPY BECAUSE WE LIBERATED THE CITY FROM THESE CRIMINALS? HE TOLD ME. BUT HE WAS HEARTBROKEN TO SEE RAMADI REDUCED TO RUBBLE. JABER HAD DRIVEN FROM BAGHDAD ACCOMPANYING GOVERNOR SUHAIB AL-RAWI THE CHIEF OF THE POLICE AND LOCAL SECURITY FORCES. HE FOUND RAMADI DESERTED. ONLY THE COUNTER-TERRORISM FORCES??WHO HAD CONDUCTED MOST OF THE FIGHTING TO LIBERATE THE CITY??WERE VISIBLE IN THE STREETS. BEFORE DAESH HAD TAKEN OVER AROUND 600000 PEOPLE HAD LIVED THERE. NOW ONLY A FEW THOUSAND REMAINED AND SOME OF THOSE WERE TRAPPED IN ENCLAVES STILL CONTROLLED BY DAESH. AND WHILE THE SO-CALLED ISLAMIC STATE IS LOSING TERRITORY IT REMAINS ABLE TO CONDUCT DEADLY OPERATIONS LIKE THOSE CARRIED OUT MONDAY AT A SHOPPING MALL IN BAGHDAD AND IN MUQDADIYAH. AIRSTRIKES AND BOMBS PLANTED IN HOUSES AND ALONGSIDE ROADS HAD LEFT RAMADI IN RUINS. WHOLE NEIGHBORHOODS HAD BEEN LEVELED. POWER LINES WERE DOWN. INFRASTRUCTURE WAS TOTALLY DESTROYED. AND THE BRIDGES ACROSS THE EUPHRATES??ONE OF WHICH DATED BACK TO THE BRITISH TIME IN IRAQ IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE LAST CENTURY??WERE NO MORE. AS JABER WALKED THROUGH THE CARCASS OF WHAT HAD ONCE BEEN ANBAR UNIVERSITY HE TOLD ME HE BROKE DOWN IN TEARS. ON GRADUATING FROM BAGHDAD MEDICAL COLLEGE IN THE 1980S JABER HAD HELPED ONE OF HIS PROFESSORS TAREQ AL-HADITHI SET UP THE COLLEGE OF MEDICINE IN ANBAR UNIVERSITY. AFTER 2003 JABER HAD POURED HIS ENERGIES INTO RENOVATING THE UNIVERSITY AND ESTABLISHING STUDENT DORMITORIES. HE HAD SHOWN THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR AROUND THE UNIVERSITY AND THEY HAD DISCUSSED ESTABLISHING A FRENCH LANGUAGE INSTITUTE. NOW ALL THOSE DREAMS OF INVESTING IN FUTURE GENERATIONS HAD DISINTEGRATED. HE COULD NOT EVEN MAKE OUT WHERE THE MEDICAL LABORATORIES HAD ONCE BEEN. ??I HAVE SO MANY GOOD MEMORIES FROM THIS CITY??.? HIS VOICE TRAILED OFF. JABER HAD BUILT A NEW HOUSE THERE A FEW YEARS AGO. ??LAST TIME I WAS HERE EVERYTHING LOOKED FINE.? NOW ALL HIS POSSESSIONS WERE STOLEN AND HIS HOUSE MERE DEBRIS. WHEN DAESH HAD MOVED INTO RAMADI JABER AND TWO OF HIS SISTERS HAD MOVED TO BAGHDAD. TWO OF HIS BROTHERS LEFT TO AMMAN. ANOTHER SISTER HAD GONE TO IRAQI KURDISTAN JOINING THE MAJORITY OF RAMADI??S RESIDENTS. WHILE THOSE WITH MONEY RENTED PLACES MANY LIVED IN TENTS IN CAMPS RELYING ON FAMILY AND FRIENDS TO MAKE ENDS MEET. THEY HAD SOLD THEIR GOLD AND WHATEVER THEY COULD TAKE WITH THEM BEFORE THEY FLED. JABER ESTIMATED THAT OVER 80 PERCENT OF IRAQ??S SUNNIS WERE DISPLACED FROM THEIR HOMES. DAESH HAD MURDERED JABER??S BROTHER-IN-LAW AND A NIECE WHO DIED WHEN THEY WERE TRYING TO KILL HER HUSBAND A MILITARY OFFICER. LIKE MANY OF ANBAR??S TRIBES LOYALTIES IN HIS FAMILY WERE MIXED. JABER REMAINED SUPPORTIVE OF THE GOVERNMENT AND WITH THE POLITICAL PROCESS WHEREAS ONE OF HIS BROTHERS WAS OPPOSED TO BOTH THE GOVERNMENT AND DAESH AND A SMALL PORTION OF HIS TRIBE WERE WITH DAESH. I PEPPERED JABER WITH QUESTIONS: HOW HAD EVERYTHING GONE SO BADLY WRONG IN RAMADI? HOW HAD DAESH BEEN ABLE TO TAKE OVER? WHO WERE THESE PEOPLE? JABER DESCRIBED A SUBCULTURE IN RAMADI OF UNEDUCATED MEN IN THEIR TWENTIES AND THIRTIES. SOME WERE THIEVES AND PETTY CRIMINALS. OTHERS HAD DEVELOPED FUNDAMENTALIST THINKING. AND WHEN AL-QAEDA IN IRAQ CAME INTO EXISTENCE AFTER THE FALL OF THE FORMER REGIME IT WAS WITHIN THAT ORGANIZATION THAT THEY FOUND A SENSE OF POWER AND IDENTITY. HOWEVER WHEN THE?ŸSAHWA THE ANBAR AWAKENING TURNED AGAINST AL-QAEDA AND ALIGNED WITH US FORCES DURING THE SURGE IN 2007 MANY OF THESE SAME YOUNG MEN WERE DRAWN AWAY FROM THE INSURGENCY AND SWAPPED SIDES TURNING THEMSELVES INTO LOCAL POLICE. AND THAT WAS WHY THE VIOLENCE IN ANBAR HAD DRAMATICALLY DECLINED FROM 2007 ONWARDS AND STABILITY HAD RETURNED TO THE PROVINCE. THE AGREEMENT THAT MY FORMER BOSS GEN. RAYMOND ODIERNO THE THEN-COMMANDER OF U.S. FORCES IN IRAQ HAD NEGOTIATED WITH FORMER PRIME MINISTER NURI AL-MALIKI WAS THAT 20 PERCENT OF THE?ŸSAHWA?ŸWOULD BE INTEGRATED INTO THE SECURITY FORCES AND 80 PERCENT INTO CIVILIAN JOBS. BUT THE DEAL WAS NEVER IMPLEMENTED. RATHER AS U.S. FORCES WITHDREW MALIKI RENEGED ON HIS PROMISES TO THE SAHWA?ŸAND ARRESTED ITS LEADERS. HE ACCUSED SUNNI POLITICIANS OF TERRORISM DRIVING THEM OUT OF THE POLITICAL PROCESS. IN RESPONSE SUNNIS SET UP PROTEST CAMPS. BUT MALIKI REFUSED TO MEET THEIR DEMANDS AND SENT IN SECURITY FORCES TO VIOLENTLY CRUSH THE DEMONSTRATIONS. WITH THE CITIZENS OF RAMADI SO AT ODDS WITH THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT ONCE AGAIN IT HAD BEEN EASY FOR DAESH TO RISE UP OUT OF THE ASHES OF AL-QAEDA IN IRAQ AND PROCLAIM ITSELF AS THE DEFENDER OF THE SUNNIS. DAESH HAD TAKEN OVER ANBAR UNIVERSITY AND CONVERTED IT INTO A PRISON. JABER EXPLAINED THAT THE TRIBES IN ANBAR HAD LOST TRUST IN THE GOVERNMENT AND REFUSED TO FIGHT DAESH. THEY REMEMBERED ONLY TOO CLEARLY HOW THE?ŸSAHWA?ŸHAD BEEN BETRAYED. ??WE COULD NOT CONVINCE THEM THAT THE EXPERIENCE WOULD BE DIFFERENT FROM BEFORE.? FINALLY 9000 TRIBESMEN WERE PERSUADED TO JOIN THE TRIBAL?ŸAL-HASHD THE POPULAR MOBILIZATION FORCE AND RECEIVED TRAINING FROM U.S. TROOPS IN BASES AT TAQQADUM AND AL-ASAD. AND IT WAS THESE TRIBESMAN WHO HAD SUPPORTED THE COUNTER-TERRORISM FORCES IN THEIR EFFORTS TO LIBERATE RAMADI FROM DAESH AT THE END OF 2015. GOVERNOR AL-RAWI HAS BEEN NOMINATED AS THE HEAD OF THE CRISIS COMMITTEE WHICH INCLUDES REPRESENTATIVES OF MINISTRIES AND IS TASKED WITH CLEANING UP THE CITY REMOVING EXPLOSIVES AND RESTORING BASIC SERVICES TO MAKE RAMADI INHABITABLE ONCE MORE SO THAT ITS DISPLACED CITIZENS WILL RETURN. BUT DIFFICULT TIMES REMAIN AHEAD. THERE ARE HUGE CHALLENGES TO REBUILDING RAMADI PARTICULARLY WITH SCARCE RESOURCES AVAILABLE FROM THE GOVERNMENT DUE TO THE STEEP DROP IN OIL PRICES TO UNDER $35 A BARREL. AND LOOMING LARGE IS THE QUESTION OF HOW TO BREAK THE CORROSIVE CYCLE OF REVENGE AND RETRIBUTION THAT HAS LED TO SO MANY DEATHS AND DISPLACEMENT. JABER WAS RECENTLY APPOINTED TO THE NEW HIGHER COMMITTEE FOR NATIONAL RECONCILIATION ESTABLISHED UNDER THE AUSPICES OF IRAQ??S PRIME MINISTER THE PRESIDENT AND THE SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT AND WITH THE MANDATE TO PROMOTE ??HISTORIC NATIONAL RECONCILIATION.? RECONCILIATION HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT CONTINUALLY IN IRAQ OVER THE LAST DECADE??BUT LITTLE HAS BEEN DONE TO ADDRESS THE STRUCTURAL CHALLENGES FACING THE COUNTRY TO AGREE ON A WORKABLE SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT AND TO REINVENT AN INCLUSIVE NATIONAL IDENTITY TO WHICH IRAQI??S DIVERSE PEOPLES CAN RELATE. MANY OBSERVERS BELIEVE THAT IRAQ IS FINISHED: THE KURDS ARE MOVING INCREASINGLY TOWARDS INDEPENDENCE SHIA MILITIAS DOMINATE THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT IRANIAN INFLUENCE IS PERVASIVE AND SUNNI LEADERSHIP IS WEAK AND FRAGMENTED. JABER KNOWS THE CHALLENGES FACING IRAQ ONLY TOO WELL. BUT HE STILL CLINGS ON TO HOPE. PRIME MINISTER HAYDER ABADI IS WORKING HARD TO KEEP IRAQ UNIFIED. SALIM JABOURI THE SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT IS SUPPORTIVE OF HIM AS IS PRESIDENT FUAD MASOUM. ALTHOUGH THEY ARE WEAK THE CURRENT INCUMBENTS OF THESE KEY POSITIONS APPEAR TO BE WORKING TOGETHER FOR THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY??A STARK CONTRAST WITH THE MALIKI ERA. ??THIS IS THE LAST CHANCE TO HOLD IRAQ TOGETHER? JABER OPINED ??TO MAKE EVERYONE THINK OF THEMSELVES FIRST AS IRAQIS BEFORE SUNNI SHIA OR KURD.? ,18195.0

439,9809455.0,2016-01-11T05:01:00+00:00,WHAT??S REALLY BEHIND THE SAUDI-IRAN CLASH?,"ONCE MORE SAUDI ARABIA IS EXECUTING PRISONERS EN MASSE ONCE MORE IRANIANS ARE STORMING FOREIGN EMBASSIES. BOTH COUNTRIES ARE REGRESSING TO THEIR BASEST SELVES. THE QUESTION IS: WHY AND PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY WHY NOW? TIMING IS EVERYTHING HERE. SAUDI ARABIA??S JANUARY 2 EXECUTION OF THE SHIA CLERIC NIMR AL-NIMR A SAUDI NATIONAL AND VOCIFEROUS CRITIC OF THE REGIME WAS A CALCULATED PROVOCATIVE MOVE. IRAN THE WORLD??S PREMIER SHIA STATE HAD REPEATEDLY MADE IT CLEAR TO RIYADH THAT AL-NIMR??S DEATH WOULD RESULT IN GRAVE CONSEQUENCES. AND SO IT PROVED. ON THE EVENING OF JANUARY 2 IRANIAN PROTESTORS STORMED THE SAUDI EMBASSY IN TEHRAN AND SET IT ALIGHT. POLICE LOOKED ON (CLEARLY THE STORMING HAD TACIT APPROVAL FROM THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT) BEFORE THEY EVENTUALLY DROVE THE PROTESTORS BACK. BUT THE DAMAGE HAD BEEN DONE. A SHORT WHILE LATER SAUDI ARABIA OFFICIALLY BROKE OFF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH IRAN. SINCE THEM SUNNI-SHIA TENSIONS HAVE BEEN INTENSIFYING TO EVEN MORE DANGEROUS LEVELS. RECEIVED WISDOM SAYS THESE EVENTS ARE MERELY THE LATEST BLOWS IN A CONTINUING SUNNI-SHIA SECTARIAN BATTLE THAT IS CLEAVING THE MIDDLE EAST. TO A DEGREE THIS IS CORRECT. TEN YEARS AGO JORDAN??S RULER KING ABDULLAH II WARNED OF THE DANGERS OF WHAT HE TERMED THE ??SHIA CRESCENT???THE ARC OF MAJORITY OR LARGE-MINORITY SHIA COMMUNITIES STRETCHING FROM LEBANON TO BAHRAIN. THE CENTER OF SHIA POWER JORDAN??S ABDULLAH ARGUED WAS IRAN WHICH HAS SINCE SEEN ITS INFLUENCE GROW DRAMATICALLY FOLLOWING THE 2003 IRAQ WAR. IRAN NOW PURSUES AN UNASHAMEDLY AGGRESSIVE FOREIGN POLICY ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST WHETHER IT IS FIGHTING WARS IN SYRIA AND YEMEN OR TRYING TO CONTROL THE POLITICS OF IRAQ AND LEBANON. SAUDI ARABIA THE ??SUNNI LION? WHICH IS BOTH THE RICHEST AND (WITH EGYPT DESTABILIZED) THE MOST POWERFUL SUNNI STATE IN THE REGION HAS SOUGHT TO COUNTERBALANCE IRAN IN ALL THESE AREAS. THE SAUDIS ARE TERRIFIED OF IRANIAN HEGEMONY AND A FEW YEARS BACK EVEN URGED THE U.S. TO \CUT OFF THE HEAD OF THE SNAKE? BY STRIKING IRAN??S NUCLEAR PROGRAM. SAUDI ARABIA AND IRAN ARE NOW EFFECTIVELY FIGHTING PROXY WARS IN SEVERAL THEATERS ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST. SINCE THE JULY 14 NUCLEAR DEAL BETWEEN IRAN AND THE P5+1 (THE FIVE UN SECURITY COUNCIL POWERS AND GERMANY) WHICH WILL END THE INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS ON IRAN SAUDI FEARS OF INCREASED IRANIAN POWER HAVE ONLY DEEPENED WHILE RELATIONS WITH WASHINGTON HAVE DETERIORATED. IN SAUDI EYES PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA HAS CHOSEN ATTEMPTS AT D??TENTE WITH IRAN OVER WASHINGTON??S LONGSTANDING TIES WITH RIYADH. THE COUNTRY NOW VIEWS ITSELF AS LARGELY ALONE IN THE FIGHT AGAINST IRAN. SO THE ANIMOSITY IS VERY REAL ON BOTH SIDES. BUT IN TRUTH IT IS OFTEN MORE POLITICAL THAN RELIGIOUS. BOTH COUNTRIES SEE THEMSELVES AS NATURAL LEADERS OF THE ISLAMIC MIDDLE EAST AND GEOSTRATEGIC COMPETITION BETWEEN THE TWO SEES EACH USE THE TROPES AND LANGUAGE OF RELIGION TO CLOAK WHAT ARE IN TRUTH POLITICAL ENDS. IRAN IS ESPECIALLY GOOD AT THIS CALLING ON SHIA JIHADIS TO GO TO SYRIA OSTENSIBLY TO PROTECT THE SAYYIDAH ZAYNAB SHRINE NEAR DAMASCUS BUT IN REALITY TO HELP SAFEGUARD SYRIAN PRESIDENT BASHAR AL-ASSAD AND IN SO DOING SECURE IRAN??S LAND BRIDGE THROUGH SYRIA TO HEZBOLLAH IN LEBANON. SET IN THIS CONTEXT THESE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS BECOME MORE EASILY UNDERSTANDABLE. THAT THEY ARE POLITICAL IS UNDOUBTED. WHAT MAKES THEM SO INTERESTING IS THAT THIS TIME IT IS DOMESTIC FACTORS THAT HAVE PUSHED EACH SIDE TO RATCHET UP HOSTILITIES. SINCE THE IRAN DEAL WHICH SAW WASHINGTON SEEMINGLY WILLING TO IGNORE SAUDI CONCERNS REGARDING IRAN??S NUCLEAR PROGRAM THE SAUDIS ARE FEELING MORE ISOLATED THAN THEY HAVE IN A LONG TIME. AND THE TIMING COULD NOT BE WORSE. AT $34 A BARREL OIL PRICES ARE AT THEIR LOWEST SINCE THE 1990S??A SERIOUS BLOW TO THE COUNTRY??S ECONOMY. RIYADH IS NOW FACING AN UNPRECEDENTED $98 BILLION BUDGET DEFICIT AND WAS RECENTLY FORCED TO RAISE GAS PRICES BY 50 PERCENT. THIS IS DANGEROUS FOR A STATE THAT KEEPS ITS POPULATION (LARGELY) QUIET BY EXTENSIVE STATE SUBSIDIES AND HIGH-PAYING JOBS. IF ITS ABILITY TO BRIBE ITS POPULATION EFFECTIVELY INTO QUIESCENCE IS THREATENED THEN THE STABILITY OF THE STATE ITSELF IS AT RISK. ADDED TO THIS THE RECENT ASCENSION OF KING SALMAN TO THE THRONE HAS SEEN THE KINGDOM INTRODUCE A NEW MORE AGGRESSIVE FOREIGN POLICY NOTABLY THROUGH MILITARY ACTION IN YEMEN THAT HAS SO FAR PROVED COSTLY WITH LITTLE RESULT. WITH TENSIONS AT HOME AND FOREIGN POLICY FAILURES ABROAD THE REGIME NEEDS TO MAKE SURE THAT ITS PEOPLE DO NOT BECOME RESTLESS AND DO THE UNTHINKABLE: START TO QUESTION THEIR LEADERS. WHAT THE REGIME NEEDS IS A DISTRACTION AND THERE IS NO BETTER DISTRACTION THAT THE SHIA ENEMY??THE BOGEYMAN THAT IS ALMOST GUARANTEED TO UNITE SUNNIS BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST. IN THIS SENSE WHEN THE IRANIANS ALLOWED THEIR PEOPLE TO VIOLATE ALL NORMS OF DIPLOMATIC PROTOCOL BY STORMING THE SAUDI EMBASSY IN TEHRAN THEY PLAYED RIGHT INTO SAUDI HANDS. BUT THEY DID SO WILLINGLY. KHAMENEI HAS HIS OWN POINT TO PROVE TO HIS PEOPLE AND TO THE WATCHING WORLD. AND JUST LIKE THE SAUDIS HE HAS USED AL-NIMR??S EXECUTION TO MAKE IT. KHAMENEI HAD NEEDED THE NUCLEAR DEAL TO LIFT SANCTIONS ON IRAN BUT THIS NEED BROUGHT WITH IT SIGNIFICANT DANGER: NAMELY THAT HE RISKED COMPROMISING THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC??S CORE PRINCIPLE OF DEFIANCE IN THE FACE OF THE GREAT SATAN THE U.S. KHAMENEI HAS TO PROVE TO THE HARDLINERS THAT BACK HIM THAT WHILE IRAN MAY BE OPENING UP TO THE GLOBAL ECONOMY IT WILL REMAIN TRUE TO ITS ROOTS. AND THERE IS NO BETTER WAY TO SHOW THE WORLD THAT THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC REMAINS A FOE OF ??IMPERIALISM? THAN STORMING AN EMBASSY. THE SYMBOLISM IS INESCAPABLE RECALLING AS IT DOES THE 1979-80 HOSTAGE CRISIS WHEN IRANIAN PROTESTORS STORMED THE US EMBASSY IN TEHRAN AND HELD THOSE INSIDE CAPTIVE FOR 444 DAYS. ALLOWING THE SAUDI EMBASSY TO BE STORMED HAS ENABLED KHAMENEI TO ACHIEVE TWO THINGS. ONE HE HAS INCREASED ANTI-SAUDI FEELING IN IRAN??THE LOW OIL PRICES ALSO DRASTICALLY AFFECT THE IRANIAN ECONOMY AND THE MULLAHS CAN DO WITH A DISTRACTING BOGEYMAN OF THEIR OWN. TWO HE HAS REASSURED HIS BASE THAT THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC IS NOT GOING ??SOFT? AFTER COMPROMISING OVER ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM. BUT WHILE BOTH POWERS ARE CONCERNED WITH SHORING UP THEIR DOMESTIC BASE THE LATEST CRISIS BETWEEN THEM COULD NOT HAVE COME AT A WORSE TIME FOR THE MIDDLE EAST. LAST OCTOBER THE SAUDIS AND IRANIANS FINALLY CAME TOGETHER IN VIENNA FOR PEACE TALKS DESIGNED TO TRY TO END THE SYRIAN CIVIL WAR. WITH BOTH COUNTRIES SO HEAVILY INVESTED IN THE WAR??IRAN BACKS ASSAD AND THE SAUDIS BACK SUNNI OPPOSITION GROUPS DETERMINED TO OUST HIM??THERE IS LITTLE CHANCE OF A SUSTAINABLE PEACE WITHOUT THEIR INPUT. TALKS ARE SUPPOSED TO CONTINUE ON JAN. 25 BUT SINCE AL-NIMR??S EXECUTION SECTARIAN RHETORIC FROM BOTH SIDES HAS INCREASED AND FELLOW SUNNI GULF STATES HAVE ALSO BROKEN OFF RELATIONS WITH IRAN. ON JAN. 4 SAUDI FOREIGN MINISTER ADEL AL-JUBEIR WAS UNCHARACTERISTICALLY CONFRONTATIONAL. ??WE WILL NOT ALLOW IRAN TO DESTABILIZE OUR REGION? HE TOLD REUTERS. ??WE WILL NOT ALLOW IRAN TO DO HARM TO OUR CITIZENS OR THOSE OF OUR ALLIES AND SO WE WILL REACT.? IRAN-SAUDI RELATIONS ARE AT THEIR LOWEST POINT SINCE THE LATE 1980S AND THIS ENMITY NOW THREATENS TO DERAIL THE UPCOMING TALKS. OFFICIALS ARE WORRIED. STEFFAN DE MISTURA THE U.N. ENVOY TO SYRIA WAS CLEAR ON THE GRAVITY OF THE SITUATION: ??WE CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE THIS MOMENTUM DESPITE WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE REGION? HE SAID. GIVEN THAT THE TWO COUNTRIES ARE ALREADY BACKING DIFFERENT HORSES IN SYRIA THE LATEST CRISIS IS LIKELY TO MAKE THE ADMITTEDLY DISTANT PROSPECT OF A SOLUTION IN SYRIA EVEN MORE REMOTE. """,7680.0

IT??S SO IMPORTANT TO HIM IN FACT THAT HE COMPARED THE IOWA SUPREME COURT??S 2009 DECISION LEGALIZING SAME-SEX MARRIAGE TO THE DRED SCOTT DECISION. HE THEN SPEARHEADED SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS IN 2010 TO VOTE OUT THREE OF THE JUSTICES WHO VOTED FOR IT (IN 2012 A PUSH TO OUSTER A FOURTH FAILED). ??I THINK IT WILL SEND A MESSAGE ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT POWER RESIDES WITH THE PEOPLE? HE SAID AT THE TIME. ??IT??S ??WE THE PEOPLE?? NOT ??WE THE COURTS.??? BUT HIS REACH HAS LIMITS. IN 2010 HE TOOK ON LONGTIME IOWA POL TERRY BRANSTAD IN THE STATE??S GUBERNATORIAL PRIMARY. HE MADE HIS CAMPAIGN PRACTICALLY SINGLE-ISSUE ON MARRIAGE -- AND HE LOST. DESPITE DEFEAT HIS CLOUT WITH IOWA CONSERVATIVES DIDN??T WANE. IN THE 2012 REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY HIS GROUP DRAFTED A MARRIAGE VOW THAT CANDIDATES HAD TO SIGN IF THEY WANTED TO BE CONSIDERED AS POTENTIAL ENDORSEES. SIGNATORIES PROMISED A ??STEADFAST EMBRACE? OF AN AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION TO BAN SAME-SEX MARRIAGE (VOW-SIGNERS ALSO PROMISED ??[R]EJECTION OF SHARIAH ISLAM? AND TO PROTECT WOMEN AND CHILDREN FROM ??ALL FORMS OF PORNOGRAPHY AND PROSTITUTION?). ONLY RICK SANTORUM RICK PERRY AND MICHELE BACHMANN SIGNED ON. SANTORUM WENT ON TO NAB VANDER PLAATS?? ENDORSEMENT AND WIN THE IOWA CAUCUSES. IT WASN??T VANDER PLAATS?? FIRST TIME USING THE GOLDEN TOUCH VANDER PLAATS WAS THE STATE CHAIRMAN FOR GOV. MIKE HUCKABEE??S 2008 PRESIDENTIAL BID WHEN THE GOVERNOR WON THE CAUCUSES. CENTRAL TO VANDER PLAATS?? APPROACH IS THE BELIEF THAT GAY MARRIAGE MUST BE STOPPED IN THE U.S. -- NO EXCUSES NO EXCEPTIONS NO NONSENSE. DURING THE 2012 CONTEST HIS GROUP EXPLICITLY RULED OUT BACKING RON PAUL DUE TO HIS STANCE THAT INDIVIDUAL STATES SHOULD BE ABLE TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO RECOGNIZE SAME-SEX UNIONS. ??THE STUMBLING BLOCK FOR THE BOARD REGARDING REPRESENTATIVE PAUL DEALT PRIMARILY WITH ??STATES?? RIGHTS?? AS IT PERTAINS TO THE SANCTITY OF HUMAN LIFE AND GOD??S DESIGN FOR MARRIAGE? IT SAID IN A PRESS RELEASE. IN VANDER PLAATS?? THINKING GIVING STATES THE RIGHT TO RECOGNIZE SAME-SEX MARRIAGES WAS AKIN TO LETTING THEM MAKE THEIR OWN CALLS ON SLAVERY OR ABORTION (TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE). NOW THOUGH THINGS SEEM A LITTLE DIFFERENT -- AND SOME OF VANDER PLAATS?? OLD ALLIES ARE A LITTLE BAFFLED. THAT??S BECAUSE VANDER PLAATS OPTED TO ENDORSE TED CRUZ. CRUZ OF COURSE IS NO ALLY OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY. THE TEXAS SENATOR ITERATES AND REITERATES AND RE-REITERATES THAT HE PERSONALLY OPPOSES GAY MARRIAGE. BUT HIS OFFICIAL STANCE IS THAT STATES SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS ON THE ISSUE. ??HE BELIEVES THAT SINCE THE CONSTITUTION DOES NOT MENTION MARRIAGE THE DEFINITION OF MARRIAGE IS UP TO THE STATES? EMAILED CAMPAIGN SPOKESMAN RICK TYLER. IN 2014 BARNEY FRANK PRAISED CRUZ??S VIEW AS ??AN EVOLUTION? ON THE ISSUE. THAT ISN??T WHAT VANDER PLAATS BELIEVES. IT ALSO ISN??T WHAT MIKE HUCKABEE AND RICK SANTORUM BELIEVE BOTH BACK A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO LIMIT MARRIAGE RIGHTS TO HETEROSEXUAL COUPLES. THUS VANDER PLAATS BACKS A CANDIDATE WHO HOLDS A POSITION ON MARRIAGE THAT HE HIMSELF SAID WAS DISQUALIFYING IN 2012. ??BOB IS A GOOD GUY BUT LIKE MOST POWER-BROKER ENDORSEMENTS HIS DECISIONS ARE BASED ON POLITICS MORE THAN PRINCIPLE? SAID JESSE BENTON PAUL??S CAMPAIGN CHAIR IN 2012. ??DR. PAUL WAS 100 PERCENT COMMITTED TO PRINCIPLE AND MANY FOUND NO POLITICAL ADVANTAGE IN SUPPORTING HIM. TED CRUZ IS MUCH MORE COMPROMISING AND ACCEPTABLE TO THE ESTABLISHMENT SO POWER BROKERS ARE HAPPY TO MANIPULATE THEIR OWN RULES TO GIVE HIM AN ADVANTAGE AND GAIN ACCESS TO TO HIM.? BENTON ISN??T THE ONLY ONE WHO SAYS VANDER PLAATS IS BEING INCONSISTENT. DREW IVERS A FORMER FINANCE CHAIRMAN FOR THE IOWA REPUBLICAN PARTY SAID VANDER PLAATS AND CRUZ SHARE A BIBLICAL VIEW OF MARRIAGE. BUT HE ADDED THAT VANDER PLAATS SEEMS TO HAVE SHIFTED HIS STANCE. ??HE IS FLIPPING IN THAT HE??S ABANDONING HIS SUPPORT OF A FEDERAL MARRIAGE AMENDMENT WHEREAS BEFORE THAT WAS HIS MAIN THRUST? IVERS SAID. AND ONE IOWA CONSERVATIVE EVANGELICAL ACTIVIST WHO VOLUNTEERED ON VANDER PLAATS?? 2010 GUBERNATORIAL CAMPAIGN SAID SHE WAS STUNNED THAT HE BACKED CRUZ. ??HE??S A VERY STRONG DEFENDER OF TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE? SHE SAID. ??AND ALWAYS ON THE STATES?? RIGHTS POSITION -- HE WAS ADAMANTLY AGAINST IT HE ALWAYS QUOTED ABRAHAM LINCOLN: STATES DON??T HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO WRONG.? ??IT??S CONFUSING? SHE SAID OF THE CRUZ ENDORSEMENT. ANOTHER LONG-TIME GRASSROOTS EVANGELICAL ACTIVIST ECHOED THAT FRUSTRATION. ??IT??S KIND OF A HEAD-SCRATCHER TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT? HE SAID. ??OF ALL OF THE CANDIDATES ALL OF THE CHOICES OUT THERE WHY WOULD YOU PICK CRUZ OF ALL PEOPLE?? ??A LOT OF PEOPLE I KNOW HAVE WONDERED THE SAME THING? HE CONTINUED. ??WHAT??S THIS ALL ABOUT IS THERE SOME KIND OF A PRE-PLANNED STRATEGY THAT WE DON??T KNOW ABOUT OR SOMETHING BEHIND THE SCENES? IT??S LIKE HE??S EITHER COMPLETELY CHANGED HIS VIEWS ON IT OR -- SOMETHING. I DON??T REALLY KNOW.? VANDER PLAATS?? GROUP DIDN??T RESPOND TO A REQUEST FOR COMMENT ON WHETHER HE??S FLIP-FLOPPED ON THE ISSUE. BUT FOR MANY CONSERVATIVE IOWANS HIS COMMENTS WON??T MATTER VANDER PLAATS VIEWED BY OUTSIDERS AS A TITAN OF PURITY HAS CAVED. ,7108.0

RABBI YOSHIYAHU YOSEF PINTO IS A CELEBRITY IN ISRAEL AND AMONG FINANCIAL AND REAL ESTATE ELITES IN NEW YORK. A SAGE WHOSE FOLLOWERS INCLUDE THE LEADERS OF ISRAEL??S BUSINESS ELITE PINTO IS THE DESCENDANT OF MOROCCAN JEWISH SAINTS A SEPHARDIC HERO AND A MASTER OF KABBALAH THE ANCIENT TRADITION OF JEWISH MYSTICISM AND MAGIC. HIS NET WORTH HAS BEEN ESTIMATED AT $19 MILLION NOT INCLUDING THE VAST SUMS UNDER THE CONTROL OF HIS VARIOUS NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. HE IS ALSO A FELON CONVICTED OF BRIBING AN ISRAELI POLICE GENERAL. THIS WEEK AFTER EXHAUSTING WHAT IS PROBABLY HIS LAST APPEAL??A LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO AVOID JAIL FOR HEALTH REASONS??IT APPEARS HE IS FINALLY HEADED FOR PRISON. ADDING INSULT TO INJURY A $30 MILLION DEFAMATION SUIT THE RABBI??S ORGANIZATION FILED AGAINST A REPORTER WAS DISMISSED BY A NEW YORK COURT THIS WEEK FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION. HOW DOES A KABBALIST WHO BY ALL ACCOUNTS IS INDEED A DEVOUT MAN WHO PRACTICES WHAT HE PREACHES BECOME A MULTI-MILLIONAIRE? IT??S THE NETWORK. IN NEW YORK PINTO??S CLOSE FOLLOWERS INCLUDE LEADING JEWISH REAL ESTATE MAGNATES LIKE OFER YARDENI AND CHARLIE KUSHNER POLITICIANS LIKE ANTHONY WIENER AND ERIC CANTOR JEWISH LEADERS INCLUDING CELEBRITY RABBI MARC SCHNEIER AND MALCOLM HOENLEIN (THE HEAD OF THE CONFERENCE OF PRESIDENTS OF AMERICAN JEWISH ORGANIZATIONS) AND EVEN LEBRON JAMES. FOLLOWERS BELIEVE THAT PINTO HAS SUPERNORMAL POWERS. MANY??INCLUDING GRIMM??SAID HE CAN READ MINDS. OTHERS SAY HE HAS THE ABILITY TO BLESS EVERYTHING FROM BUSINESS VENTURES TO POLITICAL CAREERS??AND TO CURSE ENEMIES AS WELL. LIKE OTHER KABBALISTS PINTO SPEAKS ONLY HEBREW IS SOFT SPOKEN AND KEEPS HIS EYES PARTLY CLOSED THE BETTER TO DETACH FROM WORLDLY CONCERNS. HE DISPENSES ADVICE BLESSINGS AND AMULETS. HE IS THE DESCENDANT BOTH OF THE FAMOUS MOROCCAN MYSTIC RABBI YISRAEL ABUHATZEIRA ALSO KNOWN AS THE BABA SALI AND OF RABBI HAIM PINTO ONE OF MOROCCO??S MOST POWERFUL RABBIS. AND HE WELCOMES EVERYONE: RELIGIOUS SECULAR JEWISH NON-JEWISH. BUT FOR A HOLY MAN PINTO IS SURROUNDED BY SHADY CRIMINAL ELEMENTS INCLUDING OUTRIGHT CROOKS. IN ISRAEL THESE INCLUDE YOSSI HARARI THE HEAD OF THE RAMAT AMIDAR UNDERWORLD GANG AND MOBSTER SHALOM DOMRANI. IN THE UNITED STATES THEY INCLUDE MICHAEL GRIMM THE FORMER STATEN ISLAND CONGRESSMAN CONVICTED OF TAX EVASION AND PERJURY. PINTO WAS NOT DIRECTLY IMPLICATED IN GRIMM??S CRIMES BUT HIS CLOSE ASSOCIATES WERE ALLEGEDLY THEY SOLICITED DONATIONS FOR GRIMM??S ELECTION CAMPAIGN FROM PINTO??S NETWORK OF FOLLOWERS IN EXCESS OF LEGALLY ALLOWABLE AMOUNTS. THERE WERE ALSO DUBIOUS CHARACTERS WITHIN PINTO??S OWN ORGANIZATION. IN 2011 THE JEWISH DAILY FORWARD DISCOVERED THAT A TOP AIDE BEN ZION SUKY HAD BEEN A PORNOGRAPHER. THEN THEY BROKE THE NEWS THAT PINTO??S ISRAELI CHARITY ??HAD SPENT TENS OF THOUSANDS ON A HIGH-END HOTEL FINE MEN??S CLOTHING AND JEWELRY AMONG OTHER LUXURIES.? BUT AS DESCRIBED IN A 2014 EXPOSE BY NEW YORK MAGAZINE THE EMPIRE REALLY BEGAN FALLING APART IN 2011 WHEN PINTO??S FORMER AIDE OFER BITON BEGAN TO TURN AGAINST HIM WITH THE HELP OF HIGH-FLYING PUBLICIST RONN TOROSSIAN. TOROSSIAN THREATENED PINTO??S ORGANIZATION WITH A NEGATIVE PR BLITZ AND THEN BEGAN TO CARRY IT OUT. BITON EXTORTED CASH. EVENTUALLY BOTH PINTO AND BITON WERE WORKING AS INFORMANTS. MEANWHILE ISRAELI AUTHORITIES STARTED INVESTIGATING PINTO??S CHARITIES FOR MISAPPROPRIATION OF FUNDS EVENTUALLY ARRESTING TEN EMPLOYEES. THAT??S WHEN PINTO??S WIFE PASSED ENVELOPES FULL OF CASH TO THE WIFE OF POLICE BRIGADIER GENERAL EPHRAIM BRACHA WHO HAD BEEN A FOLLOWER IN THE HOPES THAT BRACHA WOULD BLOCK THE INVESTIGATION. UNBEKNOWNST TO PINTO BRACHA WAS ACTUALLY PART OF IT. FACING YEARS IN PRISON PINTO TOOK A PLEA DEAL LAST SPRING AND ON MAY 12 HE RECEIVED THE LIGHTEST SENTENCE PERMISSIBLE UNDER LAW: ONE YEAR PLUS A FINE. ONE MONTH LATER BRACHA WHO HAD BEEN HOUNDED BY PINTO??S FOLLOWERS COMMITTED SUICIDE. BUT PINTO FLED TO NEW YORK PLEADING ILL HEALTH. AT THE END OF OCTOBER HIS ORGANIZATION PROFFERED A WEIRD ERROR-FILLED LETTER FROM A UROLOGIST URGING THAT THE RABBI NOT FLY BACK TO ISRAEL EVEN THOUGH THE RABBI ??INSISTS? UPON DOING SO. FOLLOWERS ASSAULTED REPORTERS COVERING THE CASE AND MADE THREATS TO WITNESSES WHO HAD TESTIFIED. BUT PINTO WAS SENT BACK. AND NOW HIS LAST APPEAL TO THE ISRAELI SUPREME COURT HAS BEEN REJECTED THE COURT SAID THAT ISRAELI PRISONS CAN PROVIDE WHATEVER MEDICAL CARE THE 43-YEAR-OLD RABBI NEEDS. AS REPORTED BY THE JEWISH DAILY FORWARD RABBI PINTO HAS FRAMED HIS TROUBLES IN THEOLOGICAL COSMOLOGICAL TERMS. LAST SUMMER HE TOLD FOLLOWERS: ??WE ARE PLAYING OUR PART IN A WIDESPREAD BATTLE A HOLY WAR.? AND IN A JULY 22 EMAIL HE SAID THAT HE HOPED ??THAT WHOEVER WAS INVOLVED IN THIS WILL?? COME CLEAN?? THUS WILL PREVENT GREAT SUFFERING UPON ALL THE LIVING AND THE DEAD.? IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE THOUGH TO LUMP PINTO IN WITH CORRUPT TELEVANGELISTS SEX-OFFENDING PRIESTS AND OTHER WAYWARD CLERICS. PINTO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BRIBES??THAT IS NOW A MATTER OF LAW??BUT HE DIDN??T GIVE THEM PERSONALLY. AND PINTO??S ORGANIZATION CLEARLY IS FILLED WITH UNSAVORY CHARACTERS??BUT THE RABBI HIMSELF APPEARS TO LEAD A MODEST LIFESTYLE DESPITE HIS GREAT WEALTH. ALL THIS MAKES THE RABBI SOMETHING OF AN ENIGMA. IT??S POSSIBLE THAT HE IS A CYNICAL SVENGALI A MANIPULATOR PULLING THE STRINGS OF POWER AND CONFUSING THE CREDULOUS. MAYBE THE PIETY AND THE MYSTICISM ARE ALL AN ACT. AT THE OTHER EXTREME MAYBE PINTO REALLY IS A PIOUS UNWORLDLY FIGURE POSSESSED OF SPIRITUAL GIFTS BUT SURROUNDED BY MEN WHO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIS NAIVET??. THAT??S PROBABLY NOT RIGHT EITHER??BUT MOST LIKELY THE TRUTH LIES SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN. PINTO??S CHARITIES HAVE SPENT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON SOCIAL SERVICES AND LAVISHED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS ON LUXURIES FOR STAFF. PINTO HIMSELF IS A MYSTICAL SAGE AND A CANNY OPERATOR. AS THE KABBALAH ITSELF TEACHES THE GOOD IS MIXED IN WITH THE BAD. WHICH IS HOW A MYSTICAL RABBI CAN ALSO BE HEADED FOR JAIL. ,25176.0

BUT ON CAPITOL HILL??FAR FROM MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN HATS??THEY CLEANED UP. CONSERVATIVES ON THE HILL EMBOLDENED BY REPUBLICAN GAINS IN THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS FOLLOWED THE BATTLE CRY OF THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION??S POWERFUL LOBBYING ARM AGAINST THEIR ESTABLISHMENT OVERLORDS. BUT OVER THE PAST YEAR THEY??VE FACED DEFEAT AFTER BITING DEFEAT. MOST OF THESE WINS WERE ON WONKY UNSEXY ISSUES??LIKE FUNDING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE CONSTRUCTION AND RULES ABOUT HOW THE PRESIDENT CAN NEGOTIATE TRADE AGREEMENTS. NOT EXACTLY THE MOST SCINTILLATING STUFF. ?ŸBUT WHILE THESE INDIVIDUAL DEBATES MAY NOT HAVE GALVANIZED NATIONAL ATTENTION THEY WERE HUGELY IMPORTANT TO TEA PARTY-FRIENDLY CONSERVATIVE GROUPS. AND THE CUMULATIVE LOSSES THESE GROUPS FACE SUGGEST THAT THEIR CLOUT MAY HAVE FLATLINED OR THEY OVERPLAYED THEIR HANDS. HERITAGE ACTION THE LOBBYING WING OF THE POWERFUL HERITAGE FOUNDATION THINK TANK GOT A MAJOR SHELLACKING IN MARCH DURING THE FIGHT OVER ??DOC FIX? LEGISLATION WHICH OVERHAULED HOW DOCTORS WHO TREAT MEDICARE PATIENTS GET REIMBURSED. HERITAGE ACTION KEY-VOTED AGAINST THE BILL CITING CONCERNS THAT IT WOULD GROW THE NATIONAL DEBT BY HALF A TRILLION DOLLARS OVER TWENTY YEARS. DESPITE THE GROUP??S PROTESTATIONS THOUGH THE DOC FIX PASSED THE HOUSE WITH JUST 37 NO VOTES (ONLY 4 OF WHOM WERE DEMOCRATS). IN THE SENATE JUST 8 MEMBERS VOTED AGAINST IT. IT WAS A TOUGH LOSS FOR HERITAGE ACTION. AND MANY MORE FOLLOWED. TRADE LEGISLATION DREW SIGNIFICANT OPPOSITION FROM THE GROUP IN JUNE AS MEMBERS FOUGHT OVER WHETHER CONGRESS WOULD GIVE THE PRESIDENT EXTRA AUTHORITY TO NEGOTIATE TRADE DEALS ALLOCATE FUNDS TO SUPPORT AMERICANS WHO LOSE JOBS DUE TO SAID DEALS. WHILE ISSUES LIKE TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE AND TRADE PROMOTION AUTHORITY MAY NOT ROLL OFF THE TONGUE OF YOUR AVERAGE TEA PARTIER (OR WELL YOUR AVERAGE HUMAN BEING) HERITAGE ACTION??S KEY-VOTING AGAINST TRADE PROVISIONS HELPED ENERGIZE GRASSROOTS CONSERVATIVE OPPOSITION. THAT COMBINED WITH BREITBART NEWS AND THE DRUDGE REPORT??S LIBERAL (AND FRANTIC) USE OF THE ??OBAMATRADE? MONIKER STOKED OPPOSITION ON THE RIGHT. AND ALL THOSE GUYS LOST. CONGRESS GAVE THE PRESIDENT ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY TO NEGOTIATE TRADE DEALS AND ALLOCATED MORE FUNDS TO HELP AMERICANS WHO LOSE JOBS TO OVERSEAS COMPETITION AND THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED HE PLANS TO HAVE THE U.S. SIGN ON TO THE NEW TRANS PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP TRADE DEAL. ??IS ANYONE STILL SCARED OF HERITAGE ACTION?? WONDERED NATIONAL JOURNAL. IT WAS A GOOD QUESTION. AND IT WAS A QUESTION THAT AROSE AGAIN IN JULY WHEN LEGISLATION CAME UP TO CHANGE FUNDING FOR THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH AND THE FDA. THE BILL WAS CALLED THE 21ST CENTURY CURES ACT AND WELL WAS COMPLICATED. HERITAGE ACTION OPPOSED IT ADAMANTLY FOR COMPARABLY COMPLICATED REASONS. IF NIH FUNDING MECHANISMS GET YOUR JUICES FLOWING CHECK OUT HERITAGE ACTION??S RELEASE EXPLAINING ITS STANCE. IF NOT JUST REST ASSURED THAT IT WAS A BIG DEAL FOR THE GROUP AND THE GROUP LOST.

NEXT TIME YOU??RE TRYING TO GET OUT OF AN UNPLEASANT CONVERSATION JUST BRING UP INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS. THE HIGHWAY BILL ALLOWED MORE THAN $300 BILLION FOR TRANSPORTATION SPENDING AND IT REAUTHORIZED THE EXPORT-IMPORT BANK??A PROGRAM THAT GIVES LOANS TO U.S. BUSINESSES THAT HAVE OVERSEAS COMMERCE AND THAT CONSERVATIVES HAVE LONG CRITICIZED AS CORPORATE WELFARE.

HERITAGE ACTION NATURALLY KEY-VOTED AGAINST IT. AND THE HOUSE AS WAS NATURAL IN 2015 PASSED IT ANYWAY. IT WASN??T ALWAYS THIS WAY. DURING THE 2013 GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN HERITAGE ACTION EXERTED ENORMOUS INFLUENCE TO PRESSURE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AGAINST SUPPORTING ANY FUNDING FOR THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.

THE FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE SAID LAST NIGHT AT FUSION??S BROWN & BLACK DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL FORUM THAT SHE IS OKAY WITH DEPORTING IMMIGRANT CHILDREN ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS BUT DOESN??T SUPPORT USING RAIDS TO APPREHEND THEM. HER COMMENTS COME IN THE WAKE OF A SERIES OF RAIDS CONDUCTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY TARGETING FAMILIES WHO FLED CENTRAL AMERICA IN 2014. ??LET ME SAY THIS? CLINTON TOLD THE PANEL OF QUESTIONERS. ??I WOULD GIVE EVERY PERSON BUT PARTICULARLY CHILDREN DUE PROCESS AND HAVE THEIR STORY TOLD. AND A LOT OF CHILDREN WILL OF COURSE HAVE VERY LEGITIMATE STORIES UNDER OUR LAW TO BE ABLE TO STAY.? SHE ADDED THAT SHE OPPOSES RAIDS ON IMMIGRANTS?? HOMES. ??THEY ARE DIVISIVE? SHE SAID. ??THEY ARE SOWING DISCORD AND FEAR.? HER NEW ANTI-RAID POSITION IS A SHARP DEPARTURE FROM HER PAST STANCES ON THE ISSUE. IN FACT AS RECENTLY AS 2014 SHE EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR SENDING UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN WHO CROSSED THE MEXICAN BORDER BACK TO THEIR HOME COUNTRIES. IMMIGRATION ATTORNEYS WHO REPRESENT CHILDREN SAY CLINTON CAN??T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS??GIVEN HER HISTORY OF SUPPORT FOR DEPORTATION-HEAVY ENFORCEMENT OF IMMIGRATION LAW THEY??RE NOT CONVINCED SHE??S HAD A CHANGE OF HEART. ??WHICH UNACCOMPANIED CHILD REFUGEE ISN??T DESERVING OF PROTECTION?? SAID MATTHEW KOLKEN AN IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY WHO REPRESENTS IMMIGRANT CHILDREN. ??HOW ARE THEY GOING TO DEPORT THEM? THEY??RE GOING TO HAVE TO DEPORT THEM BY GOING INTO THEIR HOMES TO PHYSICALLY TAKE THEM WHICH IS A RAID.? ??I DON??T BELIEVE A WORD THAT COMES OUT OF HER MOUTH? HE ADDED. BRYAN JOHNSON ANOTHER IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY WHO REPRESENTS CHILDREN AND FAMILIES SAID THAT SUPPORTING THE PRACTICE OF DEPORTING CHILDREN MEANS SUPPORTING RAIDS. ??IF ICE [IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT] IS GOING TO REMOVE A CHILD THAT??S ORDERED REMOVED AND THEY??RE A FUGITIVE TYPICALLY THE ONLY WAY FOR THEM TO DO THAT IS TO ARREST THEM WHEREVER THEY ARE? HE SAID. ??AND THAT??S WHAT A RAID IS BASICALLY. SO SHE THINKS SHE??S AGAINST RAIDS BUT AT THE SAME TIME SHE??S NOT.? SINCE THE NUMBER OF UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN ILLEGALLY CROSSING THE SOUTHERN BORDER SPIKED IN THE SUMMER OF 2014 THE WHITE HOUSE HAS MOVED TO TRY TO BURNISH ITS TOUGH-ON-IMMIGRATION BONA FIDES BY TAKING SOME CONTROVERSIAL STEPS??NAMELY LOCKING UP MOTHERS AND SMALL CHILDREN IN FAMILY DETENTION CENTERS RUN BY FOR-PROFIT PRISON COMPANIES AND CONDUCTING RAIDS AROUND THE COUNTRY TO APPREHEND AND DEPORT CHILDREN AND THEIR PARENTS WHO CAME HERE ILLEGALLY. MANY OF THESE YOUNG IMMIGRANTS COME TO THE U.S. SEEKING ASYLUM FROM CENTRAL AMERICAN GANG VIOLENCE. THE GUARDIAN REPORTED IN OCTOBER THAT MORE THAN 80 IMMIGRANTS THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION DEPORTED TO CENTRAL AMERICA WERE SUBSEQUENTLY MURDERED. WHILE CLINTON??S STATED OPPOSITION TO RAIDS IS NEW IT STILL MAKES HER THE MOST HAWKISH DEMOCRAT ON IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT. BERNIE SANDERS HAS PROMISED TO USE ??HUMANITARIAN PAROLE? TO LET SOME DEPORTED IMMIGRANTS RETURN TO THE U.S. LEGALLY. AND MARTIN O??MALLEY HAS CALLED FOR AN END TO ALL IMMIGRANT DETENTION EXCEPT IN CASES OF NATIONAL SECURITY OF SAFETY THREATS. COMPARED TO THOSE TWO CLINTON??S CURRENT STANCE DOESN??T LOOK PARTICULARLY PROGRESSIVE. BUT OVER THE COURSE OF HER POLITICAL CAREER SHE??S USED RHETORIC AND HELD POSITIONS ON THE ISSUE THAT WOULD SOUND RIGHT AT HOME ON THE 2016 REPUBLICAN DEBATE STAGE. IN THE 2008 DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY FOR INSTANCE SHE OPPOSED STATE-LEVEL POLICIES THAT LET UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS GET DRIVERS?? LICENSES. AND AS A U.S. SENATOR SHE SUGGESTED THAT PEOPLE WHO EAT AT RESTAURANTS THAT EMPLOY UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS ARE ARE DOING SOMETHING WRONG. ??WE HAVE TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO EMPLOYERS THAT IF YOU EMPLOY PEOPLE ILLEGALLY YOU??RE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY A PRICE? SHE TOLD A GROUP OF LONG ISLAND BUSINESSMEN IN 2006 ACCORDING TO NEWSDAY. ??I??VE HAD LOTS OF CONSTITUENTS AROUND THE STATE TELL ME HOW MUCH THEY??RE AGAINST ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. I SAY ??WELL HAVE YOU OR ANYONE YOU KNOW EVER HIRED AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR YARD OR YOUR CHILD OR HAVE YOU EVER GONE TO A RESTAURANT WHERE SOMEONE?? MIGHT BE ILLEGAL???? DURING HER FIRST TERM IN THE SENATE SHE WON PRAISE FROM RIGHT-WING COMMENTATORS FOR CRITICIZING BUSINESSES THAT HIRED UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS. ??PEOPLE HAVE TO STOP EMPLOYING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS? SHE SAID IN A 2003 RADIO INTERVIEW ACCORDING TO THE NEW YORK TIMES. ??I MEAN COME UP TO WESTCHESTER GO TO SUFFOLK AND NASSAU COUNTIES STAND ON THE STREET CORNERS IN BROOKLYN OR THE BRONX??YOU??RE GOING TO SEE LOADS OF PEOPLE WAITING TO GET PICKED UP TO GO DO YARD WORK AND CONSTRUCTION WORK AND DOMESTIC WORK.? THAT HAWKISHNESS REEMERGED IN 2014 WHEN UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT CHILDREN CROSSING THE SOUTHERN BORDER DREW NATIONAL HEADLINES. AT THE TIME SHE TOLD CNN THAT THE CHILDREN CROSSING THE BORDER SHOULD FACE DEPORTATION. ??THEY SHOULD BE SENT BACK AS SOON AS IT COULD BE DETERMINED WHO RESPONSIBLE ADULTS IN THEIR FAMILIES ARE? SHE SAID. ??THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER ALL OF THEM CAN BE SENT BACK BUT I THINK ALL OF THEM WHO CAN BE SHOULD BE REUNITED WITH THEIR FAMILIES.? CLINTON??S NEW WAY OF TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUE HAS DRAWN SOME PRAISE THOUGH IT??S TENTATIVE. ??I CAN??T IMAGINE CONDONING THE DEPORTATION OF A CHILD? SAID LYNN TRAMONTE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE PRO-IMMIGRATION REFORM GROUP AMERICA??S VOICE. ??AT THE SAME TIME WE ARE EXCITED AND ENCOURAGED THAT SHE IS CRITICIZING RAIDS.? TRAMONTE ADDED THAT SUPPORTERS OF IMMIGRATION REFORM ARE DON??T PUT TOO MUCH STOCK IN COMMENTS LIKE CLINTON??S. ??WE??RE NOT GOING TO PUT OUR FAITH IN ANY ONE POLITICIAN AND BLINDLY HOPE THAT THEY FOLLOW THROUGH ON THEIR COMMITMENTS? SHE SAID. ??WE??RE GOING TO HOLD THEM TO WHAT THEY PROMISED US.? ,8575.0
585,9907156.0,2016-01-13T20:05:00+00:00,THE GOP??S CIVIL WAR GETS EVEN MORE FUN,??VICE PRESIDENT NIKKI HALEY? BLARED THE BLUNT HEADLINE ON ERIC ERICKSON??S PAEAN TO THE SOUTH CAROLINA GOVERNOR AFTER HER TUESDAY NIGHT STATE OF THE UNION RESPONSE. ERICKSON IS NOT A DONALD-BRO TO PUT IT MILDLY SO HALEY??S OBVIOUS SWIPES THAT THE GOP FRONT-RUNNER SENT HIM OVER THE MOON. AND HE??S NOT ENTIRELY WRONG TO WRITE: ??THEN THERE WAS NIKKI HALEY. SHE HIT IT OUT OF THE PARK. IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST RESPONSES TO A STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS EVER AND THE ABSOLUTE BEST SINCE BARACK OBAMA??S ELECTION. SHE SHOWED HUMOR PASSION AND A WILLINGNESS TO HOLD THE PRESIDENT ACCOUNTABLE. SHE WENT SO FAR AS TO ADMIT REPUBLICANS HAD TO SHARE BLAME WITH THE PRESIDENT BUT PRESENTED HOW THE GOP WOULD FIX PROBLEMS IT HELPED CREATE.? THEN THERE WERE THOSE WHO UH DISAGREED. MOST FAMOUS OF COURSE WAS ANN COULTER??S TWEET ABOUT HOW PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOULD DEPORT HER. A BREITBART.COM ARTICLE NOTED GRUMPILY THAT THE REPUBLICANS SEEMED TO BE USING THEIR LITTLE MOMENT IN THE SOTU SUN TO BE BASHING REPUBLICANS??AND NOT JUST THE FRONTRUNNER BUT RANK-AND-FILE VOTERS TOO: ??ACCORDING TO RASMUSSEN 65% OF CONSERVATIVE VOTERS SAY THE UNITED STATES SHOULD NOT LET IN ANY REFUGEES FROM THE ENTIRE MIDDLE EAST?? THE POINT OF VIEW REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP IS PRESUMABLY ATTACKING WITH ITS STATE OF THE UNION REBUTTAL.? AND THERE??S MORE: WE HAVE LAURA INGRAHAM WHO TOOK THE DAN-SNYDER-ESQUE ALL CAPS APPROACH (??NOT SMART?) AND BREITBART COLUMNIST JOHN NOLTE WHO TWEETED: ??TO THE GLEE OF OUR CORRUPT MEDIA NIKKI HALEY IS ATTACKING OUR OWN FRONTRUNNER. THE GOP ESTABLISHMENT IS GARBAGE.? THIS IS JUST FIVE KINDS OF AWESOME ISN??T IT? IT??S YET MORE PROOF THAT THE GOP COULD ACTUALLY BREAK IN TWO WHICH WILL OPEN THE DOOR TO HALEY??S DEFENDERS DESPERATE TO BEAT BACK NOMINEE TRUMP RUSHING TO SOMEONE LIKE??WELL LIKE WHO IS THE PROBLEM BUT THEY??LL BE DESPERATE ENOUGH TO FIND SOMEBODY. NOW FROM WHAT I CAN SEE??AND I ADMIT I CAN ONLY READ SO MUCH OF THIS STUFF??ERICKSON SEEMS TO REPRESENT THE MAJORITY VIEW ON WHAT WE MIGHT CALL THE BROAD RIGHT. AND HALEY OBVIOUSLY DID DO A FINE JOB LAST NIGHT AND SHE??D BE AS PLAUSIBLE A VICE-PRESIDENTIAL CHOICE AS A LOT OF PEOPLE ESPECIALLY ASSUMING THE DEMOCRATS STICK WITH HILLARY CLINTON. BUT NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT FOR WHICH OF THE GOP CANDIDATES WOULD IT MAKE SENSE TO PLUCK HALEY? THEIR BIRTHER BATTLE ASIDE CRUZ STILL WANTS TRUMP??S VOTERS IF THE DONALD COLLAPSES SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY WHICH MEANS IT??S NOT AN OBVIOUS CHOICE FOR HIM. MARCO RUBIO? SO THE GOP TICKET WOULD THEN HAVE TWO NONWHITE CANDIDATES. AND TWO SOUTHERNERS BUT IT??S THE TWO NONWHITES THAT SEEMS PROBLEMATIC TO ME AND NO I??M NOT SAYING THAT BECAUSE I THINK CONSERVATIVES ARE A BUNCH OF RACISTS I??M SAYING IT BECAUSE 70 PERCENT OF THE GENERAL-ELECTION ELECTORATE IS STILL WHITE. SO THE ONLY REMOTELY PLAUSIBLE CANDIDATE (JEB! IS NO LONGER THIS) WHO MIGHT CHOOSE HALEY IT SEEMS TO ME IS CHRIS CHRISTIE CURRENTLY TRADING AT THE LONG ODDS YOU??D EXPECT. BUT WHAT??S MOST INTERESTING HERE IS THE HALEY NARRATIVE OVER THE YEARS AND THE USES TO WHICH CONSERVATIVES HAVE PUT HER AS NEEDED. SHE BURST ON THE SCENE YOU??LL RECALL IN 2010. SHE WAS BEHIND AND KIND OF A ??WHO?? AND WAS GOING TO LOSE TO GRESHAM BARRETT A CONGRESSMAN AND CITADEL GRAD AND EVERYTHING A SOUTH CAROLINA REPUBLICAN GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE WHEN BAM SARAH PALIN ENDORSED HALEY AND EVERYTHING FLIPPED OVERNIGHT. BARRETT LEFT THE RACE SOMETHING OF A BROKEN MAN WHICH I CHRONICLED BACK IN 2012. SUDDENLY POST-PALIN IT WAS: NEW FACE OF THE GOP! A SIKH OF ALL INTERESTING THINGS! IT HELPED THAT MOST AMERICANS COULDN??T TELL YOU ONE THING ABOUT WHAT A SIKH WAS JUST AS LONG AS IT WASN??T ARAB. BUT YES SHE??S BROWN??BUT SHE??S CONSERVATIVE SO SHE??S ONE OF OURS! THEN SHE ACTUALLY BECAME GOVERNOR (ALTHOUGH NOT BY MUCH??JUST FOUR POINTS IN A HEAVILY REPUBLICAN STATE). THERE WERE GLOWING PROFILES FOR A LITTLE WHILE THEN A FAIRLY MAJOR CORRUPTION SCANDAL THAT NOBODY REMEMBERS A THING ABOUT ANYMORE INVOLVING CHARGES THAT HALEY SCREWED OVER THE PORT OF CHARLESTON IN FAVOR OF THE PORT OF SAVANNAH (IN NEIGHBORING GEORGIA) BECAUSE SOME CRONY-DONORS OF HER STOOD TO BENEFIT DOWN IN SAVANNAH. SPECIFICALLY SHE RAISED $15000 AT A GEORGIA FUND-RAISER JUST DAYS BEFORE HER GOVERNMENT LENT ITS APPROVAL TO THE DREDGING OF THE SAVANNAH HARBOR. FOR MUCH OF HER FIRST TERM HER APPROVAL RATING WAS IN THE 30S. BUT SHE WEATHERED IT AND WON REELECTION HANDILY. AND SHE HAS GOVERNED QUITE CONSERVATIVELY. HERE??S HER IDEOLOGY SCORE AS DETERMINED BY A SITE CALLED INSIDEGOV.COM. SHE??S TO THE RIGHT OF NEW MEXICO??S SUSANA MARTINEZ AND FLORIDA??S RICK SCOTT AND RIGHT UP THERE WITH ALABAMA??S ROBERT BENTLEY. AND SHE??S WELL TO THE RIGHT OF CHRIS CHRISTIE (JUST GO TO INSIDEGOV AND PLUG IN ALL THEIR NAMES AND YOU??LL SEE). PLUS SHE DID THE NORMAL REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR THING OF SCREWING 340000 CONSTITUENTS OUT OF HEALTH COVERAGE BY REFUSING TO ACCEPT THE MEDICAID EXPANSION. SO EVERYTHING WAS BASICALLY FINE WITH HER ON THE RIGHT AND THEN THE CHARLESTON CHURCH SHOOTING HAPPENED. HERE FATE GRABBED HER BY THE LAPELS. AND YES SHE DID DO THE RIGHT THING WHEN SHE ORDERED THE CONFEDERATE FLAG REMOVED FROM THE STATE CAPITOL GROUNDS. SHE EVEN SAID IT NEVER SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE. SHE HAD A LITTLE SUPPORT ON THE RIGHT FOR THAT ONE ESPECIALLY UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES WITH THE BLOOD OF THOSE SLAIN AFRICAN AMERICANS STILL SPATTERED ON THE WALLS OF A HISTORIC CHURCH. BUT THERE WAS ALSO TONS OF BLOWBACK. ??IS THE AMERICAN FLAG NEXT?? BAYED ONE FOX NINCOMPOOP. SAID RUSH LIMBAUGH: ??IT??S NOT GOING TO STOP WITH THE CONFEDERATE FLAG BECAUSE IT??S NOT ABOUT THE CONFEDERATE FLAG. IT IS ABOUT DESTROYING THE SOUTH AS A POLITICAL FORCE. IT??S ABOUT ISOLATING TARGETING AND IDENTIFYING THE?ŸSOUTH AS DYLANN ROOF.? WE HAVE YET TO HEAR FROM PALIN ON HALEY??S SOTU RESPONSE. SHE??S IN A BIT OF A PICKLE OR WOULD BE IF ANYONE ACTUALLY CARED ANYMORE WHAT SHE THOUGHT. BUT SHE??S SPOKEN NICEY-NICEY ABOUT TRUMP IN RECENT MONTHS. NOW SHE HAS HALEY WHOM SHE HELPED CREATE ATTACKING HIM. WHERE DOES SHE GO? COME TO THINK OF IT WHAT PALIN SAYS ON THIS ONE MAY IN FACT BE INSTRUCTIVE. AND THE FACT THAT WHAT SARAH PALIN SAYS IS INDICATIVE OF ANYTHING SAYS EXACTLY WHAT NEEDS TO BE SAID ABOUT THE STATE OF THE GOP. ,49810.0

THE STORY BEGAN WITH A NOSTALGIC DESCRIPTION OF THE TOWN WHERE I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL FULL OF THE PROMISE OF A ROMANTIC TEENAGE CRUSH THAT WOULD HOPEFULLY LEAD TO A HAPPILY-EVER-AFTER ENDING. BUT INSTEAD IT REPEATED A STORY WE ALL KNOW TOO WELL. BOY LIKES GIRL GIRL DOESN??T KNOW HE EXISTS??IN OTHER WORDS CHARLIE BROWN AND THE ELUSIVE LITTLE RED HAIRED GIRL. BUT UNLIKE CHARLIE BROWN THE MAN IN THE STORY NEVER MUSTERS THE COURAGE TO SPEAK TO HIS CRUSH AS A BOY AND EVEN WHEN GIVEN A SECOND CHANCE AS A YOUNG MAN FAILS TO SPEAK HIS TRUTH. HE WON??T GAIN THE COURAGE TO TELL HER HOW HE FEELS ABOUT HER UNTIL HE ANONYMOUSLY SHARES HIS STORY WITH TWO WRITERS FOR AN ONLINE MAGAZINE TWENTY YEARS LATER. SINCE I??M THE FEATURED OBJECT OF HIS AFFECTION I ASSUMED IT WAS ONLY FAIR THAT I RESPOND. HERE??S MY TAKE ON THEIR STORY. FEEL FREE TO CRITICIZE ON TWITTER. WE ALL WANT TO BELIEVE IN LOVE. WE WANT THE POOR LOVE-SICK BOY TO WIN OVER THE POPULAR GIRL IN HIGH SCHOOL MARRY HER HAVE CHILDREN AND GROW OLD WITH HER. WE WANT TO HEAR THE STORY OF A BOY WHO HAD A CRUSH AND WHO WAS REUNITED WITH HER 20 YEARS LATER TO FIND THAT SHE TOO WAS IN LOVE WITH HIM. THAT THEY WOULD FIND THEMSELVES IN A PLACE IN THEIR LIVES WHEN THEIR WORLDS MAGICALLY COLLIDE AND FATE TAKES ITS COURSE. BUT THEN THERE??S THE SIDE OF US??AND THIS IS THE ATTITUDE THAT HANGS OVER THE PIECE??WHICH WANTS TO HEAR THAT HIS MUSE HIS ??BEAUTIFUL ASIAN WOMAN? NEVER FELT LOVED DIDN??T KNOW HER WORTH AND BECAME A STRIPPER. AND WHEN SHE SEES HIM IN THE CLUB DURING HER HALF-NAKED ROUNDS IN SEARCH OF LAP DANCES THAT SHE IS REMINDED OF THE GIRL SHE ONCE WAS REALIZES SHE IS ??BROKEN? AND RUNS OFF NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN. IF HE HAD SPOKEN TO HER THAT DAY ON THE STREET HE MAY HAVE BEEN SURPRISED TO FIND OUT THAT SHE DIDN??T HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS A CHEERLEADER. THAT SHE WASN??T OUT OF HIS REACH FOR CONVERSATION AND FRIENDSHIP AND MAYBE EVEN LOVE. SHE MAY HAVE ACCEPTED AN OFFER OF A DATE AND GONE OUT WITH HIM. THEY MAY NOT HAVE BEEN COMPATIBLE SHE WOULD HAVE MOST LIKELY STILL MOVED AWAY FROM THE SMALL TOWN WHERE SHE WENT TO SCHOOL BUT THEN HE WOULD NEVER HAVE TO WONDER FOR DECADES WHAT IF. I CAN??T RECALL WHO KJ IS BUT I DO VAGUELY REMEMBER SAYING SOMETHING TO A BOY WORKING ON HIS CAR WHILE WALKING HOME FROM SCHOOL. THERE WERE ALSO A FEW GUYS WHO CAME INTO THE STRIP CLUB WHERE I WORKED YEARS LATER THAT I HAD GONE TO SCHOOL WITH SO THAT PART OF HIS STORY COULD ALSO BE TRUE. BUT THE SUGGESTION THAT WOMEN CHOOSE TO STRIP BECAUSE THEY ARE BROKEN DON??T KNOW THEIR WORTH OR LACK SELF-ESTEEM ISN??T ENTIRELY CORRECT. I USED TO BE ENRAGED WHEN MEN WOULD TELL ME I WAS ??TOO PRETTY? OR ??TOO SMART? TO BE A STRIPPER. I REMEMBER DEBATING WITH CUSTOMERS ABOUT MY CHOICE TO BE IN A JOB WHERE I TOOK MY CLOTHES OFF FOR MONEY. WHAT THESE MEN DIDN??T KNOW ABOUT ME WAS THAT I HAD ALREADY WORKED THREE JOBS AT A TIME TO PAY THE BILLS ONE OF WHICH INCLUDED DAILY SEXUAL HARASSMENT THAT THE MANAGEMENT WOULD NEVER ADDRESS. I HAD PASSED THE REAL ESTATE EXAM AT 18 TAKEN ON MY FIRST BUSINESS AND BEEN MARRIED AT 19 AND BY THE AGE OF 21 WAS RELIEVED TO FINALLY HAVE A JOB THAT I LOVED THAT PAID ME SOMETHING CLOSE TO THE TRUE VALUE OF MY TIME. THIS JOB ACTUALLY ENABLED ME TO PUT MYSELF THROUGH COLLEGE THOUGH I WOULD ONLY COMPLETE ONE SEMESTER. I DIDN??T END UP AS A STRIPPER I CHOSE TO BE ONE. IF I DID RUN OUT THE BACK DOOR OF THE CLUB THAT NIGHT IT MAY HAVE BEEN BECAUSE I DIDN??T WANT TO BE AT WORK. SOME NIGHTS GOING INTO THE CLUB AND GOING ON-STAGE WERE NECESSARY FOR ME. I NEEDED THE ATTENTION AND THRIVED ON THE GENEROUS ALBEIT FALSE ADORATION. WHILE I HAD A FEW ADMIRERS IN SCHOOL I WASN??T ONE OF THE ??PRETTY? GIRLS. GUYS WANTED TO DATE ME BUT NOBODY REALLY TOLD ME I WAS BEAUTIFUL. MOST OF MY CLOTHES CAME FROM KMART AND WE COULDN??T AFFORD DESIGNER SHOES. I WAS GRATEFUL ON THE DAYS I GOT TO WEAR MY CHEER UNIFORM SO THAT I COULD FINALLY BE LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE??EXCEPT I KNEW I WASN??T LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. WHAT I DIDN??T REALIZE WAS THAT THE VERY THING THAT MADE ME DIFFERENT WAS ALSO WHAT MADE ME BEAUTIFUL. IT TOOK THREE MONTHS OF WORKING IN A FULL NUDE BAR TO GROW INTO THE WOMAN THAT I WOULD BECOME. A WOMAN WHO WAS DRIVEN WHO WANTED EVERYTHING THIS LIFE HAD TO OFFER WHO NO LONGER CARED TO FIT IN WITH EVERYONE ELSE BUT INSTEAD HAD A LONGING TO BE WHO SHE WAS. IT WAS THERE ON THAT DARK SMOKE-FILLED STAGE THAT SHE GAINED THE COURAGE TO BE HERSELF NIGHT AFTER NIGHT. I ENJOYED THE PERFORMANCE ASPECT OF MY WORK AND I LIKED BEING ABLE TO BE SEXY TO FEEL DESIRED BUT ON MY TERMS. I HAD THE CHANCE TO EXPLORE MY FEMININITY MY SEXUALITY AND MY PERSONA WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE. I FOUND MYSELF IN THE PAIR OF THIGH HIGH PATENT LEATHER BOOTS THAT CLIMBED THEIR WAY ONTO THE POLES AND INTO MY SOUL. I LET GO OF THE STRAIGHT A SELF-CONSCIOUS OVER-ACHIEVER THAT I WAS AND LET THE ANGRY PASSIONATE DANGEROUS SIDE OF MY PERSONALITY EXPLORE. MY SELF-CONFIDENCE SOARED EVERY NIGHT I BECAME MY ALTER-EGO. BUT THERE WERE ALSO NIGHTS THAT I WAS VULNERABLE. I JUST NEEDED TO BE HOME TO BE IN SOLITUDE TO BE QUIET AND GENTLE WITH MYSELF. I??M GUESSING THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE CASE THE NIGHT KJ CAME INTO THE CLUB. WE MAY HAVE EXCHANGED WORDS ABOUT HIM BEING FROM HESPERIA. I MAY HAVE NOT WANTED TO MAKE SMALL TALK THAT NIGHT. I MAY HAVE FELT EXHAUSTED AT THE PROSPECT OF HAVING TO PULL WORDS OUT OF THIS SHY MAN??S MOUTH IN ORDER TO EVENTUALLY GET A LAP DANCE OUT OF THE ENCOUNTER. I MAY HAVE JUST DECIDED TO LEAVE WORK THAT NIGHT OR I MAY HAVE BEEN GETTING OFF FROM AN EARLIER SHIFT. HAD KJ TOLD ME THAT HE USED TO HAVE A CRUSH ON ME I MAY HAVE STAYED AND TALKED TO HIM. IT WASN??T ALL ABOUT THE MONEY. I GOT JUST AS MUCH OUT OF BEING IN THE CLUB AS MANY OF THE MEN WHO VISITED. I GOT TO BE THE OBJECT OF SOMEONE??S AFFECTION JUST AS MUCH AS THEY WERE THE OBJECT OF MINE. IT DIDN??T MATTER IF THERE WAS A MONETARY EXCHANGE FOR THE TRANSACTION. BOTH PARTIES WERE ADULT HUMAN BEINGS WITH THE NEED TO FEEL SEEN FEEL DESIRED MAYBE EVEN FEEL LOVED. HAD KJ UNDERSTOOD THIS PART OF STRIP CLUB CULTURE HE MIGHT HAVE FINALLY HAD THE COURAGE TO SPEND MORE THAN JUST A FLEETING MOMENT WITH MIYOKO FUJIMORI. BEING PRESENT SPEAKING OUR TRUTH SHARING OUR NEEDS AND DESIRES WITH THOSE AROUND US ISN??T ALWAYS ENCOURAGED. WE CONSTANTLY PLAY GAMES PRETEND TO BE PEOPLE THAT WE AREN??T WORRY ABOUT WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK OF US AND ULTIMATELY LIVE OUR LIVES AS A SLIGHT REPRESENTATION OF WHO WE REALLY ARE. SO TO KJ AND EVERY OTHER PERSON WHO HAS A SIMILAR STORY ABOUT THE ONE WHO GOT AWAY??WHY NOT INSTEAD DECIDE TO TAKE RISKS BE UNCOMFORTABLE FOR A MOMENT TRY SOMETHING NEW DO SOMETHING THAT SCARES YOU? TALK TO THE LITTLE RED-HAIRED GIRL. THE ONLY THING YOU HAVE TO LOSE IS A LIFETIME OF WONDERING WHAT IF. ,31312.0

PHOTOS: DAVID BOWIE FASHION ICON BEFORE BOWIE BEING A MAN EVEN A FAMOUS MAN MEANT DRESSING ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF TRADITIONAL MASCULINITY. HIPPIE-ERA MEN MAY HAVE GROWN THEIR HAIR LONG AND WORN TIE-DYE AND LOON PANTS BUT IT WAS BOWIE WHO WORE HIS HAIR LONG TO BLUR THE BOUNDARIES OF GENDER ITSELF WHO WORE MAKEUP TO DO EXACTLY THE SAME. HIS INCARNATION OF ZIGGY STARDUST WAS A LIBERATING SIREN WHICH BLARED THROUGH THE LIVING ROOMS OF STAID BUTTONED-UP BRITAIN IN THE 1970S. SUDDENLY BEING A MAN COULD MEAN DRESS-UP TOO. SUDDENLY ??BEING A MAN? SEEMED VERY DIFFERENT. SEXUALITY COULD BE FLUID NOT FIXED. THE TABLOID TERM ??GENDER-BENDER? OFFENSIVE AS IT WAS MEANT BACK THEN WAS MADE FOR BOWIE??AND HE LOVED PLAYING UP TO IT UNAPOLOGETICALLY. IT WASN??T JUST DRESSING UP AS ZIGGY ALTHOUGH THAT IS THE TOUCHSTONE MANY REMEMBER. SEE THE ASTONISHING BODYSUIT KANSAI YAMAMOTO DESIGNED FOR HIM IN 1973 FOR BOWIE??S ??ALADDIN SANE? TOUR FOR EXAMPLE. YAMAMOTO TOLD ELLE IN 2013 THAT IT WAS DESIGNED FOR A WOMAN BUT LOOK??IN 1973??LONG BEFORE THE WORLD??S NOTION OF WHAT MEN AND WOMEN CAN WEAR TODAY HOW RADICAL AND STUNNING BOWIE LOOKS AND HOW HE OWNS THAT LOOK WITH PANACHE AND DARING. THE LOOK REMAINS REVOLUTIONARY TODAY. LIFE WAS GLORIOUS UNASHAMED PERFORMANCE TO BOWIE. AFTER ZIGGY AND SANE CAME THE THIN WHITE DUKE AND COLLABORATIONS WITH DESIGNERS INCLUDING THIERRY MUGLER HEDI SLIMANE AND ALEXANDER MCQUEEN. BOWIE??S LOOKS MIRRORED HIS INNOVATIONS AS AN ARTIST: HE WAS RESTLESS AND UNCLASSIFIABLE. HE COULD SING POP GLAM ROCK SOUL. HE COULD ACT. HE WAS A STYLE ICON IF HE WAS IN STACKED HEELS AND SILVER JUMPSUIT AND HE WAS A STYLE ICON WHEN HE WAS IN THE SHARPER SUITS AND T-SHIRTS AND CHINOS HE SEGUED TO IN THE 1980S. HE WAS LITHE AND SEXY. HE STRUTTED. HE EMOTED. HE LOVED ART AND CARED ABOUT ART AND LIVED A RESTLESS ARTIST??S LIFE NO MATTER HOW SUCCESSFUL AND RICH HE BECAME. HIS IMPULSE WAS TO INNOVATE LONG AFTER HE COULD HAVE RESTED ON THE GLORIES OF THE PAST. BOWIE WAS BEAUTIFUL CLASSICALLY SO THOSE CHEEKBONES WERE SHEER. LATER CAME THE SKINNY SUITS THE SKINNY JEANS THE ORANGE SPIKY HAIR TRANSITIONED TO A LUXURIANT BLOND QUIFF AND??MOST RECENTLY??A SIMPLE CROP AND THAT FACE NOW IN ITS LATE ??60S WHEN LAST PHOTOGRAPHED IN MID-DECEMBER WAS STILL BEAUTIFUL IMPISH AND SEXY EVEN IF BY THEN BOWIE HIMSELF WAS VERY ILL. IF THE TRUE TEST OF A CELEBRITY??S SIGNIFICANCE IS HIS OR LONGEVITY OR CULTURAL IMPACT THEN BOWIE HAS FEW RIVALS. WE SEE HIM IN OUR MIND??S EYE BEFORE WE HEAR HIS VOICE. HE IS A LIGHTNING CONDUCTOR AN ORIGINAL A REVOLUTIONARY AND RENEGADE??WITH HIS IMPORTANCE MEASURED IN THE INTENSELY PERSONAL EXPERIENCES OF THOSE WHO FELT ZIGGY BLAZE A TRAIL THROUGH THE 1970S AND IN HOW HE HELPED CHANGE AND CHALLENGE THE STRICTURES OF GENDER AND FASHION. BOWIE ALSO REMAINED FUNDAMENTALLY AN ENIGMA??THE BEST KIND. HE WAS A RECLUSE BUT NOT A HERMIT. HE USED THE MULTIMEDIA AGE FOR HIS OWN ENDS AND WAS NEVER INTRUDED UPON BY IT. HE LET HIS IMAGE AND SONGS DO THE TALKING FOR HIM. FOR A COMPENDIUM OF HIM AND WHAT HE MEANT THE THEATRICAL EXPERIENCE OF LAZARUS AT THE NEW YORK THEATER WORKSHOP THE LAST MAJOR WORK HE WAS INVOLVED IN (AS WELL AS THE ALBUM OF THE SAME TITLE) PROVIDES A MOVING MEANINGFUL SNAPSHOT. NOW THERE IS ALSO THE VIDEO TO ??LAZARUS?? THE SONG WHICH FEATURES IN THE STAGE SHOW AS WELL AS THE 10-MINUTE ??BLACKSTAR? A FANTASIA OF JAZZ HIP-HOP AND POP AND ODDNESS THE TITLE TRACK FROM HIS MOST RECENT ALBUM. IN ??BLACKSTAR? HE MAY LOOK HIS AGE AND WITH THAT AGE THE BEAUTY THE STYLE AND MYSTERY REMAIN INTACT. ON STAGE AT THE NYTW YOU WILL SEE THE SPACEMAN YOU??LL SEE THE OLDER MAN YOUNGER MAN A MAN IN LOVE AND A MAN LOST. YOU??LL SEE BOUNDARIES OF TIME AND SPACE AND SEXUALITY ALL BLEND AND BLUR. YOU??LL FIND A MEDITATION ON LOVE LOSS DEATH CONNECTION AND DISCONNECTION. AND YOU??LL FIND AN ARTIST WHO ULTIMATELY SURVIVES AND ENDURES. AS YOU WATCH IT??PERHAPS BAFFLED AS MANY HAVE BEEN??YOU WILL ALSO BE BEWITCHED SEDUCED AND CHARMED. YOU??LL FEEL ALL THOSE THINGS??THE BEST MOST ENRICHING KIND OF SENSORY CONFUSION AND CLASH??THAT BOWIE HIMSELF MADE US FEEL. ,5710.0

THAT YEAR A LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY??S OFFICE FOUND THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO PROSECUTE CHOUDHURY. BUT ON MONDAY CHOUDHURY WAS ORDERED TO PAY $924500 IN COMPENSATORY DAMAGES TO A LAWYER WHO ALLEGED CHOUDHURY FIRED HER IN 2013 WHEN HE DISCOVERED SHE WAS INVESTIGATING SEVERAL OF THESE SEXUAL ASSAULT ALLEGATIONS. A LOS ANGELES JURY SIDED WITH THE ATTORNEY MINAKSHI JAFA-BODDEN WHO CLAIMED SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND WRONGFUL TERMINATION IN HER SUIT. THE JURY CONTINUED DELIBERATING ON TUESDAY ABOUT WHETHER JAFA-BODDEN SHOULD ALSO BE AWARDED PUNITIVE DAMAGES. ??THE CASE IS STILL CONTINUING SO I AM A BIT RELUCTANT TO SPEAK ABOUT IT OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE LADIES AND GENTLEMAN OF THE JURY? CHOUDHURY??S LAWYER ROBERT TAFOYA TOLD THE DAILY BEAST IN AN EMAIL. ??HOWEVER I WILL TELL YOU THAT MR. CHOUDHURY WILL BE APPEALING THE VERDICT BASED ON WHAT WE CURRENTLY KNOW AND THE VERDICT AS IT CURRENTLY STANDS.? HE ADDED THAT CHOUDHURY IS ALSO CONSIDERING A MOTION TO HAVE THE JUDGE DISMISS THE VERDICT AND ANOTHER POSSIBLE MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL. CHOUDHURY 69 HAS LONG HAD A REPUTATION FOR LEWDNESS AND MISOGYNY. IN A 1977 TABLOID INTERVIEW HE REPORTEDLY SAID THAT ACTRESS RAQUEL WELCH THEN HIS STUDENT ??HAS COTTAGE CHEESE MUSCLES FAT LEGS AND A STIFF BODY.? FIVE YEARS AGO DETAILS PUBLISHED A FEATURE DETAILING THE SEXUALLY CHARGED ATMOSPHERE AT ONE OF BIKRAM??S INTENSIVE NINE-WEEK TEACHER TRAININGS IN SAN DIEGO??A $10900 INVESTMENT FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO BECOME CERTIFIED BIKRAM YOGA INSTRUCTORS. (OTHER TRAININGS HAVE BEEN MORE OR LESS EXPENSIVE DEPENDING ON THE LOCATION). BIKRAM COMES ACROSS AS A NARCISSISTIC DESPOT RATHER THAN A GROUNDED YOGI PARADING AROUND IN A BLACK SPEEDO AND SHOUTING VULGAR DEGRADING INSTRUCTIONS AT HIS STUDENTS: ??YOU MISS TEENY-WEENY BIKINI! SPREAD YOUR LEGS! YOU MR. MASTURBATION! UNTIL I SAY ??CHANGE?? YOU DO NOT MOVE A MUSCLE!? IF PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS KNEW THAT THE REVERED YOGA MASTER ROUTINELY MADE CRUDE REMARKS SUCH AS ??THIS POSTURE CALLED DIRTY OLD BITCH! BECAUSE NOT EVEN ONE MORE INCH CAN YOU STRETCH!? MANY WOULD LIKELY BE DETERRED. DETAILS REPORTED THAT BIKRAM??S FEMALE STUDENTS WERE MORE TOLERANT OF HIS ABSURD SHOWMANSHIP AND BULLYING STYLE THAN HIS MALE STUDENTS. BUT THEY ALL STUCK AROUND TO MASTER HIS PUNISHING 90-MINUTE SEQUENCE OF 26 POSTURES PERFORMED IN ROOMS HEATED TO MORE THAN 100 DEGREES. BIKRAM??S BUSINESS MODEL WAS ALSO ABOUT MAKING YOGA SEXY: HOT AND SWEATY STUDENTS PRACTICING HALF-NAKED AND IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO EACH OTHER WHILE THEIR GURU PREACHED FREE LOVE. HE CLAIMED HE DISCOURAGED ROMANTIC ENCOUNTERS DURING TEACHER TRAININGS: ??I TELL THEM ALL ??NO TOUCHY-TOUCHY NO KISSY-KISSY NO FUCKY-FUCKY!?? ?? BUT THE SEXUAL ATMOSPHERE AND GRUELLING WORKOUT WERE IRRESISTIBLE. BY 2010 BIKRAM WAS EARNING AN ESTIMATED $5 MILLION A YEAR. HE ALSO HAD A CELEBRITY FOLLOWING THAT INCLUDED MADONNA ASHTON KUTCHER DEMI MOORE LADY GAGA GEORGE CLOONEY JENNIFER ANISTON AND KOBE BRYANT. THEN CAME THE ACCUSATIONS OF RAPE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT. THE FIRST COMPLAINT WAS FILED IN 2013 BY A FORMER STUDENT SARAH BAUGHN WHO ALLEGED THAT CHOUDHURY BEGAN SEXUALLY PURSUING HER AT A 2005 TEACHER TRAINING (SHE WAS 20 AT THE TIME) WHISPERING SEXUAL INNUENDOS IN HER EAR WHILE ASSISTING HER WITH POSES. SHE CONTINUED TO STUDY WITH HIM AND AGREED TO ASSIST AT A 2007 TEACHER TRAINING IN HAWAII BECAUSE SHE BELIEVED HE HAD ANOTHER MISTRESS AT THE TIME (VANITY FAIR TOLD HER STORY IN A 2014 EXPOS?? ON BIKRAM.) LATER THAT YEAR HE ALLEGEDLY ASSAULTED HER AT HIS HOME AFTER HIS WIFE HAD GONE TO SLEEP. ACCORDING TO BAUGHN??S SUIT SHE FROZE WHEN HE SUDDENLY ??EMBRACED HER FROM BEHIND AND PRESSED HIS PENIS INTO HER LEG.? HE SAID HE WAS LONELY THAT HIS WIFE WAS A ??BITCH? AND THAT HE NEEDED ??SOMEONE TO TAKE CARE OF ME SO I DON??T DIE.? WHEN SHE REBUFFED HIS ADVANCES ACCORDING TO HER SUIT BIKRAM THREATENED HER: ??YOU WILL NEVER BE CHAMPION WITHOUT ME.? THE MORE SHE REJECTED HIM THE MORE HE MADE SURE ON THIS THREAT. SPEAKING TO THE NEW YORK TIMES IN 2013 BAUGHN??S LAWYER DECLINED TO SAY WHETHER HER CLIENT REPORTED THE ASSAULTS TO POLICE. BUT ANOTHER PLAINTIFF JANE DOE 1 REPORTED HER RAPES THREE WEEKS AFTER BAUGHN FILED SUIT. THAT SAME YEAR LARISSA ANDERSON CLAIMED HE RAPED HER AT HIS HOME WHILE HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN WERE SLEEPING UPSTAIRS (??SHE FELT SICK TO HER STOMACH BUT TOO SCARED OF BIKRAM TO SAY ANYTHING? THE SUIT READS. ??HE WAS TOO POWERFUL TO GO AGAINST.? A WOMAN REFERRED TO AS JANE DOE 2 IN HER MAY 2013 SUIT SAID SHE WAS ASSAULTED AT A 2010 TEACHER TRAINING. A 2015 COMPLAINT FILED BY A WOMAN NAMED JILL LAWLER CLAIMED CHOUDHURY RAPED HER AT A 2010 TEACHER TRAINING AND ON SEVERAL OTHER OCCASIONS. SHE DID NOT SPEAK OUT THE SUIT SAYS BECAUSE SHE WAS AFRAID THAT CHOUDHURY WOULD ??KICK HER OUT OF TRAINING AND SHE WOULD HAVE LOST BOTH THE $10000 FROM HER COLLEGE FUND AND HER ABILITY TO WORK AS A YOGA INSTRUCTOR IN ORDER TO PAY FOR THE COLLEGE.? A JURY TRIAL IS SCHEDULED TO BEGIN IN AUGUST. WHILE SOME STUDIOS DISASSOCIATED FROM BIKRAM??S NAME AS THE SEXUAL MISCONDUCT SUITS PILED UP MANY MORE STUDIOS BRANDED BY THE HOT YOGA PIONEER HAVE CONTINUED TO OPEN. AS FOR WHETHER THE NEW CASE WILL AFFECT HIS EMPIRE CHOUDHURY??S LAWYER SAID BIKRAM ??WILL CONTINUE TO CARRY ON HIS YOGA BUSINESS.? ??VERY FEW PEOPLE MAKE A LOT OF MONEY IN THIS BUSINESS AND HE HAS MADE MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE IN YOGA? SAID ROHIT DESHPANDE PROFESSOR OF MARKETING AT HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL WHO DID A CASE STUDY THERE TITLED ??BRANDING YOGA?. ??IRONICALLY HE DID IT BY CLAIMING HE??S DEVELOPED THIS UNIQUE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND THEN DEFENDING HIMSELF TO WHAT HE THINKS OF AS ATTEMPTS TO STEAL HIS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY? SAID DESHPANDE. INDEED CHOUDHURY LOST AN APPEAL TO COPYRIGHT HIS 26 POSES AND TWO BREATHING EXERCISES IN OCTOBER WHEN A FEDERAL COURT RULED THAT THE SEQUENCE IN HOT YOGA CLASSES POPULARIZED BY BIKRAM ARE NOT PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT LAW \BECAUSE COPYRIGHT PROTECTION IS LIMITED TO THE&NBSPEXPRESSION OF IDEAS AND DOES NOT EXTEND TO THE IDEAS THEMSELVES.\"" DESHPANDE STUDIES THE PROS AND CONS OF ATTACHING YOUR NAME TO A BRAND AND REFERENCES MARTHA STEWART AS AN EXAMPLE OF A BRAND THAT SUFFERED AFTER SHE WAS CONVICTED OF INSIDER TRADING. ??HER STOCK PLUMMETED AND IT TOOK A LONG TIME FOR HER TO BE RESURRECTED.

IT??S THE MIDDLE EAST POLICY EQUIVALENT OF A COEXIST BUMPER STICKER. SANDERS?? PROPOSAL MIGHT SOUND PROMISING TO FOREIGN POLICY LIGHTWEIGHT??BUT THOSE WITH EXPERTISE IN THE AREA KNOW THAT THE CONCEPT IS DEEPLY TROUBLING. ??THESE COMMENTS INDICATE SANDERS LACK OF SERIOUS ENGAGEMENT WITH FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES. WHILE I APPRECIATE HIS OPPOSITION TO THE IRAQ WAR PERHAPS IF HE WAS A LITTLE MORE ENGAGED WITH THAT ISSUE HE WOULD UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEMATIC ELEMENTS [OF HIS PROPOSAL]? SAID EVAN BARRETT A POLITICAL ADVISER TO THE COALITION FOR A DEMOCRATIC SYRIA A SYRIAN-AMERICAN OPPOSITION UMBRELLA GROUP. SANDERS HAS PREFERRED TO STICK TO ECONOMIC ISSUES AN ENVIRONMENT THAT HE IS DEEPLY FAMILIAR WITH. BUT HE HAS BEEN APPARENTLY UNPREPARED TO ADDRESS NATIONAL SECURITY TOPICS A PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF POSITION HE IS SEEKING. HIS PUZZLING COMMENTS ON HOW TO FIGHT ISIS ARE JUST THE LATEST MANIFESTATION OF HIS LACK OF FOREIGN POLICY FUNDAMENTALS. RUNNING AGAINST FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY CLINTON SANDERS WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE ON THE DEFENSIVE WHEN IT CAME TO FOREIGN POLICY EXPERTISE. BUT THE VERMONT SENATOR ISN??T DOING HIMSELF ANY FAVORS WHEN HE CONSISTENTLY ARGUES FOR A LEADING STATE SPONSOR OF TERRORISM TO TEAM UP WITH ITS MORTAL ADVERSARY TO FIGHT ISIS AN EXTREMIST GROUP WHICH IRAN??S OWN ACTIONS ARE EMPOWERING. SANDERS HAS REPEATEDLY SAID THE UNITED STATES SHOULD NOT TAKE THE LEAD IN THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS. BUT THE UNSERIOUS PART OF HIS PROPOSAL IS THE SUGGESTION THAT HE SUGGESTS SAUDI ARABIA AND IRAN SHOULD WORK TOGETHER TO FIGHT ISLAMIC EXTREMISM??SEEMINGLY OBLIVIOUS TO THE SCHISMS IN THE REGION. ??WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE MUSLIM NATIONS IN THE REGION??SAUDI ARABIA IRAN TURKEY JORDAN??ALL OF THESE NATIONS THEY??RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET THEIR HANDS DIRTY THEIR BOOTS ON THE GROUND. THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE ON ISIS. THIS IS A WAR FOR THE SOUL OF ISLAM? SAID SANDERS AT THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY DEBATE IN NOVEMBER. BUT THAT WASN??T JUST AN OFF THE CUFF GAFFE. IT??S A POINT THE VERMONT SENATOR HAS REPEATED IN PRESS RELEASES FOR THE PAST YEAR: THE WAR AGAINST ISIS HE SAID ??MUST BE WON PRIMARILY BY NATIONS IN THE REGION??SAUDI ARABIA TURKEY QATAR KUWAIT JORDAN AND IRAN???ŸWHICH MUST BE PREPARED TO SEND GROUND TROOPS INTO ACTION TO DEFEAT ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS.? SANDERS?? CAMPAIGN DID NOT RESPOND TO REQUESTS TO CLARIFY THE SENATOR??S STRATEGY ON ISIS. THE FIRST PROBLEM WITH SANDERS?? PROPOSAL IS THE VERMONT SENATOR DOESN??T SEEM TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE IS SERIOUS ANIMUS BETWEEN CERTAIN MUSLIM COUNTRIES: SAUDI ARABIA AND IRAN ARE CURRENTLY DEEPLY AT ODDS AND HAVE BEEN FOR QUITE SOME TIME. IN FACT MANY SUNNI STATES IN THE MIDDLE EAST VIEW IRAN??S GROWING REGIONAL POWER AS A CHALLENGE RIVALING THAT OF ISIS ITSELF??MANY AMERICAN PARTNERS IN THE REGION SUCH AS SAUDI ARABIA AND QATAR WOULD REFUSE TO COOPERATE WITH IRAN SINCE THEY BELIEVE THAT IRANIAN AGGRESSION IN IRAQ SYRIA AND YEMEN ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE SECTARIANISM THAT FUELS ISIS. ??SANDERS DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THAT SUNNI NATIONS ARE AS CONCERNED??IF NOT MORE??ABOUT IRANIAN HEGEMONIC GOALS AS THEY ARE WITH THE THREAT OF ISIS? SAID MICHAEL PREGENT AN ADJUNCT FELLOW AT THE HUDSON INSTITUTE AND A FORMER INTELLIGENCE ADVISOR TO GEN.

BOTH COUNTRIES ARE SUSPECTED OF BACKING RIVAL ARMED FACTIONS IN SYRIA??MEANING THAT IRAN AND SAUDI ARABIA ARGUABLY ALREADY HAVE TROOPS IN SYRIA IN THE FORM OF PROXY FIGHTERS THAT HAVE PROLONGED THE WAR AND THE SUFFERING ENDURED BY THE SYRIAN PEOPLE. SANDERS ALSO DOESN??T SEEM TO REALIZE THAT IRAN ALREADY HAS COMBAT FORCES IN SYRIA??AND THEY HAVE BEEN A DISASTER FOR SYRIAN CIVILIANS AND ARE ARGUABLY PUSHING MORE OF THEM TOWARDS ISIS. ??IRAN ALREADY HAS TROOPS IN SYRIA AND THEY AREN??T FIGHTING ISIS.

FOR A RISING GENERATION OF SOCIAL MEDIA STARS JUST A FEW YEARS YOUNGER THAN US IT'S A POLISHED PRODUCTION. COMING OUT VIDEOS ARE ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR GENRES OF VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE. ACCORDING TO A REPORT PUBLISHED ON THE YOUTUBE TRENDS BLOG THERE WERE OVER 36000 VIDEOS ON THE PLATFORM AS OF LAST FEBRUARY 9600 OF WHICH HAD BEEN POSTED WITHIN THE LAST YEAR. FOR SOME OF THE MOST POPULAR VLOGGERS LIKE AARON AND AUSTIN RHODES THE VIEW COUNTS ARE IN THE MILLIONS.

INGRID NILSEN??S ??SOMETHING I WANT YOU TO KNOW (COMING OUT)? SURPASSED IT WITH 13000000 VIEWS. WHEN TRADITIONAL MEDIA CELEBRITIES COME OUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA THE SPLASH IS JUST AS LARGE. A WEEK AGO HUNGER GAMES ACTRESS AMANDLA STENBERG CAME OUT AS BISEXUAL WHILE OPERATING TEEN VOGUE??S SNAPCHAT ACCOUNT. CUE TEEN VOGUE WITH THE EXCLUSIVE SCOOP: ??AMANDLA STENBERG IDENTIFIES AS A BLACK BISEXUAL WOMAN.? AT THIS POINT COMING OUT VIDEOS HAVE REACHED SUCH A CRITICAL MASS THAT MEDIA OUTLETS AND EVEN OTHER YOUTUBERS ARE STARTING TO PRODUCE LISTS OF THE ??BEST COMING OUT VIDEOS? OR EVEN THE ??TOP 5? OR THE ??TOP 10 BIGGEST YOUTUBERS WHO CAME OUT AS GAY? AS IF THEY COULD BE RANKED SOMEHOW. YAHOO DECLARED YOUTUBE THE ??IN? PLACE TO COME OUT. THERE??S EVEN AN INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEO ON YOUTUBE ABOUT HOW TO COME OUT ON YOUTUBE. THE MORE COMING OUT VIDEOS YOUTUBE CREATORS PRODUCE THE MORE CONVENTIONAL THE GENRE HAS BECOME: MOST ARE WELL-LIT TIGHTLY-FRAMED TALKING HEADS WITH TEXT READING ??I??M GAY? OR ??COMING OUT? SUPERIMPOSED ON THE THUMBNAIL. THEY TYPICALLY OPEN WITH A BIT OF BUILD-UP TO THE MAGIC WORDS. NILSEN??S FOR EXAMPLE OPENS WITH A BIG SIGH FOLLOWED BY ??OK I??M DOING THIS? AND THEN IT HAPPENS. THE REVEAL: ??I??M GAY.? I??M FIRMLY IN FAVOR OF MORE PEOPLE COMING OUT AS LGBT ESPECIALLY BRAVE YOUNGER PEOPLE WHO ARE GETTING IT OUT OF THE WAY EARLY ON IN LIFE. MILLENNIALS ARE BY FAR THE GAYEST GENERATION OR AT LEAST THE GENERATION MOST LIKELY TO OPENLY IDENTIFY AS LGBT ACCORDING TO THE PUBLIC RELIGION RESEARCH INSTITUTE. THE OVERALL PROPORTION OF LGBT PEOPLE IN THE POPULATION LIKELY HASN??T CHANGED SO THAT FINDING SPEAKS MOSTLY TO A REDUCTION OF STIGMA AROUND NON-NORMATIVE GENDER AND SEXUAL IDENTITIES.

WHEN WE??RE GENERATING LISTICLES OF THE BEST YOUNG PEOPLE TO DISCLOSE THEIR SEXUAL IDENTITIES IT??S PROBABLY TIME TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND RE-EVALUATE. ONE REASON TO BE SUSPICIOUS IS THE OBVIOUS FACT THAT YOUTUBE IS MAKING MONEY OFF OF THE POPULARITY OF COMING OUT VIDEOS. ACCORDING TO YOUTUBE TRENDS ALL THE VIDEOS IN THE GENRE HAVE COLLECTIVELY ACCRUED MORE THAN 300000000 VIEWS. ESTIMATES OF REVENUE PER VIEW VARY BUT ROUGHLY SPEAKING CONTENT CREATORS COULD HAVE COLLECTIVELY MADE CLOSE TO HALF A MILLION DOLLARS FROM DISCLOSING THEIR IDENTITIES ON THE PLATFORM. YOUTUBE??S EARNINGS WOULD BE COMPARABLE BASED ON THE 45/55 REVENUE SPLIT. I??M NOWHERE NEAR CYNICAL ENOUGH TO SUGGEST THAT YOUNG YOUTUBERS ARE COMING OUT FOR THE MONEY. FOR A GENERATION THAT PRACTICALLY BREATHES VIDEO WHERE ELSE WOULD THEY MAKE A BIG ANNOUNCEMENT? VLOGGING IS A NEW MEDIUM AND FOR POPULAR CREATORS IT??S NOT UNCOMMON TO FEEL A PERSONAL CONNECTION TO THEIR SUBSCRIBERS. BUT I AM CYNICAL ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT YOUTUBE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE AN INTEREST IN THE AD REVENUE FROM MEGA-VIRAL COMING OUT VIDEOS THAT LEAD TO ELLEN APPEARANCES THAT LEAD TO EVEN MORE VIEWS. BETWEEN THE TRENDS POST AND AN OFFICIAL LGBT COMPILATION VIDEO IN WHICH THEY INCLUDED SEVERAL COMINGS OUT YOUTUBE IS CERTAINLY NOT DISCOURAGING THE FORMAT OF THE COMING OUT VIDEO. BUT IF LGBT KIDS AND YOUNG ADULTS GET TO COME OUT AND EVERYONE MAKES A LITTLE MONEY IN THE PROCESS WHAT'S THE HARM? AFTER ALL IT'S NOT AS IF PEOPLE SHOULD AVOID BEING THEMSELVES ON SOCIAL MEDIA. AS OUR LIVES BECOME INCREASINGLY DIGITAL IT??S EXPECTED THAT THE ACT OF COMING OUT WOULD FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE. LAST OCTOBER FOR EXAMPLE IN HONOR OF NATIONAL COMING OUT DAY FACEBOOK REVEALED THAT APPROXIMATELY 800000 AMERICANS CAME OUT ON FACEBOOK??A NUMBER THEY UNCOVERED BY TRACKING UPDATES TO SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTITY ON USERS?? PROFILES. THE PROBLEM THOUGH ISN??T NECESSARILY HOW PEOPLE ARE COMING OUT IT'S THAT A SURROUNDING INTERNET DISCOURSE HUNGRY FOR BIG REVEALS SWALLOWS AND AMPLIFIES THEIR STORIES TO THE EXCLUSION OF OTHER MORE IMPORTANT FACETS OF LGBT EXPERIENCE. COMING OUT AFTER ALL ISN'T A ONE-WAY TICKET TO FREEDOM AND IT??S HARDLY THE END OF MOST PEOPLE??S STORIES. IN THE SUPPOSEDLY LIBERATED 1960S WHEN THE PREVAILING WISDOM WAS THAT SEXUALITY WAS REPRESSED AND WE NEEDED TO LET IT OUT FRENCH PHILOSOPHER MICHEL FOUCAULT POINTED OUT HOW OFTEN THE SOCIAL FORCES THAT WE CLAIM SILENCE US ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE US TO TALK ABOUT SEXUALITY IN ORDER TO BRING US FURTHER UNDER THEIR CONTROL. ??THERE IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INTERDICTIONS [OR PROHIBITIONS] ABOUT SEXUALITY AND OTHER FORMS OF INTERDICTION? HE WROTE. ??UNLIKE OTHER INTERDICTIONS SEXUAL INTERDICTIONS ARE CONSTANTLY CONNECTED WITH THE OBLIGATION TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT ONESELF.? HIS CHIEF EXAMPLE: THE CATHOLIC CHURCH DOESN'T PROHIBIT DISCUSSION OF SEX IT ACTUALLY INVITES US TO TALK ABOUT IT AT LENGTH IN THE CONFESSION BOOTH TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT OURSELVES OVER AND OVER AGAIN. FOUCAULT'S POINT WASN'T THAT WE SHOULD ALL SHUT UP STAY IN THE CLOSET AND ASSIMILATE TO THE MAINSTREAM??HE WAS HIMSELF A GAY POLITICAL RADICAL??BUT RATHER THAT WE SHOULD BE WARY OF BELIEVING THAT WE ALWAYS FREE OURSELVES WHEN WE COME OUT. AS GENDER THEORIST JUDITH BUTLER WOULD LATER WRITE ??CONVENTIONALLY ONE COMES OUT OF THE CLOSET...SO WE ARE OUT OF THE CLOSET BUT INTO WHAT? WHAT NEW UNBOUNDED SPATIALITY?? IDENTITY CATEGORIES LIKE LESBIAN GAY BISEXUAL AND TRANSGENDER CAN BE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO MAKE SENSE OF OUR EXPERIENCES BUT THEY CAN ALSO BECOME BOXES THAT CONSTRAIN THEM. A MODERN EXAMPLE: MEN DISCLOSE THAT THEY ARE GAY BUT THEN THE FDA REGULATES THEIR ABILITY TO DONATE BLOOD. YOUTUBE AND SNAPCHAT MIGHT FEEL LIKE REALMS OF ENDLESS FREEDOM AND INDIVIDUAL EXPRESSION??WHAT BUTLER CALLED ??UNBOUNDED SPATIALITY???BUT HOW FAR ARE THEY REALLY FROM THE CONFESSION BOOTH? AND WHAT NEW CONSTRAINTS ARE WAITING ONCE THE COMING OUT BUBBLE BURSTS? SHOULD WE BE ALARMED THAT FACEBOOK IS APPARENTLY CLOSELY MONITORING USERS?? GENDER AND SEXUAL IDENTITIES OR THAT YOUTUBE KEEPS TRACK OF HOW MANY VIEWS LGBT CREATORS GET WHEN THEY COME OUT? PROBABLY. IT'S ESPECIALLY TELLING THAT TRAFFIC TO COMING OUT VIDEOS DWARFS TRAFFIC TO VLOGS ABOUT OTHER ASPECTS OF LGBT LIFE. SURE SOMETHING SALACIOUS LIKE LESBIANS TOUCHING A PENIS FOR THE FIRST TIME WILL RACK UP THE VIEWS BUT CHECK THE COUNT ON A VIDEO ABOUT A TRANSGENDER WOMAN DISCUSSING THE PROBLEMS WITH CHROMOSOME-BASED SEX DETERMINATION OR A VIDEO ABOUT BIPHOBIA IN THE LESBIAN COMMUNITY. THE PUBLIC LOVES THE FIRST PART OF THE LGBT STORY??THE TEARFUL CONFESSION THE CATHARSIS THE DRAMATIC DECLARATION??BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO WANT TO STICK AROUND TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. THEY LOVE THE \I AM\"" BUT THE \""SO WHAT?? NOT SO MUCH. IT'S THE SAME REASON WHY NEARLY 17 MILLION PEOPLE TUNED IN TO WATCH CAITLYN JENNER COME OUT BUT ALMOST NO ONE WATCHED I AM CAIT. THERE'S A UNIVERSAL APPEAL TO THE COMING OUT SECTION OF THE STORY BECAUSE IT SOOTHES US INTO BELIEVING THAT WE ALWAYS HAVE THE POWER TO SHAPE OUR CIRCUMSTANCES INSTEAD OF THE OTHER WAY AROUND. THE NITTY-GRITTY DETAILS OF WHAT IT'S LIKE TO ACTUALLY BE LGBT??THE INFORMATION THAT WOULD HELP BUILD EMPATHY AND THAT COULD LEAD TO FURTHER SOCIAL CHANGE AND LEGISLATIVE ACTION??DOESN'T PROVIDE THAT SAME REASSURANCE. THIS DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE NEW KIDS ON THE DIGITAL BLOCK ARE TO BLAME FOR PUBLIC APATHY TOWARD LGBT ISSUES. BUT IT DOES CALL INTO QUESTION THE ENTERPRISE OF COMING OUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA IN CAREFULLY-PRODUCED VIDEOS AND THE FUROR THAT SURROUNDS IT: WHAT IS IT ACCOMPLISHING? WHO??S WATCHING AND WHY?

786,10032606.0,2016-01-18T05:08:00+00:00,THE PROHIBITION DOC WHO PRESCRIBED BOOZE,IN 1920 AFTER LEADING A FIVE-YEAR CAMPAIGN TO STAMP OUT THE NARCOTICS TRADE IN THE PHILIPPINES SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR VETERAN MAJOR ALFRED V. DALRYMPLE WAS APPOINTED CHICAGO??S CHIEF PROHIBITION OFFICER. AT A TALK IN THE TOWN??S CITY CLUB THAT AUTUMN HE ARGUED THAT BENEDICT ARNOLD ??WAS NO GREATER TRAITOR THAN ANY CITIZEN WHO OPPOSES THE ENFORCEMENT PROHIBITION WHILE IT REMAINS A LAW.? DALRYMPLE SINGLED OUT TWO GROUPS FOR PARTICULAR EXCORIATION: PHARMACISTS AND PHYSICIANS. IN FACT HE HAD SWORN EARLIER THAT YEAR THAT HE PLANNED TO FILL JAILS SO FULL OF DOCTORS AND DRUGGISTS ??THAT THEIR FEET WILL STICK OUT THE WINDOWS.? THE MAJOR COMES ACROSS AS A BIT OF A BLOWHARD AS WE LOOK BACK WITH ALMOST A CENTURY OF HINDSIGHT. BUT HERE??S THE THING: HE WASN??T WRONG. DOCTORS AND DRUGGISTS WERE STEERING A LOT OF LIQUOR INTO AMERICANS?? HANDS. WHAT WE CALL PROHIBITION WAS AN ACCRETION OF SHIFTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS??BOOKENDED BY TWO CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS??THAT CONTROLLED PRODUCTION OF AND ACCESS TO INDUSTRIAL MEDICINAL AND BEVERAGE ALCOHOL IN THE UNITED STATES FROM 1920 UNTIL 1933. ALTHOUGH TOTAL PROHIBITION IN AMERICA?ŸWAS THE UTOPIAN DREAM OF SOME TEMPERANCE CRUSADERS AND ANTI-SALOON ZEALOTS WHAT THE VOLSTEAD ACT ACTUALLY FORBADE WAS NOT ALCOHOL BUT INTOXICATING BEVERAGES. WHISKEY FOR A JULEP? THAT??S A BEVERAGE. NO DICE. WHISKEY FOR HEADACHES THOUGH OR COUGHS? WHY THAT??S MEDICINE (SPIRITUS FRUMENTI IN APOTHECARY LATIN) EXPRESSLY PERMITTED UNDER THE ACT. FOR PATIENTS WITH LEGITIMATE MEDICAL COMPLAINTS A SUPPLY OF BONDED WHISKEY BRANDY NEW ENGLAND RUM OR FORTIFIED WINES WAS AS CLOSE AS THE NEAREST DRUGSTORE. UNTIL MEDICINAL CANNABIS CAME AROUND YOU NEVER SAW A NATION OF SUCH SICKLY PEOPLE??OR DISPENSARIES GOING UP SO FAST. DURING THE VOLSTEAD YEARS SCOFFLAW PHYSICIANS ROUTINELY PADDED OUT THEIR INCOMES BY HELPING PATIENTS QUALIFY FOR WHISKEY ALLOWANCES WITH BOGUS PRESCRIPTIONS. ONE NEW YORK DOCTOR SEEMS TO HAVE TAKEN A DIFFERENT NO LESS ILLEGAL APPROACH TO ALCOHOL. FROM 1921 TO ABOUT 1930 GERMAN-BORN PHYSICIAN VICTOR LYON KEPT A SECRET JOURNAL OF?ŸBOOZE RECIPES. IF PUBLISHED DURING PROHIBITION LYON??S RECIPES AND FORMULAS FOR MAKING AND FAKING SPIRITS WINES AND CORDIALS COULD HAVE LANDED THE DOCTOR IN JAIL. COCKTAILS PER SE WERE NOT ILLEGAL THEN AMERICANS COULD MIX DRINKS AT HOME WITH ALCOHOL PURCHASED BEFORE PROHIBITION UNTIL THEIR SUPPLIES RAN DRY. INSTRUCTIONS FOR PRODUCING ALCOHOL HOWEVER WERE FORBIDDEN. PUBLISHERS COULD BE AND WERE ARRESTED AND FINED IF THEY PROVIDED FORMULAS FOR MAKING LIQUOR WINES OR BEER. JUST DAYS INTO THE NOBLE EXPERIMENT IN 1920 FOR INSTANCE REVENUE AGENTS NABBED JOHN MITCHELL EDITOR OF THE RICHMOND PLANET FOR PUBLISHING A BOOZE RECIPE COLLECTION. WISELY DR. LYON CAMOUFLAGED HIS NOTES. THEY CAME TO MY ATTENTION ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO WHEN THE LATE PHILADELPHIA CHEF FRITZ BLANK SLID A LITTLE BLUE BOOK ACROSS HIS LIBRARY TABLE. ??HERE? HE SAID ??THIS IS MORE YOUR AREA THAN MINE.? LIKE ME FRITZ WAS A COLLECTOR. OUR SHARED OBSESSION? BOOKS ABOUT FOOD DRINKS AND THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE THEM. ALTHOUGH I??D HANDLED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF COOKBOOKS BARTENDERS?? GUIDES MANUALS ON LIVESTOCK BUTCHERY AND RELATED MATERIAL THE FORMAT AND SIZE OF THAT BLUE ONE WAS UNFAMILIAR. SOMETHING UNUSUAL THEN SOMETHING RARE. I GLANCED AT FRITZ SITTING NEARBY BUT HE LOOKED AWAY PULLING A FOLDER FROM ONE OF HIS RESEARCH PILES. I TURNED THE BOOK OVER IN MY HANDS. GOLD LETTERS GLITTERED AS LIGHT HIT ITS SPINE: GEORGE SYLVESTER VIERECK. I FROWNED AND TURNED TO FACE HIM. ??WHO IS VIERECK?? ??I HAVE NO IDEA.? HE HAD ALREADY PULLED HIS GLASSES FROM THEIR PERCH ON HIS BOXY LITTLE CHEF??S HAT AND WAS MAKING A SHOW OF BUSYING HIMSELF WITH THE FOLDER??S CONTENTS. ??LOOK INSIDE.? THE NAME BOTHERED ME. GEORGE SYLVESTER VIERECK. AN AUTHOR OBVIOUSLY BUT ?? SOMETHING ELSE. SOMETHING SORDID. WHEN I OPENED THE BOOK AND BEGAN RUNNING MY EYES AND FINGERTIPS OVER THE PAGES ANY THOUGHTS OF SCANDAL-HOUNDED WRITERS DRAINED AWAY. THE WEAR ON ITS COVER THE BRITTLE AND SLIGHTLY TANNED PAPER THOSE VANILLA SMELLS OF SLOW DECOMPOSITION AND THE ARCHAIC HANDWRITING ALL SUGGESTED THE THING WAS OLDER THAN EITHER OF US AT THE TABLE. THE BOOK??S AGE HOWEVER MIGHT HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE FEW TRUE THINGS ABOUT IT. THE ENTIRE THING FROM COVER TO COVER WAS A DECEPTION. DESPITE THE SPINE??S PROMISE OF VIERECK??S WRITING THERE WERE NO PRINTED PAGES AT ALL. INSTEAD: HUNDREDS OF HANDWRITTEN NOTES ABOUT AND FORMULAS FOR BOOZE. RECIPES FOR GIN AND OTHER JUNIPER SPIRITS CROPPED UP AGAIN AND AGAIN SO DID A DOZEN OR SO FOR ABSINTHES. CORDIALS. WHISKEYS BOTH REAL AND ARTIFICIAL. BRANDIES. NOT BRANDIES FOR CONNOISSEURS BUT THERE THEY WERE ALONG WITH NOTES ON HOW ALCOHOL REACTS UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS AND HOW COGNAC MIGHT BE COLORED WITH OAK EXTRACT AND ADJUSTED WITH SYRUPS TO GET READY FOR MARKET. LOOSE SLIPS OF PAPER TUCKED IN ITS PAGES TIED IT TO PROHIBITION-ERA NEW YORK HERE WAS A PRESCRIPTION FROM A MANHATTAN HOSPITAL THERE A BUSINESS CARD FROM HARLEM. FLIPPING BETWEEN THE PAGES I REALIZED MOST OF THE RECIPES WERE IN ENGLISH BUT DOZENS WERE IN GERMAN A LANGUAGE I HADN??T SPOKEN SINCE ADOLESCENCE. THERE WAS K?¬MMEL DOPPEL K?¬MMEL AND EISK?¬MMEL. LATIN TOO CREPT IN AS LATER ENTRIES VEERED INTO PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS. LOTION FOR HEAD LICE. TATTOO REMOVAL. SALVES FOR CHILBLAINS AND CURES FOR FRECKLES. I LOOKED UP AT FRITZ. ??FRECKLES NEED CURES?? HE SMILED AND WAVED AWAY MY QUESTION WITH AN AVUNCULAR SHOO. ??IT??S YOURS. HAVE IT.? AND SO THAT LITTLE BLUE BOOK CAME TO ME ITS TEMPORARY CUSTODIAN. IN THE INTERVENING YEARS I CHIPPED AWAY AT ITS RECIPES SUSSING OUT THEIR SOURCES. I LOOKED INTO THE LIFE OF VIERECK A DISGRACED GERMAN-AMERICAN AUTHOR WHOM COLONEL HENRY WATTERSON OF LOUISVILLE??S COURIER-JOURNAL ONCE CALLED A ??VENOM-BLOATED TOAD OF TREASON? FOR HIS PRO-GERMAN PROPAGANDA. EVENTUALLY I TRACED THE NOTEBOOK TO VICTOR LYON A DOCTOR WHO KEPT AN OFFICE IN THE FAMILY??S HARLEM HOME. DESPITE PENCILED ADJUSTMENTS HERE AND THERE AMONG LYON??S NOTES ALMOST ALL HIS ALCOHOL FORMULAS WERE CULLED FROM ENGLISH AND GERMAN LANGUAGE DRUGGISTS?? HANDBOOKS JOURNAL ARTICLES FARMING BOOKS DISTILLERS?? TREATISES AND CORDIAL-MAKERS?? MANUALS DATING BACK TO THE MIDDLE OF THE 19TH CENTURY??EARLIER THAN PROHIBITION EARLIER EVEN THAN BRAM STOKER??S DRACULA OLDER THAN THE FIRST AMERICAN FOOTBALL GAME OLDER IN SOME CASES THAN THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR. THESE AREN??T FORMULAS THAT ORIGINATED IN THE JAZZ AGE IN MOST CASES THEY PRECEDED IT. NOW VICTOR LYON WAS A MASTER AT THE LOW PROFILE. NO PHOTO OF HIM??NOT EVEN FROM A PASSPORT APPLICATION??HAS SURFACED. AFTER HIS MOTHER DIED IN 1921 AND HIS FATHER FOUR YEARS LATER FEDERAL AND STATE CENSUS WORKERS NOTED HIM LIVING AT THE HARLEM ADDRESS FOR DECADES WITH HIS UNMARRIED SISTER (A ??SPINSTER? THE RECORDS CALL HER). HE POPS UP IN SOME MEDICAL DIRECTORIES ALUMNI LISTS AND SERVED ON AN EXEMPTION BOARD FOR CONSCRIPTS IN WORLD WAR I. IN THAT WAR HE HAD REGISTERED AS A PHYSICIAN WORKING FOR GENERAL ELECTRIC. OTHER THAN THAT THE MAN??S A GHOST. HIS REGISTRATION FORM FOR THE WAR NOTES THAT HE IS TALL WITH GREY EYES AND GREY HAIR. HE CLAIMS WRITING IN THAT FAMILIAR SCRIPT WE SEE IN THE NOTEBOOK TO BE NATIVE-BORN AMERICAN BUT HE LIED RAMPANT ANTI-GERMAN HYSTERIA IN THE UNITED STATES AT THE TIME LED MANY SO-CALLED ??HYPHENATED AMERICANS? TO HIDE OR OUTRIGHT REJECT THEIR GERMANIC HERITAGE. SO WHY DID LYON WRITE THESE RECIPES? ONE POSSIBILITY IS THAT HE WAS SAFEGUARDING KNOWLEDGE HE FELT MIGHT BE LOST MUCH AS MEDIEVAL MONKS ONCE LABORED BEHIND MONASTERY WALLS TO TRANSCRIBE AND PRESERVE ANCIENT WORKS. EVEN IF THAT??S ALL HE WAS DOING IT MAKES FOR FASCINATING READING A RARE PEEK BEHIND THE CURTAIN OF AMERICAN BEVERAGE ARTS. ANOTHER POSSIBILITY HINTED AT BY HIS MARGINALIA AND CORRECTIONS?ŸIS THAT THIS WAS HIS WORKING RECIPE BOOK. AFTER ALL THE FORMULAS AREN??T RANDOM OF THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SUCH BOOZE RECIPES FLOATING AROUND A CENTURY AGO LYON RECORDED MANY WITH SUPPOSED HEALTH-GIVING PROPERTIES. GIN BLOSSOMED AS A PROHIBITION STAPLE IN PART BECAUSE NEARLY ANYBODY COULD MAKE SIMPLE VERSIONS WITH NOTHING MORE THAN JUNIPER OIL ALCOHOL AND A JUG BUT SINCE ITS EARLIEST DAYS THE JUNIPER-FLAVORED SPIRIT HAS BEEN TOUTED AS SOVEREIGN AGAINST URINARY TRACT COMPLAINTS. PEPPERMINT OIL ESSENTIAL TO SO MANY CR??ME DE MENTHE FORMULAS HAS BEEN USED TO SETTLED QUARRELSOME BELLIES SINCE COLONIAL DAYS. STILL IS. GINGER WINE? OFFICIAL PHARMACY MANUALS PRESCRIBED IT FOR STOMACH COMPLAINTS FOR CENTURIES. BRANDY COMFORTS COLDS AND LIKE WHISKEY IS USED AS A SOLVENT FOR MEDICINAL HERBS. ABSINTHE BANNED EVEN BEFORE NATIONAL PROHIBITION GAINED TRACTION IN PART BECAUSE SWISS AND FRENCH DOCTORS PRESCRIBED IT AS AN ANTI-MALARIAL. THE NATURE OF HIS RECIPES??COMBINED WITH PENCILED ADJUSTMENTS TO QUANTITIES PRICE LISTS FOR RAW MATERIALS ADDRESSES OF SUPPLIERS FOR BOTTLES AND LABELS AND EVEN PROFIT AND LOSS CALCULATIONS SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE NOTEBOOK AND ITS EPHEMERA??SUGGESTS THAT VICTOR LYON WAS MAKING CORDIALS AND FLAVORED SPIRITS TO SELL TO HIS PATIENTS. LIKE UNCOUNTED THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS FROM BELLBOYS TO MILKMAIDS WHO EARNED A LITTLE EXTRA ON THE SIDE FROM OPPORTUNISTIC BOOTLEGGING DR. LYON SEEMS TO HAVE EMBRACED THE ILLICIT ALCOHOL TRADE. FOR NOW I??M HANGING ONTO THE DOCTOR??S NOTEBOOK. ONE DAY IT WILL END UP IN SOME LIBRARY OR MUSEUM ALONGSIDE LOST RECIPES OF PROHIBITION A BOOK I WROTE ABOUT LYON HIS NOTEBOOK AND THE BOOTLEGGING SCENE IN PROHIBITION-ERA AMERICA. UNTIL THEN GUESTS AROUND THE HOUSE MAY FIND THEMSELVES DOWNING SOME OF VICTOR LYON??S MORE ELEGANT CONCOCTIONS. GINGER BRANDY ANYONE?

THERE??S SOMETHING ABOUT THAT NAME THAT EVOKES SO MUCH IN THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF BLACK FOLKS IN PARTICULAR. SHE??D BEEN A PART OF THE HIERARCHY OF LEGENDARY SOUL DIVAS THAT INCLUDES PATTI LABELLE CHAKA KHAN ROBERTA FLACK GLADYS KNIGHT MAVIS STAPLES MINNIE RIPERTON AND OF COURSE ARETHA FRANKLIN. BUT WITH NATALIE THERE WAS ALWAYS THE LEGACY FACTOR AFTER ALL SHE WAS THE DAUGHTER OF NAT ??KING? COLE A SINGER WHO??D REPRESENTED BLACK ASPIRATION FOR A GENERATION IN MANY WAYS. SHE ALWAYS FELT LIKE A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE GENERATION THAT HAD GROWN UP ON POP AND JAZZ STANDARDS AND THE ROCK AND SOUL KIDS WHO IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED IT. IT??S APPROPRIATE THAT HER CAREER WOULD BE DEFINED BY VERSATILITY. LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE AS ONE OF THE GREAT SINGERS OF POP AND JAZZ STANDARDS COLE SOAKED UP ALL OF HER FATHER??S INFLUENCE WHILE ALSO DIVING HEADFIRST INTO ROCK N?? ROLL AND R&B. SHE WAS AS VERSED IN SARAH VAUGHAN AS SHE WAS IN THE BEATLES WITH HER FATHER BRINGING EVERYTHING FROM ORCHESTRAL POP TO BLUES INTO THEIR HOUSE. ??I WAS MADLY IN LOVE WITH ELVIS PRESLEY? SHE WOULD LATER REFLECT IN HER MEMOIR. ??DAD WASN'T INTO IT AT ALL AT LEAST NOT FOR HIMSELF AS A PERFORMER. HE USED TO SAY ??MR. COLE DOES NOT ROCK 'N' ROLL.??? AND COLE??S MUSIC CONSISTENTLY SHOWCASED HER WIDE RANGE OF INFLUENCES AND THE DIVERSITY OF HER TALENTS. INITIALLY SHE WAS MARKETED AS A SOUL SINGER THE DAUGHTER OF A LEGEND AND ??HEIR APPARENT? TO QUEEN ARETHA. HER VOICE COULD BE AS BOLD AS IT WAS NUANCED AND SHE LANDED AS CLASSIC SOUL WAS BEGINNING TO GIVE WAY TO DISCO??A TIME WHEN MANY OF THE SOUL LEGENDS OF THE 60S AND EARLY 70S WERE BEGINNING TO FALTER IN THEIR COMMAND OF THE AUDIENCE??S ATTENTION. HER EARLY ALBUMS FEATURED THE SONGWRITING OF HER FREQUENT COLLABORATORS CHUCK JACKSON AND MARVIN YANCEY TWO VETERAN MUSICIANS (JACKSON HAD BEEN AN ESTABLISHED WRITER IN THE EARLY 60S YANCEY HAD MOVED FROM GOSPEL SUCCESS TO SECULAR MUSIC UPON MEETING JACKSON A DECADE LATER). THE RESULTING MUSIC LED TO A STRING OF HITS FOR THE SINGER INCLUDING ??THIS WILL BE (AN EVERLASTING LOVE)? AND ??SOPHISTICATED LADY.? HER PIANO PLAYING AND SONGWRITING WERE ALSO SHOWCASED ON ALBUMS LIKE INSEPARABLE AND UNPREDICTABLE. A DECADE AFTER LOSING HER FATHER NAT??S LITTLE GIRL HAD BEEN CATAPULTED INTO THE CENTER OF LATE 70S STARDOM.?Ÿ AS HAS BEEN WELL-DOCUMENTED THE PRESSURES OF THAT STARDOM WERE ALMOST TOO MUCH FOR THE TWENTYSOMETHING COLE TO BEAR. SHE??D LOST HER FAMOUS DAD JUST DAYS AFTER SHE TURNED 15 BACK IN 1965 AND HAD BEEN SADDLED WITH THE ??NEXT ARETHA? TAG FROM THE MOMENT SHE RELEASED HER FIRST ALBUM. SHE REFLECTED MANY YEARS LATER ON THE INSECURITIES SHE FELT EARLIER IN HER CAREER WITH THESE TWO FIGURES LOOMING SO LARGE OVER EVERYTHING THAT SHE??D DONE. HER INSECURITIES LED HER TO DRUGS NAMELY HEROIN AND FREEBASING. HER AUTOBIOGRAPHY ANGEL ON MY SHOULDER FAMOUSLY DETAILED AN INSTANCE WHERE SHE ALMOST DIED IN A FIRE IN THE EARLY 80S BECAUSE SHE WAS COMMITTED TO GETTING HIGH BEFORE SHE WOULD EVACUATE AND ALSO TOUCHED ON ANOTHER RATTLING EXPERIENCE WHERE HER SON ALMOST DROWNED WHILE SHE WAS STONED. IT WOULD BE MISGUIDED TO REDUCE NATALIE COLE??S STORY TO JUST ONE OF TRIUMPH OVER HEROIN HOWEVER. COLE??S LONGEVITY AS A TOP-TIER ARTIST??SHE WAS A NINE-TIME GRAMMY WINNER??IS REMARKABLE TO SAY THE LEAST. HER BODY OF WORK SPANS FOUR DECADES AND A MYRIAD OF STYLES: FROM THE SHUFFLING SOUL OF ??SOPHISTICATED LADY? TO THE BRASSY 80S POP OF ??PINK CADILLAC? TO THE MORE TRADITIONAL JAZZINESS OF HER 90S OUTPUT. IN BEING SO WIDE OPEN AND DIVERSE COLE??S MUSIC IS NOW A STUDY IN BLACK POPULAR MUSIC OF THE NON-HIP-HOP VARIETY A SONIC TIMELINE THAT EXEMPLIFIES JUST HOW MERCURIAL THE TERM ??R&B? HAS ALWAYS BEEN. AND IN A POP CLIMATE THAT CAN SO OFTEN BE DISMISSIVE OF WOMEN MATURING SHE WAS EVEN MORE VISIBLE IN THE 1990S THAN SHE??D BEEN BEFORE. WHEN SHE RE-EMERGED IN 1991 IT WAS AS A MUCH MORE CONFIDENT WOMAN WHO WAS ENTERING HER FORTIES?Ÿ DETERMINED TO CHART HER OWN CAREER COURSE??AND NOT BE DEFINED BY FEARS OF WHO SHE COULD BE COMPARED TO. ??I'VE ALWAYS ADORED MY FATHER'S MUSIC BUT EVER SINCE I'D STARTED SINGING WHETHER IT WAS WHILE I WAS STILL A STUDENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS OR PROFESSIONALLY I AVOIDED DAD'S MATERIAL? SHE WROTE IN HER SECOND MEMOIR LOVE BROUGHT ME BACK. ??I WAS DETERMINED TO CREATE MY OWN IDENTITY. MY FIRST HITS IN FACT WERE STRAIGHT-UP RHYTHM AND BLUES. MY VOICE WAS COMPARED TO ARETHA FRANKLIN'S THOUGH FOR MY MONEY NO ONE COMPARES TO ARETHA.?Ÿ ??BY THE TIME I APPROACHED MY FORTIES I HAD THE SELF-ASSURANCE TO APPROACH ALL THE GENRES I LOVE SO DEEPLY: R & B ROCK JAZZ AND POP. MY DAD BRIDGED JAZZ AND POP WITH SUCH APLOMB THAT EVEN WITH MY NEWFOUND CONFIDENCE I WAS HESITANT. BUT I DID IT AND THE RESULT CHANGED MY MUSICAL LIFE. UNFORGETTABLE ?? WITH LOVE SOLD SOME FOURTEEN MILLION COPIES.? IN CEMENTING HER RETURN TO CHARTS WITH HER GRAMMY-WINNING DUETS ALBUM COLE CEMENTED HER LEGEND AS WELL. SHE PROVED THAT SHE WASN??T ONLY CAPABLE OF BEATING DRUGS SHE WAS CAPABLE OF TRANSCENDING THE PRESSURES THAT HAD DEFINED THE FIRST HALF OF HER CAREER. TINA TURNER??S COMEBACK MAY BE MORE LIONIZED IN THE PUBLIC CONSCIOUSNESS BUT NATALIE COLE??S IS JUST AS INSPIRING AND UNLIKELY. THE LONG LIST OF ARTISTS WHO NEVER MADE IT BACK FROM THE BRINK IS ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO PROVE THAT THESE STARS DON??T ALWAYS FIND HAPPY ENDINGS BUT NATALIE COLE FOUND HERS??AS AN ARTIST AND AS A WOMAN. SHE NEVER STOPPED PUSHING HERSELF NEVER STOPPED BEING OPEN. ??I LISTEN TO EVERYTHING FROM GOSPEL MUSIC TO R&B? COLE SAID IN A 2013 INTERVIEW. ??I HAVE (POP-ROCK BAND) MAROON 5 ON MY PHONE AS ONE OF MY RING TONES. I LOVE ADELE. I'M LISTENING TO A LOT OF SPANISH MUSIC TOO. I WAS AT THE LATIN GRAMMYS. EVEN PITBULL CAME OUT AND DID SOMETHING WITH SOMEBODY.? THERE??S A TENDENCY IN OUR CULTURE TO MYTHOLOGIZE ARTISTS WHO SUCCUMB TO ADDICTIONS OR DEPRESSION. WHITNEY HOUSTON IS PROBABLY THE EASIEST TO EVOKE AS IT PERTAINS TO SUPERSTAR FEMALE VOCALISTS WHO WERE OVERWHELMED BY THEIR DEMONS A LIST THAT ALSO INCLUDES NAMES LIKE JUDY GARLAND AND AMY WINEHOUSE. AND THERE ARE SEVERAL EXAMPLES OF CELEBRITY KIDS WHO GREW UP TO BECOME DYSFUNCTIONAL PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THE SPOTLIGHT THEIR FAMILY NAME PLACED THEM UNDER. NATALIE COLE HAD TO NAVIGATE BOTH. BUT SHE DIDN??T BECOME TOTALLY SUBMERGED IN THE DARKNESS SHE FOUGHT BACK AND ULTIMATELY WON. IN ADDITION TO HER MUSICAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS SHE WAS AN ESTABLISHED AUTHOR AND EARNED A DEGREE IN CHILD PSYCHOLOGY. SHE MADE ONE HELL OF A LIFE FOR HERSELF AND NEVER FELT SHAME OR SORROW FOR HER SOMETIMES-HARROWING JOURNEY. ??ONE OF THINGS IS THAT YOU MUST LIVE YOUR LIFE IF POSSIBLE WITHOUT REGRET? SHE TOLD ESSENCE IN 2010. ??IF YOU ARE THE KIND OF PERSON WHO IS OPEN TO LEARNING EVERY NEGATIVE THING THAT EVER HAPPENED EVERY MISTAKE YOU EVER MADE AND EVERY CHOICE IS GOING TO AFFECT YOU IN A WAY WHETHER IT'S GOOD OR BAD. IT WILL CHANGE YOU. YOU HAVE TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR CHOICES. YOU CAN'T MOAN AND WHINE AND FEEL SORRY FOR YOURSELF WHEN THE CONSEQUENCES AREN'T WHAT YOU HOPED THEY WOULD BE. YOU DEAL WITH IT. UNFORTUNATELY WE DO HAVE SOME YOUNG PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO HAVE MADE SOME REALLY BAD CHOICES AND IT DID KILL THEM. I WOULD SAY TO THE ONES WHO ARE STILL STANDING ??WATCH YOURSELF. KEEP YOUR EAR TO THE GROUND. BE A GOOD OBSERVER. TREAT PEOPLE WELL AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR CHOICES.??\ IT??S A SHAME THAT SO MANY YOUNGER MUSIC FANS MAY NOT TRULY UNDERSTAND HOW GREAT THIS DIVA WAS THE SCOPE OF HER TALENT THE BREADTH OF HER ARTISTRY THE FORTITUDE OF HER SPIRIT. BECAUSE NATALIE COLE WAS ONE OF THE ALL-TIME GREAT ARTISTS AND SINGERS MORE THAN JUST A FAMOUS DAUGHTER MORE THAN JUST ??YOUR MOMMA??S FAVORITE.? SHE WAS A SURVIVOR. SHE WAS A LEGEND.

TOWN HALL WAS MORE LIKE A WWF MATCH,PRESIDENT OBAMA MAY HAVE EXPECTED TOUGH QUESTIONS IN THURSDAY NIGHT??S ??GUNS IN AMERICA? TOWN HALL BUT I THINK IT??S FAIR TO SAY HE WAS AMBUSHED. OF THE FIRST FIVE QUESTIONS THREE CAME FROM GUN RIGHTS ADVOCATES WHO MADE IT CLEAR THEY WERE NOT THERE TO GET ANSWERS SO MUCH AS TO AIR GRIEVANCES. A RAPE SURVIVOR A SHERIFF AND THE WIDOW OF AMERICAN SNIPER CHRIS KYLE ALL MADE FOR SYMPATHETIC CHARACTERS WHOSE BACKSTORY BROUGHT EMOTIONAL WEIGHT TO AN ARGUMENT AGAINST FURTHER GUN REGULATION THAT WAS LESS CONSTITUTIONAL THAN HOBBESIAN: CRIMINALS DON??T OBEY LAWS SO WHY BOTHER MAKING THEM? OR AS TAYA KYLE CONFUSINGLY PUT IT ??WE CANNOT OUTLAW MURDER.? LATER A REPRESENTATIVE FROM FIREARMS RETAILERS MADE A SOFTER PITCH: JUST DON??T MAKE ANY NEW LAWS HE ARGUED ECHOING A FAMILIAR CONSERVATIVE TALKING POINT. ??JUST ENFORCE THE ONES WE HAVE.? OBAMA RESTRAINED HIS EYE ROLL AND POINTED OUT THAT BY DEFINITION NOTHING HE WAS PROPOSING WAS A NEW LAW. THAT WOULD REQUIRE CONGRESS TO ACT AFTER ALL. A BLEAK OUTLOOK ON THE POWER OF EVEN THE POINT OF GOVERNMENT WAS WIDELY HELD ON BOTH SIDES OF THE DEBATE. GUN CONTROL ADVOCATES WHO SPOKE TO THE PRESIDENT QUERIED WITH PESSIMISM AND DARK HUMOR. CHICAGO??S FATHER MICHAEL PFLEGER WONDERED ALOUD??MORE THAN ASKED??WHY IT WAS THAT WE CAN??T ??TITLE GUNS LIKE CARS?? OBAMA DIDN??T ANSWER THAT QUESTION DIRECTLY AND WHY SHOULD HE BOTHER? EVERYONE KNOWS WHY WE CAN??T TITLE GUNS LIKE CARS AND IT??S BECAUSE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE TALKING JUST BEFORE FATHER PFLEGER THE ONES WHO MIGHT ARGUE THAT CAR TITLES DON??T KEEP PEOPLE FROM STEALING. MARK KELLY GABBY GIFFORDS??S HUSBAND POSED A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT TO THE PRESIDENT: THERE ARE 350000000 GUNS IN AMERICA KELLY SAID. IF YOU WERE GOING TO CONFISCATE THEM HOW WOULD YOU GO ABOUT DOING IT? THAT IS BOTH A SILLY QUESTION AND AN HONEST ONE SOMETHING TED CRUZ AND OTHER ALARMISTS SHOULD HAVE TO ANSWER MORE THAN OBAMA.

393,9787494.0,2016-01-10T05:01:00+00:00,ARE RUSSIANS AND UKRAINIANS THE SAME PEOPLE?,IN THE LAST FEW YEARS VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS SURPRISED MANY OBSERVERS OF THE INTERNATIONAL SCENE NOT ONLY BY HIS ACTIONS BUT ALSO BY HIS WORDS. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE UKRAINE CRISIS WHILE THE RUSSIAN MEDIA WAS VILIFYING THE NEW GOVERNMENT IN KYIV AS NOTHING LESS THAN A ??FASCIST JUNTA? HE REPEATEDLY WENT ON RECORD CLAIMING THAT RUSSIANS AND UKRAINIANS WERE ONE AND THE SAME PEOPLE. WHAT IT MEANT IN PRACTICE WAS DEMONSTRATED IN MARCH 2014 WHEN THE RUSSIAN TROOPS TOOK OVER THE UKRAINIAN CRIMEA WHICH PUTIN DECLARED A HISTORICAL HERITAGE SITE COMMON TO THE RUSSIANS UKRAINIANS AND BELARUSIANS AND THE PLACE WHERE HIS NAMESAKE PRINCE VLADIMIR (UKR. VOLODYMYR) OF KYIV HAD BEEN BAPTIZED. RUSSIA??S ANNEXATION OF THE CRIMEA MADE THIS ALLEGEDLY COMMON SITE AN EXCLUSIVELY RUSSIAN POSSESSION. THE VIEW OF UKRAINIANS AS CONSTITUENTS OF THE RUSSIAN NATION GOES BACK TO THE FOUNDING MYTH OF MODERN RUSSIA AS A NATION CONCEIVED AND BORN IN KYIV (KIEV) IN THE TENTH AND ELEVENTH CENTURIES DURING THE TIMES OF ST. VLADIMIR. IT WAS FIRST WIDELY DISSEMINATED IN RUSSIA BY THE SYNOPSIS OF 1674 THE FIRST PRINTED ??TEXTBOOK? OF RUSSIAN HISTORY COMPILED BY KYIVAN MONKS SEEKING THE PROTECTION OF THE MUSCOVITE TSARS. THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE IMPERIAL PERIOD UKRAINIANS WERE REGARDED AS LITTLE RUSSIANS??A VISION THAT ALLOWED FOR THE EXISTENCE OF UKRAINIAN FOLK CULTURE AND SPOKEN VERNACULAR BUT NOT A HIGH CULTURE OR A MODERN LITERATURE. THAT VISION WAS CHALLENGED IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE REVOLUTION OF 1917 WHEN THE UKRAINIANS WERE RECOGNIZED AS A DISTINCT NATION IN CULTURAL BUT NOT POLITICAL TERMS. THE LEADERS OF THE SOVIET UNION RECOGNISED THE RUSSIANS UKRAINIANS AND BELARUSIANS TO BE SEPARATE NATIONS BUT ON THE EVE OF THE SOVIET COLLAPSE ALEXANDER SOLZHENITSYN HAD INSISTED THAT UKRAINE BELARUS AND NORTHERN KAZAKHSTAN SHOULD MERGE WITH RUSSIA. THIS VISION DID NOT MATERIALIZE AFTER THE FALL OF THE USSR BUT NEITHER HAD IT DISAPPEARED ENTIRELY. SINCE THE FALL OF THE SOVIET UNION THE RUSSIAN NATIONALIST PROJECT HAS EMBRACED THE IDEA OF THE UNIFICATION OF THE EASTERN SLAVS ON THE BASIS OF THE RUSSIAN LANGUAGE AND CULTURE. THIS VISION OF GREATER RUSSIA FOUND A LOT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT AND WAS BACKED BY THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH THROUGH THE ??RUSSIAN WORLD FOUNDATION? WHICH HAS BEEN TASKED WITH THE PROMOTION OF RUSSIAN LANGUAGE AND CULTURE ABROAD AND THE ??FORMATION OF THE RUSSIAN WORLD AS A GLOBAL PROJECT.? UKRAINE HAS BECOME THE FIRST TESTING GROUND FOR THE PROMOTION OF THE NEW MODEL OF RUSSIAN IDENTITY OUTSIDE THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION. THE CHANCES ARE IT WILL NOT BE THE LAST. THE REVIVAL OF IMPERIAL-ERA RUSSIAN NATIONALISM THREATENS NOT ONLY THE SOVEREIGN EAST SLAVIC STATES OF UKRAINE AND BELARUS BUT ALSO OTHER POST-SOVIET REPUBLICS WITH SIGNIFICANT EAST SLAVIC AND RUSSIAN-SPEAKING POPULATIONS??ESTONIA LATVIA AND KAZAKHSTAN. SO WHAT ABOUT RUSSIANS IN UKRAINE? THE RUSSIAN ANNEXATION OF THE CRIMEA AND THE PROPAGANDA INTENDED TO JUSTIFY RUSSIAN INTERVENTION IN THE DONBAS HAVE PROCEEDED UNDER THE SLOGAN OF DEFENDING THE RIGHTS OF ETHNIC RUSSIANS AND RUSSIAN SPEAKERS IN GENERAL. THE EQUATION OF THE RUSSIAN LANGUAGE NOT ONLY WITH RUSSIAN CULTURE BUT ALSO WITH RUSSIAN NATIONALITY HAS BEEN AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE WORLD VIEW OF MANY RUSSIAN VOLUNTEERS WHO HAVE COME TO DONBAS. ONE PROBLEM WITH THAT INTERPRETATION OF RUSSIANNESS IS THAT WHILE ETHNIC RUSSIANS ARE INDEED A MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION IN THE CRIMEA AND MAKE UP LARGE MINORITIES IN PARTS OF THE DONBAS MOST OF THE POPULATION OF THE PROJECTED NEW RUSSIA CONSISTS OF ETHNIC UKRAINIANS. WHILE RUSSIAN AND SEPARATIST PROPAGANDA HAS HAD AN APPEAL FOR MANY ETHNIC UKRAINIANS MOST HAVE REFUSED TO IDENTIFY THEMSELVES WITH RUSSIA OR WITH RUSSIAN ETHNICITY EVEN AS THEY CONTINUE TO USE THE RUSSIAN LANGUAGE. THAT WAS ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS FOR THE FAILURE OF THE CREATION OF A BUFFER STATE OF NEW RUSSIA BY EXTENDING THE REBEL HOLDINGS IN DONBAS TO ODESA AND KHARKIV IN SOUTHERN AND EASTERN UKRAINE. THE EXPANSIONIST MODEL OF RUSSIAN IDENTITY WHICH STRESSES THE INDIVISIBILITY OF THE RUSSIAN NATION CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE RUSSIAN LANGUAGE AND CULTURE PRESENTED A FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGE TO THE UKRAINIAN NATION-BUILDING PROJECT. FROM ITS BEGINNINGS IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THAT PROJECT PLACED THE UKRAINIAN LANGUAGE AND CULTURE AT ITS CENTER BUT FROM THE OUTSET IT ALSO ALLOWED FOR THE USE OF OTHER LANGUAGES AND CULTURES AS ATTESTED FOR EXAMPLE BY THE RUSSIAN-LANGUAGE WRITINGS OF TARAS SHEVCHENKO WHOM MANY REGARD AS THE SPIRITUAL FOUNDER OF THE UKRAINIAN NATION. BILINGUALISM AND MULTICULTURALISM HAVE BECOME A NORM IN POST-SOVIET UKRAINE EXTENDING MEMBERSHIP IN THE UKRAINIAN NATION TO PEOPLE OF VARIOUS ETHNIC AND RELIGIOUS BACKGROUNDS. THIS HAS HAD A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE COURSE OF THE RUSSO-UKRAINIAN CONFLICT. CONTRARY TO THE KREMLIN??S EXPECTATIONS RUSSIA-SPONSORED ??HYBRID WAR? FAILED TO MOBILIZE THE SUPPORT OF ETHNIC RUSSIANS OUTSIDE THE AREAS EITHER DIRECTLY CONTROLLED BY THE RUSSIAN ARMY AS HAS BEEN THE CASE IN THE CRIMEA OR THOSE PARTS OF THE DONBAS SEIZED BY RUSSIAN MERCENARIES AND RUSSIA-BACKED INSURGENTS. ACCORDING TO DATA PROVIDED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CRISIS BY THE RESPECTED KYIV INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SOCIOLOGY WITH RUSSIANS CONSTITUTING 17 PERCENT OF THE UKRAINIAN POPULATION ONLY 5 PERCENT OF THOSE POLLED CONSIDERED THEMSELVES EXCLUSIVELY RUSSIAN: THE REST GAVE THEIR IDENTITY AS BOTH RUSSIAN AND UKRAINIAN. EVEN THOSE WHO CONSIDERED THEMSELVES EXCLUSIVELY RUSSIAN OFTEN OPPOSED RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE IN UKRAINIAN AFFAIRS REFUSING TO ASSOCIATE THEMSELVES WITH PUTIN??S REGIME. ??UKRAINE IS MY HOMELAND. RUSSIAN IS MY NATIVE LANGUAGE. AND I WOULD LIKE TO BE SAVED BY PUSHKIN. AND DELIVERED FROM SORROW AND UNREST ALSO BY PUSHKIN. PUSHKIN NOT PUTIN? WROTE ONE OF KYIV??S ETHNIC RUSSIANS IN HER FACEBOOK ACCOUNT. THE RUSSO-UKRAINIAN CONFLICT BROUGHT TO THE FORE IMPORTANT ISSUES WITH HISTORICAL ROOTS AND RAMIFICATIONS??THE UNFINISHED PROCESS OF BUILDING NOT ONLY A UKRAINIAN BUT ALSO RUSSIAN MODERN NATION. THE RUSSIAN NATIONALIST IDEOLOGY HARKS BACK TO THE IMPERIALISM OF PREREVOLUTIONARY RUSSIA WHEN RUSSIANS UKRAINIANS AND BELARUSIANS WERE VIEWED BY THE TSARIST GOVERNMENT AS PARTS OF ONE RUSSIAN NATION. BECAUSE A MODERN POST-IMPERIAL RUSSIAN NATION HAS NOT TAKEN SHAPE THERE REMAINS A STRONG CONSTITUENCY FOR THE IDEA OF A BIG RUSSIAN NATION AND THE PROGRAM OF ??REUNITING? THE LESSER LITTLE AND WHITE RUSSIAN BRANCHES??THE UKRAINIAN AND BELARUSIAN NATIONS??WITH THE GREAT RUSSIAN TRUNK. THE ADOPTION OF THIS VISION ATTESTS TO THE INABILITY OF PRESENT-DAY RUSSIAN LEADERSHIP TO ABANDON THE IMPERIAL WAY OF THINKING AND ACCEPT THE EXISTENCE OF OTHER EAST SLAVIC NATIONS. RUSSIA TODAY FACES THE DIFFICULT TASK OF THROWING OFF THE HISTORICAL LEGACY OF EMPIRE WHICH PREVENTS IT FROM BECOMING A MODERN NATION. THE SOLUTION TO THE RUSSIAN QUESTION LIES NOT IN THE TERRITORIAL EXPANSION BUT IN THE FORMATION OF A LAW-BASED DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY CAPABLE OF LIVING IN HARMONY WITH ITS NEIGHBORS AND PLAYING A POSITIVE ROLE IN THE MODERN WORLD.

SMITH??S LATEST FASHION MOMENT WAS LAUNCHED BY NICOLAS GHESQUI??RE VUITTON??S CREATIVE DIRECTOR VIA A SET OF IMAGES ON INSTAGRAM FEATURING LOOKS FROM THE SPRING/SUMMER 2016 CAMPAIGN. THIS ISN??T SMITH??S FIRST TIME ROCKING A DRESS. LAST MAY. HE ATTENDED A PROM WITH HUNGER GAMES ACTRESS AMANDLA STENBERG WEARING A DRESS AND HE HAS INSTAGRAMMED HIS LOVE OF GOING TO TOPSHOP ??TO BUY SOME GIRL CLOTHES I MEAN ??CLOTHES.??? SMITH IT APPEARS DOESN??T GIVE A FIG ABOUT FASHION AND GENDER??S STRICTURES AND CONVENTIONS. IT??S REFRESHING TO WATCH HIS BOLD DEVIL-MAY-CARE EXPERIMENTATION ESPECIALLY AS SUCH EXPERIMENTS CAN GARNER SOME PRETTY NASTY RACIST COMMENTS ONLINE. SMITH UNDAUNTED JUST CARRIES ON WITH THE DRESS-UP. AT ANOTHER PROM HE WENT IN A FULL BATMAN SUIT. EVERY MORNING MUST BE A FUNHOUSE OF FASHION POSSIBILITIES CHEZ SMITH. OTHER MALE CELEBRITIES PHOTOGRAPHED IN SKIRTS HAVE INCLUDED??AND I EXCLUDE MEN WEARING KILTS FROM THIS LIST HANDSOME AS THEY ARE??JARED LETO VIN DIESEL THE RAPPER 2 CHAINZ DAVID BOWIE AND MARC JACOBS. IN THE WAY THAT SMITH AND SAY DIESEL AND JACOBS WEAR THE SKIRT THERE IS A CONFRONTATIONAL ATTRACTIVENESS TO THE BOUNDARIES BEING BROKEN. NOT ONLY DO THEY LOOK GREAT IN THE DRESSES THEY ARE NOT IN DRAG. THEY??RE NOT LOOKING TO LOOK LIKE WOMEN. THEY??RE NOT PERFORMING. THEY WEAR THEIR DRESSES WITH THE SAME EASE AS A PAIR OF JEANS. WHEN YOU GET TO LETO THE GENDERFUCK IS EVEN MORE FUN AND CHALLENGING: HE WEARS A BRIGHT JACKET WITH HIS DRESS BEARD AND LONG HAIR STILL IN PLACE. THE MAN-SKIRT HAS BECOME A RUNWAY REALITY IN RECENT YEARS WITH DESIGNERS INCLUDING OPENING CEREMONY AND JEREMY SCOTT AND MOST RECENTLY THE SPRING 2016 SHOW FOR GIVENCHY PRODUCING SOME STANDOUT DESIGNS. A MORE STRAIGHT-FACED GENDER NEUTRALITY??MALE AND FEMALE MODELS IN INTERCHANGEABLE GARB??HAS BEEN SEEN AT OTHER SHOWS INCLUDING KANYE WEST??S. JADEN SMITH IS CLEARLY A FREE-SPIRITED PERSON. IN 2013 AFTER REPORTS SURFACED HIS PARENTS??WILL SMITH AND JADA PINKETT SMITH??WERE GOING TO GIVE HIM AN ??EMANCIPATION?? FROM THEM FOR HIS 15TH BIRTHDAY SMITH JOKED ON ELLEN HE WOULD STAY LIVING WITH HIS PARENTS UNTIL HE MADE A FILM LARGER-GROSSING THAN HIS FATHER??S. THERE WAS ALSO HIS AND SISTER WILLOW??S MESMERIZING EYE-BOBBLING QUOTE-RICH INTERVIEW WITH THE NEW YORK TIMES?? T MAGAZINE ABOUT ??PRANA ENERGY TIME AND WHY SCHOOL IS OVER-RATED.? ECCENTRIC PEARLS FROM THIS INTERVIEW INCLUDED: ????YOUR MIND HAS A DUALITY TO IT. SO WHEN ONE THOUGHT GOES INTO YOUR MIND IT??S NOT JUST ONE THOUGHT IT HAS TO BOUNCE OFF BOTH HEMISPHERES OF THE BRAIN. WHEN YOU??RE THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING HAPPY YOU??RE THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING SAD. ??WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT AN APPLE YOU ALSO THINK ABOUT THE OPPOSITE OF AN APPLE. IT??S A TOOL FOR UNDERSTANDING MATHEMATICS AND THINGS WITH TWO SEPARATE REALITIES. BUT FOR CREATIVITY: THAT COMES FROM A PLACE OF ONENESS. THAT??S NOT A DUALITY CONSCIOUSNESS. AND YOU CAN??T LISTEN TO YOUR MIND IN THOSE TIMES??IT??LL TELL YOU WHAT YOU THINK AND ALSO WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK.? THIS AND OTHER QUOTES LIKE IT ATTRACTED INEVITABLE MOCKERY. SMITH MAY BE SOMETHING OF A PROUD FASHION AND CULTURAL REBEL BUT THE HISTORY OF MEN WEARING SKIRTS IS LONG AND SOMETIMES EXTREMELY SEXY AS WHEN JEAN-PAUL GAULTIER SENT MEN DOWN THE RUNWAY IN SKIRTS IN 1984 SETTING OFF OUR CONTEMPORARY FASCINATION WITH THE STYLE. WITH DESIGNERS LIKE VIVIENNE WESTWOOD AND DRIES VAN NOTEN CREATING THEM??AND THE TREND FOR MEN WEARING DRAPEY CAPES HOODIES AND SARONGS (DAVID BECKHAM THE MOST FAMOUS EXEMPLAR OF THIS)??MAN-SKIRTS HAVE A RICH HISTORY. NO WONDER THE STYLE MERITED AN EXHIBITION BRAVE HEARTS: MEN IN SKIRTS AT NEW YORK??S MET MUSEUM??S COSTUME INSTITUTE IN 2004. THAT EXHIBITION WAS CURATED BY THE INSTITUTE??S ASSOCIATE CURATOR ANDREW BOLTON WHO THIS SEPTEMBER BECAME ITS CURATOR IN CHARGE SUCCEEDING HAROLD KODA. BOLTON??S SHOW AND SUBSEQUENT BOOK TRACED THE EVOLUTION OF MEN WEARING SKIRTS FROM OLDEN TIMES TO TODAY??FROM WARRIOR DRESS TO THE KIND OF ENVELOPE-PUSHING GENDER CONVENTION-CHALLENGING GARB AS WORN BY SMITH. WHAT LINKS THE WARRIOR OF YESTERYEAR TO THE FASHION WARRIOR OF TODAY IS THE IDEA THAT A SKIRT CAN AUGMENT MASCULINITY RATHER THAN DETRACT FROM IT. WHEN SOMEONE LIKE SMITH WEARS A SKIRT (NOT A MAN??S SKIRT BUT A WOMEN??S ONE) WHAT STRIKES YOU IS NOT HOW WEIRD IT IS FOR A MAN TO WEAR A SKIRT BUT WHY??SUPPOSEDLY IN MORE OPEN AND CULTURALLY PLURALISTIC TIMES??DO WE FIND THE IDEA OF A MAN WEARING A DRESS TO BE SO WEIRD? THE ??WEIRD?? IS HOW SOCIALLY PROSCRIBED AND VERBOTEN WEARING A DRESS OR SKIRT FOR MEN HAS BECOME HOW IT HAS BECOME FREIGHTED WITH ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT SEXUAL AND GENDER IDENTITY. THERE IS NOTHING STRANGE IN JADEN SMITH WEARING A DRESS FOR A WOMENSWEAR CAMPAIGN??THE IMAGERY GUARANTEES GREAT PUBLICITY. THERE IS EVERYTHING STRANGE IN THE SOCIAL PANIC SURROUNDING MEN WEARING DRESSES. JADEN SMITH SAYS UNDOUBTEDLY SOME PRETTY WEIRD THINGS ABOUT THE WORKINGS OF THE UNIVERSE. HE IS CLEARLY PRECOCIOUS AND MAYBE PRETENTIOUS??BUT IN HIS GORGEOUSLY PHOTOGRAPHED SARTORIAL BLURRING OF BOUNDARIES HE IS DOING ALL MEN A FAVOR. WHETHER FASHION??WHICH HAS HISTORICALLY TRADED ON ENTRENCHED NOTIONS OF FEMININITY AND MASCULINITY??REMAINS THAT COMMITTED TO ITS GENDER-BLURRING PATH REMAINS A MYSTERY AS MUCH TIED UP IN SOCIO-CULTURAL TRENDS AS DESIGNERS?? IMAGINATIONS. FOR A LASTING SHIFT IN DRESSING TO REALLY REGISTER THE MAN-SKIRT NEEDS TO LEAVE THE ANYTHING-GOES BUBBLE OF THE RUNWAY AND SAFE SHORES OF CELEBRITY PEACOCK-ERY AND HIGH FASHION ADVERTISING AND HIT THE POPULIST STORES OF THE LOCAL MALL. ,19575.0

THE ALLEGATION THAT PUTIN HAD USED HIS POSITION AS HEAD OF THE RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICE TO DESTROY VIDEO EVIDENCE OF HIMSELF HAVING SEX WITH UNDERAGE BOYS WAS THE CLIMAX OF AN INCREASINGLY BITTER PERSONAL FEUD BETWEEN ALEXANDER LITVINENKO AND THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT. SIR ROBERT OWEN A RETIRED HIGH COURT JUDGE FOUND THAT HIS PERSONAL ANIMOSITY COMBINED WITH LITVINENKO'S CONTINUED CRITICISM OF THE KREMLIN AND THE FSB OF WHICH HE WAS ONCE A SENIOR MEMBER WAS THE MOTIVE BEHIND HIS BRAZEN MURDER IN A MAYFAIR HOTEL VIA A POT OF GREEN TEA LACED WITH THE RADIOACTIVE ISOTOPE POLONIUM 210. \THE FSB OPERATION TO KILL MR LITVINENKO WAS PROBABLY APPROVED BY [THE HEAD OF THE FSB] AND ALSO BY PRESIDENT PUTIN\"" OWEN WROTE IN HIS REPORT PUBLISHED THURSDAY. \""THERE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY A PERSONAL DIMENSION TO THE ANTAGONISM BETWEEN MR LITVINENKO ON THE ONE HAND AND PRESIDENT PUTIN ON THE OTHER... MR LITVINENKO MADE REPEATED HIGHLY PERSONAL ATTACKS ON PRESIDENT PUTIN CULMINATING IN THE ALLEGATION OF PAEDOPHILLIA IN JULY 2006. THURSDAY'S ANNOUNCEMENT HAS BEEN TEN YEARS' IN THE MAKING. THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT REBUFFED MARINA LITVINENKO'S PLEAS FOR AN INQUIRY INTO HER HUSBAND'S ASSASSINATION FOR EIGHT YEARS BECAUSE DIPLOMATS FEARED THAT LONDON'S IMPROVING RELATIONSHIP WITH MOSCOW WOULD BE SEVERELY DAMAGED. A SECRET LETTER WRITTEN TO OWEN BY THE HOME SECRETARY THERESA MAY IN 2013 EXPLAINED WHY NO INQUEST HAD BEEN ALLOWED. \""IT IS TRUE THAT INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS HAVE BEEN A FACTOR IN THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION-MAKING\"" SHE ADMITTED. THE GOVERNMENT WOULD CHANGE ITS MIND A YEAR LATER WHEN RUSSIA'S CONFLICT WITH UKRAINE AND THE SHOOTING DOWN OF PASSENGER JET MH17 ENDED DIPLOMATIC NICETIES. THE EXPLOSIVE CONCLUSION OF THE REPORT WILL DO LITTLE TO CALM RELATIONS BETWEEN THE NATIONS EVEN THOUGH OWEN STOPS SHORT OF SAYING HE HAS CONCLUSIVE PROOF THAT PUTIN ORDERED THE HIT DIRECTLY. ALEXANDER LITVINENKO WAS NOT A POPULAR MAN IN MOSCOW. AS HE LAY IN WARD T16 AT UNIVERSITY COLLEGE HOSPITAL ON NOVEMBER 18TH 2006 TWO SCOTLAND YARD DETECTIVES ON THE GRAVEYARD SHIFT WERE ABOUT TO DISCOVER WHY. THE PALE PATIENT WHO WAS EXPERIENCING EXCRUCIATING BUT UNEXPLAINED PAINS HAD BEEN BOOKED INTO THE HOSPITAL AS EDWIN REDWALD CARTER. AFTER TWO WEEKS AT A SMALLER HOSPITAL IN A NORTH LONDON HE HAD BEEN MOVED TO THE CITY'S TOP MEDICAL FACILITY BY DOCTORS WHO COULD NOT WORK OUT WHAT HAD MADE HIM SO SICK. HIS SYMPTOMS WERE CONSISTENT WITH RADIATION POISONING BUT GEIGER COUNTERS SHOWED NO SIGN OF RADIATION. AS HIS CONDITION WORSENED THALIUM WAS ANOTHER SUSPECTED CAUSE BUT NO TRACE WAS FOUND. CLUELESS AS TO WHAT SUBSTANCE WAS GRADUALLY DESTROYING HIS BODY FROM THE INSIDE \""EDWIN CARTER\"" AND HIS WIFE WERE INCREASINGLY CONVINCED THAT HE HAD BEEN POISONED. THEY CALLED IN THE POLICE. DETECTIVE INSPECTOR BRENT HYATT AND DETECTIVE SERGEANT CHRIS HOAR ARRIVED AT AROUND MIDNIGHT TO ASK WHY THEY THOUGHT POISON HAD BEEN USED. THEY WERE STUNNED BY WHAT THEY WERE ABOUT TO HEAR. \""IN RUSSIAN I HAVE [ANOTHER] NAME: ALEXANDER LITVINENKO\"" CARTER BEGAN IN FALTERING ENGLISH. \""I AM FORMER KGB FSB OFFICER.\"" \""1997 I SENT TO TOP SECRET DEPARTMENT OF KGB MY MY DEPARTMENT HAS DUTY KILLING...

IT'S NOT RIGHT IS NOT JUSTICE.'\"" AND SO BEGAN LITVINENKO'S POST-FSB CAREER WHICH INCLUDED A SERIES OF LURID CLAIMS ABOUT RUSSIA'S MAFIA STATE. ONCE HE HAD ESCAPED RUSSIA AND WAS GRANTED POLITICAL ASYLUM IN BRITAIN IN 2001 HE CLAIMED THE KGB AND THE FSB HAD BEEN RUN THROUGH WITH CORRUPTION ACCUSED THEM OF MURDERS KIDNAPS AND DRUG-DEALING AND MOST EXTRAORDINARILY OF ALL STAGING A FALSE-FLAG TERROR OPERATION IN MOSCOW. HE ALLEGED THAT THE 1999 MOSCOW APARTMENT BOMBINGS WHICH KILLED AROUND 300 PEOPLE WERE MASTERMINDED BY RUSSIAN SECURITY FORCES IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY A FULL-SCALE WAR AGAINST CHECHNYA AND BOLSTER THE POPULARITY OF A YOUNG HARDLINE PRIME MINISTER CALLED VLADIMIR PUTIN. LITVINENKO WAS PAID A $2800 A MONTH AS AN INFORMANT FOR MI6??BRITAIN'S FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SERVICE. HE ALSO TOOK A SALARY FROM BEREZOVSKY THE MAN HE SAYS HE WAS ONCE ORDERED TO MURDER. THE OLIGARCH HAD ALSO FLED RUSSIA AND WAS GRANTED ASYLUM IN BRITAIN IN 2003. BEREZOVSKY WHO WAS FOUND HANGED IN MARCH 2013 PAID LITVINENKO TO HELP HIM RESEARCH AND WRITE ARTICLES AND PUBLICATIONS THAT WERE CRITICAL OF PUTIN. LITVINENKO ALSO OFFERED HIMSELF FOR HIRE TO PRIVATE INTELLIGENCE COMPANIES AND THE INQUIRY HEARD THAT HE HAD BEEN WORKING FOR THE SPANISH AUTHORITIES WHO WERE TRYING TO CRACK DOWN ON RUSSIAN CRIME SYNDICATES OPERATING IN SPAIN. IN THE SPRING OF 2006 LITVINENKO MET THE FAMOUS CAMPAIGNING JOURNALIST ANNA POLITKOVSKAYA IN A COFFEE SHOP IN LONDON. HE ASKED HER TO QUIT RUSSIA AND CONTINUE TO FIGHT AGAINST PUTIN'S REGIME FROM OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY. SHE DECIDED TO STAY AND WAS SHOT DEAD IN THE ELEVATOR INSIDE HER APARTMENT BLOCK ON OCTOBER 7. IN THE FOLLOWING WEEKS LITVINENKO TOLD A GATHERING AT THE FRONTLINE CLUB A FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT'S ASSOCIATION IN LONDON THAT PUTIN HAD ORDERED HER ASSASSINATION.

994,10177535.0,2016-01-22T05:01:00+00:00,YOU DAMN MILLENNIALS DON??T GET SOCIALISM,ONCE UPON A PRECIOUS OLD TIME SOCIALISM ACTUALLY MEANT SOMETHING DISTINCT FROM LIBERALISM. A SOCIALIST WAS SOMEBODY WHO WANTED THE STATE TO OWN THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION. THE BRITISH LABOUR PARTY SAY WAS GENUINELY SOCIALIST. ITS SOCIALISM HAD A SPECIFIC (AND SINCE ABANDONED) SOURCE??CLAUSE IV OF THE 1918 PARTY CONSTITUTION WHICH DESCRIBED THE NEW PARTY??S GOAL THUS: ??TO SECURE FOR THE WORKERS BY HAND OR BY BRAIN THE FULL FRUITS OF THEIR INDUSTRY AND THE MOST EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION THEREOF THAT MAY BE POSSIBLE UPON THE BASIS OF THE COMMON OWNERSHIP OF THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION DISTRIBUTION AND EXCHANGE AND THE BEST OBTAINABLE SYSTEM OF POPULAR ADMINISTRATION AND CONTROL OF EACH INDUSTRY OR SERVICE.? BACK IN THOSE DAYS WHEN BY TODAY??S STANDARDS MOST PEOPLE WERE POOR OR CLOSE TO IT THIS WAS ACTUALLY A PRETTY POPULAR POSITION. EVEN THE RULING CLASSES TOLERATED A BIT OF COMMON OWNERSHIP. FOR EXAMPLE IN LONDON BETWEEN THE WARS AS IN NEW YORK THE UNDERGROUND/SUBWAY SYSTEMS WERE TAKEN PUBLIC BECAUSE WHAT HAD EXISTED BEFORE WAS A MISH-MASH OF PRIVATELY OWNED LINES THAT DIDN??T COORDINATE SCHEDULES AND SO ON. AFTER WORLD WAR II WHEN LABOUR SWEPT IN WITH A CLEAR MANDATE THE PARTY REALLY DID SET ABOUT NATIONALISING-WITH-AN-S ALL THE MAJOR PUBLIC SERVICES AND INDUSTRIES. CAN YOU IMAGINE?! THE COAL INDUSTRY WAS NATIONALIZED JUST WRENCHED RIGHT OUT OF THE SCHEMING HANDS OF SEVERAL HUNDRED LITTLE (AND BIG) DON BLANKENSHIPS! THE UNITED STATES NEVER HAD A MAJOR SOCIALIST PARTY. IF YOU DON??T BELIEVE ME CONSERVATIVE READERS GO BACK AND READ SOME OF PREACHER AND SOCIALIST PARTY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE NORMAN THOMAS??S CRITICISMS OF FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT. ASPECTS OF THE NEW DEAL WERE OF COURSE QUASI-SOCIALISTIC. BUT REAL SOCIALISTS HATED ROOSEVELT MORE THAN THEY HATED THE REPUBLICANS IN A WAY: ROOSEVELT SAVED CAPITALISM. AND BROADLY SPEAKING SOCIALISTS ALSO TENDED TO BE PACIFISTS (EVEN AS THEY WERE MILITANT ANTI-FASCISTS). WELL TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT TIMES CHANGED. IN AMERICA WE HAD DEINDUSTRIALIZATION DEUNIONIZATION REAGAN IN BRITAIN THATCHER WON AND A FELLOW NAMED ARTHUR SCARGILL WHOM YOU OUGHT TO GOOGLE IF YOU??RE INTERESTED DID SOME TERRIBLE DAMAGE. THEN IN 1989 THE SOVIET UNION COLLAPSED. THROUGH THE 1990S THERE WERE STILL A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD THAT CALLED THEMSELVES SOCIALIST. BUT THAT BEGAN TO DWINDLE AND OVER THESE PAST 25 YEARS THE MEMORY OF THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN LIBERALISM AND SOCIALISM HAS DWINDLED ALONG WITH IT. THE EVANESCENCE OF THIS MEMORY HAS OF COURSE BEEN ACCELERATED BY THE ROUGHLY 89 KAJILLION HOURS OF AMERICAN TALK RADIO IN WHICH ANY MILDLY LEFT-OF-CENTER POLITICIAN OR PROPOSAL WAS REPREHENDED AS SOCIALISTIC. I SAY ALL THIS OF COURSE BY WAY OF TALKING ABOUT THE POPULARITY OF BERNIE SANDERS AND ESPECIALLY THE GENERATIONAL DIVIDE THEREOF. SOME OBSERVERS APPEAR TO BE A LITTLE SURPRISED THAT SANDERS THE CROTCHETY OLD GUY LEADS CLINTON AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE. A ROCK THE VOTE POLL OF MILLENNIALS THAT CAME OUT THIS MONTH SHOWS SANDERS LEADING CLINTON BY 11 POINTS AMONG VOTERS UNDER 35 I??VE SEEN OTHERS WHERE THE SPREAD IS HIGHER. IT ALL MAKES TOTAL SENSE. IF YOU??RE MY AGE YOU REMEMBER A TIME WHEN THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN LIBERAL AND SOCIALIST MATTERED. IF YOU WERE ONE OR THE OTHER AND LIVED IN A PLACE POPULATED BY MANY OF BOTH YOU GOT INTO LOTS OF BEER-SPITTLED ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE MERITS AND DEMERITS OF EACH. AND INCIDENTALLY YOU ALSO REMEMBER A TIME WHEN BERNIE SANDERS WAS THIS INTERESTING BASICALLY ADMIRABLE BUT ONLY-IN-VERMONT MAYOR AND THEN LATER THIS INTERESTING BASICALLY ADMIRABLE BUT FOR THE MOST PART INCONSEQUENTIAL BACK-BENCHING MEMBER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. BUT SAY YOU??RE 28 AND A LIBERAL. ALL YOU KNOW ABOUT SOCIALISTS IS THAT THESE EYE-BULGING RACIST VAMPIRES YOU SEE ON TV KEEP CALLING BARACK OBAMA A SOCIALIST. AND YOU THINK ??HEY I LIKE OBAMA SO SOCIALIST IS OKAY BY ME!? AND REMEMBER THAT IN HIS ONE BIG SPEECH IN WHICH HE DEFINED WHAT SOCIALISM MEANS TO HIM SANDERS??PROBABLY SOMEWHAT DISINGENUOUSLY GIVEN THAT HE CHOSE TO BE A SOCIALIST RATHER THAN A LIBERAL BACK WHEN THE DIFFERENCES WERE STARK BUT ALSO WHOLLY UNDERSTANDABLY??BASICALLY KINDA SAID SOCIALISM TO HIM MEANS THE STUFF THAT ROOSEVELT DID AND FREE COLLEGE AND SO ON. BESIDES ALL THAT YOU HAVE NO MEMORY OF A TIME WHEN SANDERS WAS A MARGINAL CHARACTER ON THE NATIONAL STAGE. FOR ALL OF YOUR ADULT LIFETIME HE??S BEEN A UNITED STATES SENATOR! THERE ARE IMPORTANT SENATORS AND UNIMPORTANT ONES SMART ONES AND DUMB ONES SOBER ONES AND DRUNK ONES BUT ALL THAT DOESN??T REALLY MATTER. ONCE PEOPLE HAVE TO CALL YOU ??SENATOR? YOU??RE A RESPECTABLE FIGURE. SO DIFFERENCES IN PERSPECTIVE ON SANDERS BETWEEN YOUNG AND OLD IS GRAND CANYON-IC IN SCALE AND IT IS BOTH IDEOLOGICAL AND PERSONAL. BY THE WAY CLINTON WALLOPS SANDERS IN THEIR OWN OLDER COHORT. IN ONE RECENT POLL CLINTON WAS LEADING SANDERS AMONG VOTERS 50 AND OLDER BY 40 POINTS 64-24. NOW OF COURSE YOUNG VOTERS ARE RESPONDING TO SANDERS??S POSITIONS AND HIS RHETORIC AND THEY??RE RESPONDING TO HIS THUNDERING ASSERTIONS THAT SWEEPING CHANGE IS A MATTER OF POLITICAL WILL WHICH OLDER VOTERS (THIS ONE INCLUDED) TEND TO DISBELIEVE. MY POINT IS JUST THAT THEY AREN??T PUT OFF FROM JUMP STREET BY THE S-WORD IN THE WAY THAT OLDER VOTERS WHO KNEW THE ORIGINAL MEANING OF THE WORD ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE. SO WE HAD THIS DES MOINES REGISTER POLL LAST WEEK SHOWING THAT 43 PERCENT OF IOWA DEMOCRATS THOUGHT OF THEMSELVES AS SOCIALISTS. NO AGE BREAKDOWN WAS RELEASED BUT I??D BET THE GENERATIONAL DIVIDE IS CLEAR. ODDLY ENOUGH ??LIBERAL? WASN??T A LISTED OPTION ON THE QUESTION JUST ??SOCIALIST? OR ??CAPITALIST.? SINCE NO ONE??S TALKING ABOUT THE STATE SEIZING THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION TODAY WHAT??S THE REMAINING DIFFERENCE YOU MIGHT ASK? FAIR QUESTION. THESE DAYS WITH SOCIALISTS HAVING DROPPED THE CORE THING THAT MADE SOCIALISM SOCIALISM IT??S PROBABLY MOSTLY A MINDSET AN EMOTIONAL-PSYCHOLOGICAL SENSE OF HOW CONFRONTATIONAL AND DISRUPTIVE AND ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT PEOPLE WANT THEIR LEADERS TO BE. THE ONLY DISTINCTLY SOCIALIST (AS OPPOSED TO LIBERAL) THING ABOUT SANDERS??S PLATFORM IS HIS CALL FOR MEDICARE-FOR-ALL WHICH DIRECTLY ECHOES WHAT THE SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY DID IN THE UK IN 1946. IN AN IDEAL WORLD MOST DEMOCRATIC VOTERS WOULD PREFER THAT SURELY BUT HOW MANY WILL SEE IT AS PREFERABLE TO THE CLINTON POSITION OF JUST SLOWLY AND ADMITTEDLY MUCH MORE BORINGLY BUILDING ON OBAMACARE? ART GOLDHAMMER HAD A TERRIFIC COLUMN AT THE AMERICAN PROSPECT THIS WEEK IN WHICH HE DIVIDED US INTO SAUSAGE PEOPLE AND EGG PEOPLE??THE SAUSAGE PEOPLE AFTER BISMARCK??S FAMOUS QUOTE KNOW THAT MAKING CHANGE IS HARD SLOW AND MESSY. THE EGG PEOPLE WANT TO BREAK EGGS TO MAKE OMELETS AND THEY WANT TO BREAK THEM NOW. HILLARY IS THE SAUSAGE-MAKER AND BERNIE IS THE EGGMAN. EGG-BREAKING IS A LOT MORE FUN HENCE ITS ATTRACTION ESPECIALLY TO YOUNGER PEOPLE. BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE OMELET. SOMETIMES PEOPLE FORGET THAT THAT PART CAN BE REALLY HARD. ,27985.0

CLINTON CRITICIZED SANDERS AS HAVING A POOR RECORD ON GUN CONTROL WHILE SANDERS WENT AFTER CLINTON FOR HER FOREIGN POLICY VIEWS. SANDERS WENT BACK TO THE 2008 DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY CONTEST TO CRITICIZE CLINTON ABOUT IRAN. \IF YOU THINK BACK TO 2007 DURING THE CAMPAIGN IN WHICH SECRETARY CLINTON RAN AGAINST BARACK OBAMA SHE WAS CRITICAL OF HIM? SANDERS TOLD CHUCK TODD ON MEET THE PRESS. ??A QUESTION WAS ASKED TO OBAMA THAT SAID ??WOULD YOU SIT DOWN AND TALK TO THE IRANIANS??? AND HE SAID ??YEAH I WOULD.?? POINT BEING YOU TALK TO YOUR ADVERSARIES. YOU DON??T RUN AWAY FROM THAT. SECRETARY CLINTON I THINK CALLED HIM NAIVE. TURNS OUT THAT OBAMA WAS RIGHT.\"" AT ONE POINT CLINTON DID DESCRIBE AN OBAMA STATEMENT ON DIPLOMACY AS \""NAIVE\"" BUT SANDERS IS LEAVING OUT IMPORTANT NUANCE THAT MISREPRESENTS HER POSITION AT THE TIME. HIS STATEMENT RATES HALF TRUE. THIS ALL STARTED AT A JULY 2007 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE THAT INCLUDED QUESTIONS FROM YOUTUBE USERS. ONE ASKED \""WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO MEET SEPARATELY WITHOUT PRECONDITION DURING THE FIRST YEAR OF YOUR ADMINISTRATION IN WASHINGTON OR ANYWHERE ELSE WITH THE LEADERS OF IRAN SYRIA VENEZUELA CUBA AND NORTH KOREA IN ORDER TO BRIDGE THE GAP THAT DIVIDES OUR COUNTRIES?\"" OBAMA WAS FIRST TO RESPOND SAYING \""I WOULD. AND THE REASON IS THIS THAT THE NOTION THAT SOMEHOW NOT TALKING TO COUNTRIES IS PUNISHMENT TO THEM WHICH HAS BEEN THE GUIDING DIPLOMATIC PRINCIPLE OF (THE GEORGE W. BUSH) ADMINISTRATION IS RIDICULOUS.\"" CLINTON ALSO ANSWERED THE QUESTION SAYING SHE AGREED THAT SHE WOULD APPROACH ADVERSARIES DIFFERENTLY THAN BUSH AND \""GET BACK TO DIPLOMACY.\"" BUT SHE DISTINGUISHED HERSELF FROM OBAMA BY SAYING SHE WOULD NOT NECESSARILY MEET WITH THESE LEADERS IN HER FIRST YEAR WITHOUT ANY PRECONDITIONS. INSTEAD SHE WOULD FIRST SEND ENVOYS. CLINTON??S \""NAIVE\"" COMMENT CAME THE NEXT DAY IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE QUAD-CITY TIMES IN IOWA. \""I THINK IT IS WRONG FOR ANY PRESIDENT TO SAY HE OR SHE WILL NOT TALK TO PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY??RE BAD OR EVIL\"" SHE SAID. \""BUT THE QUESTION WAS VERY SPECIFIC ASKING WHETHER EITHER OF US WOULD TALK TO A LIST OF LEADERS OF FIVE COUNTRIES WITH WHICH THE UNITED STATES HAS SERIOUS DIFFICULTIES WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR OF BECOMING PRESIDENT AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS IRRESPONSIBLE AND FRANKLY NAIVE TO SAY HE WOULD COMMIT TO MEETING WITH CHAVEZ AND CASTRO AND OTHERS WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR. AS I SAID LAST NIGHT THERE HAS TO BE A LOT OF DIPLOMATIC EFFORT.\"" SANDERS?? MADE IT SOUND LIKE CLINTON SHUT THE DOOR ON DIPLOMACY WHEN IN REALITY SHE WAS SUPPORTIVE THOUGH SHE ADVOCATED FOR A MORE CAUTIOUS APPROACH. IT??S WORTH NOTING THAT OBAMA DID NOT PERSONALLY MEET WITH IRANIAN LEADERS IN HIS FIRST YEAR. IT WASN??T UNTIL 2013 THAT HE SPOKE OVER THE PHONE WITH IRANIAN PRESIDENT HASSAN ROUHANI. OBAMA DID ANNOUNCE IN APRIL 2009 THAT THE UNITED STATES AND FIVE OTHER COUNTRIES WOULD ENGAGE IN TALKS WITH IRAN ?? THE P5+1 GROUP THAT EVENTUALLY NEGOTIATED THE NUCLEAR DEAL. FOR HER PART CLINTON AS SECRETARY OF STATE WAS PERSONALLY INVOLVED IN DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS TO INCREASE GLOBAL SANCTIONS ON IRAN THAT HELPED MOVE THE NUCLEAR DEAL FORWARD. RUBIO RECALLS REAGAN AND 1981 HOSTAGE RELEASE REPUBLICANS WEREN??T PLEASED BY OBAMA??S ACTIONS ON IRAQ. SEN. MARCO RUBIO SAID ON MEET THE PRESS THAT THE UNITED STATES SHOULD NOT HAVE MADE ANY CONCESSIONS TO IRAN. PART OF THE DEAL INCLUDED OBAMA GRANTING CLEMENCY TO SEVEN IRANIANS CHARGED IN U.S. COURTS WITH VIOLATING ECONOMIC SANCTIONS AGAINST IRAN. \""OUR ENEMIES NOW KNOW THAT IF YOU CAN CAPTURE AN AMERICAN YOU CAN GET SOMETHING MEANINGFUL IN EXCHANGE FOR IT\"" RUBIO SAID ON MEET THE PRESS. WHEN PRESSED ON HOW HE WOULD DEAL WITH COUNTRIES LIKE IRAN RUBIO SAID: \""WHEN I BECOME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OUR ADVERSARIES AROUND THE WORLD WILL KNOW THAT AMERICA IS NO LONGER UNDER THE COMMAND OF SOMEONE WEAK LIKE BARACK OBAMA AND IT WILL BE LIKE RONALD REAGAN WHERE AS SOON AS HE TOOK OFFICE THE HOSTAGES WERE RELEASED FROM IRAN.\"" RUBIO??S STATEMENT RATES PANTS ON FIRE AS A MISLEADING FRAMING OF HISTORY. REAGAN??S INAUGURATION IN 1981 MAY HAVE COINCIDED WITH THE RELEASE OF THE HOSTAGES BUT HISTORIANS SAY IT DID NOT CAUSE IT. INSTEAD THE IRANIANS HAD TIRED OF HOLDING THE HOSTAGES WHILE THE ADMINISTRATION OF JIMMY CARTER DID THE LEGWORK TO GET THE HOSTAGES RELEASED. (WE ASKED THE RUBIO CAMPAIGN FOR RESPONSE BUT DID NOT HEAR BACK.) IN 1979 ISLAMIC REVOLUTIONARIES OVERTHREW THE SHAH OF IRAN WHO HAD BEEN INSTALLED AND SUPPORTED BY SUCCESSIVE U.S. ADMINISTRATIONS. MILITANTS TOOK OVER THE AMERICAN EMBASSY AND HELD 52 HOSTAGES FROM NOV. 4 1979 UNTIL JAN. 20 1981 -- THE DAY CARTER PASSED THE REINS TO REAGAN WHO HAD DEFEATED HIM AMID WIDESPREAD PUBLIC DISAPPROVAL OF CARTER??S HANDLING OF THE CRISIS. BUT NEGOTIATIONS FOR THE HOSTAGES?? RELEASE STARTED WELL BEFORE ELECTION DAY. IN SEPTEMBER 1980 THE IRANIANS CONTACTED THE CARTER ADMINISTRATION WITH A PROPOSAL. THE IRANIANS BELIEVED THAT THEY HAD EXTRACTED MOST OF THE BENEFITS FROM HOLDING THE HOSTAGES AND FEARED HAVING TO START NEGOTIATIONS OVER WITH A NEW ADMINISTRATION ACCORDING TO HISTORIANS. ON THE DAY OF THE INAUGURATION CARTER INFORMED REAGAN AT 8:31 A.M. THAT THE RELEASE OF THE HOSTAGES WAS IMMINENT ACCORDING TO A CONTEMPORARY REPORT IN THE NEW YORK TIMES. THE HOSTAGES LEFT TEHRAN AT 12:25 P.M. AND REAGAN ANNOUNCED THE NEWS AT 2:15 P.M. AT A LUNCHEON WITH CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS IN THE CAPITOL??S STATUARY HALL. DESPITE THE SHOWY ANNOUNCEMENT SCHOLARS OF THE PERIOD SAY REAGAN DID NOT PLAY ANY SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN FREEING THE HOSTAGES. \""WELL BEFORE REAGAN BECAME PRESIDENT THE DEAL FOR RELEASING THE HOSTAGES HAD ALREADY BEEN WORKED OUT BY THE CARTER ADMINISTRATION'S STATE DEPARTMENT AND THE IRANIANS ABLY ASSISTED BY ALGERIAN DIPLOMATS\"" SAID DAVID FARBER AUTHOR OF TAKEN HOSTAGE: THE IRANIAN HOSTAGE CRISIS AND AMERICA'S FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH RADICAL ISLAM. NO REAGAN ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS PARTICIPATED IN THE NEGOTIATIONS FARBER SAID AND THE IRANIANS WAITED TO OFFICIALLY RELEASE THE AMERICANS AS A FINAL INSULT TO CARTER NOT BECAUSE THEY FEARED REAGAN. RUBIO??S COMMENTS ARE A CLEAR MISREADING OF HISTORY SAID MICHAEL GUNTER PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE AT TENNESSEE TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY WHO HAS AUTHORED SEVERAL PAPERS ON THE 1981 HOSTAGE RELEASE. \""IT IS CLEAR THAT SEN. MARCO RUBIO IS FALLING BACK ON AN EXAGGERATED URBAN LEGEND THAT THE ONLY WAY TO DEAL WITH IRAN IS THROUGH IMPLIED THREATS OF MILITARY RETALIATION AS PRESIDENT REAGAN SUPPOSEDLY DID\"" HE SAID. \""ACTUALLY SUCCESSFUL U.S. DIPLOMACY THEN AND NOW PLAYED THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ROLE.\"" """,3507.0

WITHIN MOMENTS OF THE CRIME??S REVELATION BY A STUNNED METROPOLITAN POLICE MEDIA OUTLETS OUTDID ONE ANOTHER TO PRODUCE ARCHITECTURAL DIAGRAMS OF THE TARGETED BUILDING DOWN TO THE BLACK SILHOUETTES OF UNIDENTIFIED MEN SHOWN ABSEILING DOWN EMPTY ELEVATOR SHAFTS AND CUTTING HOLES THROUGH SOLID CONCRETE WALLS. ONE REPORTER FOR THE BBC EVEN TAUGHT HIMSELF BASIC CLIMBING SKILLS AND FAMILIARIZED HIMSELF WITH A SPECIFIC MAKE OF CONCRETE DRILL IN ORDER TO REENACT THE HEIST??FOR USEFUL FORENSIC INSIGHTS OR MERELY FOR CLICKS IT WAS HARD TO SAY. THE CRIME ITSELF TOOK THREE YEARS OF PLANNING BUT JUST ONE LONG EASTER WEEKEND TO PULL OFF. WHAT WE NOW KNOW IN TERMS OF HOW THE HEIST OCCURRED COMES NOT ONLY FROM THE GROUP??S EVENTUAL CONFESSIONS??THEY WERE ARRESTED ONLY A MONTH LATER??BUT ALSO FROM POLICE RECORDINGS OBTAINED USING HIDDEN CAMERAS IN THE GANG??S PREFERRED PUB THE CASTLE IN THE LONDON BOROUGH OF ISLINGTON. DESPITE THEIR APPARENT CRIMINAL EXPERTISE THE GROUP STUPIDLY CONTINUED TO MEET THERE (AND TO OPENLY GLOAT ABOUT THEIR SPOILS) IN THE WEEKS FOLLOWING THE BURGLARY. THIS GANG OF PENSIONERS ONE OF THEM 76 YEARS OLD BROKE INTO THE UNDERGROUND VAULT OF HATTON GARDEN SAFE DEPOSIT LTD. IN LONDON??S JEWELRY DISTRICT. THEIR ESTIMATED TAKE WAS ANYWHERE FROM ?14 MILLION WORTH OF GEMSTONES AND CASH TO A TRULY EYE-POPPING ?200 MILLION. SOME OF THE BOOTY WAS LATER FOUND BURIED UNDER A HEADSTONE BUT ONLY ABOUT ONE-THIRD OF THE STOLEN GOODS HAVE SO FAR BEEN RECOVERED. TO ACCESS THE VAULT ITSELF THE MEN USED A DIAMOND-TIPPED HILTI DD 350 TO DRILL THROUGH NEARLY 20 INCHES OF SOLID CONCRETE. HILTI TOOLS ARE ALREADY KNOWN FOR THEIR COMBINATION OF RAW POWER AND SONIC DISCRETION: RECENT TESTS IN NEW YORK CITY HAVE FAVORED A MUNICIPAL SHIFT TO HILTI TOOLS FOR USE IN PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS PRECISELY BECAUSE THEY PRODUCE LESS NOISE. THEY ARE A LATE SLEEPER??S??NOT TO MENTION A BANK ROBBER??S??BEST FRIEND. THE OTHER DETAILS OF THE CRIME??THE CREW??S MISLEADING ORANGE WORK VESTS WITH GAS WRITTEN ON THEM THE HARD HATS THE PLASTIC GARBAGE BINS THE WALKIE-TALKIES THE CONCRETE DRILL??REVEAL THAT THE TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES OF BREAKING AND ENTERING ARE MORE OFTEN THAN NOT ALSO THOSE OF ARCHITECTURAL CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE. IN OTHER WORDS CUTTING THROUGH WALLS FOR REASONS OF PLUNDER AND CUTTING THROUGH WALLS FOR REASONS OF FIREFIGHTING OR ARCHITECTURAL RENOVATION ARE CONCEPTUALLY SEPARATE BUT TECHNICALLY IDENTICAL. AS I EXPLORE IN MY BOOK A BURGLAR??S GUIDE TO THE CITY WHAT ARE COMMONLY THOUGHT OF AS ??BURGLAR??S TOOLS???SUCH AS LOCK PICKS CROWBARS AND BUMP KEYS??ARE FAR SURPASSED IN BOTH EFFICIENCY AND FUNCTION BY THE OFFICIAL TOOLS OF BREAKING AND ENTERING USED BY MAINTENANCE CREWS SWAT TEAMS AND FIRE DEPARTMENTS. THAT IS THE EQUIPMENT ALREADY EXISTS FOR NEAR-UNLIMITED ENTRY INTO EVEN THE MOST SECURE ARCHITECTURAL STRUCTURES IN THE WORLD BUT THANKFULLY PUBLIC ACCESS TO THESE TOOLS IS CAREFULLY REGULATED. IN MANY CASES THEY REQUIRE TRAINING SO SPECIFIC THAT CRIMINAL SUSPECTS CAN OFTEN BE DEDUCED FROM LISTS OF QUALIFIED OPERATORS. SO WHEN A CONCRETE DRILL LIKE THE ONE USED BY THE HATTON GARDEN GANG IS FOUND AT THE SCENE IT IMMEDIATELY OPENS A TRAIL THAT CAN LEAD INVESTIGATORS BACK NOT TO THE CRIMINAL UNDERWORLD BUT INTERESTINGLY TO THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. INDEED LONDON POLICE WERE ABLE TO TRACE THE HATTON GARDEN GANG??S DRILL TO A THEFT AT A NEARBY CONSTRUCTION SITE. SEEN IN THIS CONTEXT BURGLARY BECOMES THE FLIPSIDE OF THE ARCHITECTURAL WORLD: A DARK TWIN TO THE WORLD OF BUILDING RENOVATION AND MAINTENANCE. WHEN NEWS OF THE CRIME BROKE GOOGLE QUERIES FOR THE HILTI DD 350 NOTICEABLY SPIKED??PERHAPS IMPLYING SOMETHING MORE THAN MERE IDLE CURIOSITY ABOUT THE CAPABILITIES OF A POWER TOOL. INDEED SUDDEN PUBLIC INTEREST IN A PREVIOUSLY OBSCURE CONCRETE DRILL SUGGESTS THAT THE PROMISE OF A NEW SUPER-TOOL ALLOWING ILLICIT ACCESS TO BURIED VAULTS WAS SOMETHING THAT IN HOWEVER METAPHORIC A SENSE YOU WANT TO LOOK AT THIS PEOPLE HAD BEEN HOPING FOR ALL ALONG. IT PROMISED A TRUE KEY TO THE CITY PUTTING YOU ALWAYS JUST ONE EXTENSION CORD AWAY FROM SECRET TREASURE. FURTHER THE HOLE ITSELF SO CLEANLY PRODUCED BY THE MACHINE??S DIAMOND-TIPPED TEETH LATER BECAME PART OF LOCAL MYTHOLOGY. THIS WAS TRUE TO THE EXTENT THAT AN ENTERPRISING JEWELRY DESIGNER CREATED A GOLD NECKLACE SHAPED LIKE THE HOLE FORMING A PORTABLE ENTRYWAY YOU OR YOUR LOVED ONE COULD WEAR LIKE AN AMULET. THE IDEA THAT A BANK HEIST COULD PRODUCE A GEOMETRIC SYMBOL SO RECOGNIZABLE AS TO BECOME ICONIC REVEALS SOMETHING ABOUT THE IMAGINATIVE HOLD A CRIME LIKE THIS CAN HOLD OVER A CITY. TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHY THE HATTON GARDEN HEIST HAS ACHIEVED SUCH WIDESPREAD EVEN GLOBAL RESONANCE IT??S IMPORTANT TO LOOK BEYOND THE INDIVIDUAL CRIME TO THE FABRIC OF THE CITY ITSELF. WHILE THERE IS AN UNDERSTANDABLE FASCINATION WITH THE GRITTY LIVES OF SPECIFIC CRIMINALS??NOT TO MENTION THE UNKNOWN TREASURES THEY SO MASTERFULLY LIBERATE FROM HIDDEN VAULTS??THE APPEAL OF A GREAT HEIST LIES IN WHAT IT TELLS US ABOUT THE CITY WHERE IT OCCURS. THERE IS A PECULIAR SUBTERRANEAN PULL IN LONDON FOR EXAMPLE A ??MANIA FOR BOREHOLES? AS WRITER IAIN SINCLAIR HAS REMARKED. ??THE EPIDERMIS OF THE CITY IS SO HEAVILY POLICED? SINCLAIR RECENTLY WROTE IN THE LONDON REVIEW OF BOOKS ??SO FRETTED WITH RANDOM CHATTER SO EVIDENTLY CORRUPTED BY A POLITICAL ASSAULT ON LOCALITY THAT HUMANS UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO ENGAGE IN A WAR THEY CAN??T WIN RESPOND BY VENTURING INTO FORBIDDEN DEPTHS.? FROM BILLIONAIRE HOMEOWNERS CONSTRUCTING MEGA-BASEMENTS??CELLARS SO LARGE THEY COULD ACCURATELY BE DESCRIBED AS CAVERNS??TO LONE ECCENTRICS LIKE THE MOLE MAN OF HACKNEY AND HIS WARREN OF HAND-CARVED SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGES LONDONERS SINCLAIR WRITES RESPOND TO THE CITY??S CONSTRAINTS BY GOING UNDERGROUND. ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING ASPECTS OF LONDON FROM BOTH AN HISTORICAL AND URBAN PERSPECTIVE HAS ALWAYS BEEN ITS SPONGE-LIKE POROSITY: THE PRESENCE OF TUNNELS SEWERS AND ANCIENT BASEMENTS WAITING JUST BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE CITY. INDEED LONDON HIDES AN UNUSUALLY INTENSE WORLD OF SECRET ARCHITECTURAL CONNECTIONS. WHETHER IT??S THE CITY??S ABANDONED TUBE STATIONS AND LOST RIVERS OR ITS ROMAN ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES AND MEDIEVAL CATACOMBS THE CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF THESE EXAMPLES IS THAT THE CITY SEEMS RIDDLED WITH SHORTCUTS PROMISING AN UNEXPECTED LINK FROM ONE BUILDING TO ANOTHER BEHIND THE NEXT BASEMENT DOOR OR A FORGOTTEN UNDERGROUND WORLD LURKING SILENTLY BENEATH THE NEXT MANHOLE. CONSIDER THE ABANDONED TUBE STATION OF KING WILLIAM STREET. AS TUBE ENTHUSIAST HYWEL WILLIAMS EXPLAINS ON HIS WEBSITE ACCESS TO THE STATION TODAY CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED BY WAY OF ??A MANHOLE IN THE BASEMENT? OF THE FAR MORE RECENTLY CONSTRUCTED REGIS HOUSE NEXT DOOR. IF YOU MANAGE TO LOCATE AND OPEN THAT MANHOLE SUBTERRANEA BRITANNICA ADDS YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF LOOKING DOWN AT THE ORIGINAL EMERGENCY STAIRCASE FOR THE TUBE STATION SPIRALING DEEP INTO THE DARKNESS. IT GETS STRANGER. AS ANTHONY CLAYTON EXPLAINS IN HIS BOOK SUBTERRANEAN CITY: BENEATH THE STREETS OF LONDON A UTILITY SUBWAY FOR THE CITY??S ELECTRICAL NETWORK CAN BE ACCESSED ??THROUGH A DOOR IN THE BASE OF BOUDICCA??S STATUE NEAR WESTMINSTER BRIDGE.? THAT IS IF YOU OPEN A DOOR IN THE BASE OF THE STATUE YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF AT THE START OF A TUNNEL THAT ??RUNS ALL THE WAY TO BLACKFRIARS AND THEN TO THE BANK OF ENGLAND.? THIS OF COURSE IS A PARTICULARLY NOTEWORTHY DETAIL FOR AN AMBITIOUS BANK ROBBING CREW. OR THINK OF THE ELECTRICAL SUBSTATION BURIED FAR BENEATH LONDON??S POPULAR LEICESTER SQUARE. CLAYTON WRITES THAT THE SUBSTATION CAN CURRENTLY BE ??ENTERED BY A DISGUISED TRAP DOOR TO THE LEFT OF THE HALF PRICE TICKET BOOTH A STRUCTURE THAT ALSO DOUBLES AS A VENTILATION SHAFT.? THE SHAFT LEADS TO A DEEP PEDESTRIAN TUNNEL MORE THAN A MILE LONG ??THAT CONNECTS IT WITH ANOTHER SUBSTATION AT DUKE STREET NEAR GROSVENOR SQUARE.? RECALL IN FACT THAT THE ELABORATE UNDERGROUND HEIST DEPICTED BY ROGER DONALDSON??S 2008 FILM THE BANK JOB SUCCEEDS AT LEAST IN PART DUE TO THE ACCIDENTAL DISCOVERY OF A MEDIEVAL PLAGUE PIT. THIS FORGOTTEN BURIAL CHAMBER EXTENDS RIGHT UP TO AND BELOW THE CONCRETE CLIFF OF THE BANK??S UNDERGROUND FOUNDATION WALLS??AND THE BURGLARS USE IT AS A STAGING GROUND FOR THEIR FINAL ASSAULT. THE UPSHOT OF THIS IS THAT IF YOU KNOW WHAT DOOR TO OPEN LONDON??S SECRET CIRCUITRY IS YOURS TO EXPLORE. OR TO BURGLARIZE AS THEY CASE MAY BE. THESE EXAMPLES ARE NOT ONLY FASCINATING ON THEIR OWN AS INFRASTRUCTURAL FACTOIDS OR AS URBAN ESOTERICA: THEY ARE ALSO EVIDENCE THAT THE LOGIC OF THE CITY OF LONDON IS ALREADY A LOGIC OF SECRET CONNECTIONS AND STARTLING PROXIMITIES. PUTTING THIS KNOWLEDGE TO WORK IN ORDER TO ACCESS BANK VAULTS OR TO PLUNDER SAFE DEPOSIT BOXES IS THUS IN SOME WAYS JUST AN EVERYDAY TEMPTATION ENCOUNTERED BY LIVING IN ENGLAND??S CAPITAL CITY??AS IF CUTTING HOLES THROUGH WALLS OR DIGGING TUNNELS BETWEEN BUILDINGS IS PERVERSELY ONE OF THE MORE EFFICIENT WAYS OF MOVING THROUGH THE CITY. THE FABRIC OF LONDON THEN IS ONE DEFINED BY PERFORATION: SERENDIPITOUS ADJACENCIES THAT ALLOW FOR MOVEMENT OUT OF SIGHT AND ACROSS PROPERTY LINES THROUGH WALLS FROM ONE BUILDING TO ANOTHER. AFTER ALL IN A CITY WHERE YOU CAN OPEN A DOOR IN THE BASE OF A STATUE AND WALK UNDERGROUND TO AN ENTIRELY OTHER NEIGHBORHOOD IN A SENSE WHY NOT DREAM OF BANK TUNNELS? FOR THE HATTON GARDEN GANG??INDEED FOR ANY PROSPECTIVE LONDON BURGLARY CREW??LOOKING OUT AT THE GREY METROPOLIS THEY TRAVELED THROUGH EVERY DAY THE CITY WOULD HAVE APPEARED AS A LANDSCAPE OF POTENTIAL HOLES AND TUNNELS IN WAITING OF IMPLIED ELISIONS AND IMPROVISED CROSS-ROUTES OF OPENINGS FROM ONE HALLWAY TO THE CORRIDOR BESIDE IT FROM ONE ROOM SEEMINGLY TO ALL THE OTHERS IN THE CITY. FOR THEM LONDON IS A PLACE WHERE PARALLEL LINES ONLY EXIST TO BE FORCIBLY FUSED TOGETHER. THE COMPLEX STRATIGRAPHY OF THE CITY ALREADY IMPLIES THAT THESE SORTS OF CONNECTIONS CAN BE MADE REAL THAT THEY ARE SIMPLY OF A PIECE WITH WHAT ALREADY EXISTS BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE METROPOLIS. JUMPING FROM ONE LEVEL TO ANOTHER IS JUST ONE DIAMOND-TIPPED DRILL AWAY. IF IN A CITY SO THOROUGHLY WORMED THROUGH WITH UNDERGROUND CONNECTIONS BURGLARS BECOME OBSESSED WITH CREATING THEIR OWN SHORTCUTS WHO CAN BLAME THEM? AND IF WE FIND OURSELVES CAPTIVATED BY THE HEIST PERHAPS IT??S BECAUSE WE??RE SEEING THE SPATIAL POSSIBILITIES OF OUR CITY FOR THE FIRST REAL TIME.

RELEASED THIS WEEK IN CALIFORNIA THE SMALL COCOA BUTTER-BASED INSERT IS BEING MARKETED AS A PAIN RELIEF OPTION FOR WOMEN WITH MENSTRUAL CRAMPS. WITH A MIX OF THC (CANNABIS??S PSYCHOACTIVE ELEMENT) AND CBD (ITS HEALING ELEMENT) THE TAMPON-SIZED SUPPOSITORY AIMS TO ??MAXIMIZE? MUSCLE RELIEF WITHOUT INDUCING A HIGH. IT??S AN EXCITING IDEA FOR THOSE WITH BAD PMS AND A POTENTIALLY LIFE-CHANGING ONE FOR THE ESTIMATED 5 MILLION WHO SUFFER FROM ENDOMETRIOSIS??A CHRONIC INCURABLE CONDITION RECENTLY HIGHLIGHTED BY LENA DUNHAM. IF SUCCESSFUL AT RELIEVING MENSTRUAL CRAMPS THE SUPPOSITORY COULD EVEN BE AN OPTION FOR REDUCING PAIN DURING CHILDBIRTH. IS A CANNABIS-INFUSED VAGINAL INSERT THE FUTURE OF WOMEN??S HEALTH? FORIA THE COMPANY BEHIND THE SUPPOSITORY MADE HEADLINES IN OCTOBER WITH THE LAUNCH OF ITS NOW WILDLY POPULAR MARIJUANA-INFUSED SEXUAL LUBRICANT (CALLED ??FORIA PLEASURE?). ITS NEW PRODUCT DUBBED ??FORIA RELIEF? IS SAID TO INDUCE RELAXATION RELIEVE BACK PAIN RELIEF AND REDUCE ANXIETY. FOR $44 USERS GET A FOUR-PACK OF SUPPOSITORIES CONTAINING 60MG OF THC AND 10MG OF CBD. ACCORDING TO FORIA THE SUPPOSITORY MUST BE STORED IN A COOL PLACE BUT CAN INSERTED ANYTIME FROM A FEW DAYS BEFORE MENSTRUATION TO DURING IT. THE MAKERS NOTE THAT TAMPONS CAN BE USED AT THE SAME TIME BUT THAT PAINKILLERS SHOULD NOT WITHOUT DOCTORS?? APPROVAL. IF ALL GOES WELL PATIENTS SHOULD FEEL PAIN RELIEF WITH 15-30 MINUTES AFTER INSERTION. SINCE THE PRODUCT IS SO NEW EFFICACY RATES ARE TOUGH TO GATHER. WITH MARIJUANA STILL ILLEGAL UNDER FEDERAL LAW THE FEDERAL DRUG ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT APPROVE MEDICAL CANNABIS PRODUCTS WHICH FORIA STATES CLEARLY ON ITS WEBSITE. WHAT??S LEFT THEN ARE TESTIMONIALS WHICH??FOR OBVIOUS REASONS??MUST BE TAKEN WITH A GRAIN OF SALT. STILL IF TRUE THE STATEMENTS ARE ENCOURAGING. ??I HAVE ENDOMETRIOSIS THAT RETURNED AFTER HAVING A PARTIAL HYSTERECTOMY? WRITES DESIREE MALIGRO. ??WHEN I HAVE FLARE UPS BESIDES EXCRUCIATING PAIN I LOOK PREGNANT AND THE INFLAMMATION AFFECTS MY BLADDER. FORIA IS ONE OF THE VERY FEW THINGS THAT BRINGS ME RELIEF.? ??I WOKE UP THIS MORNING IN A LOT OF PAIN DUE TO MENSTRUAL CRAMPS AND IMMEDIATELY USED THE PRODUCT? WRITES KELLY RAE STINNER. ??I HAVE ALWAYS REALLY STRUGGLED WITH THE INCREDIBLE PAIN OF CRAMPS AND THIS HAS DEFINITELY BEEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE METHOD IN RIDDING THE PAIN.? IF FORIA RELIEF IS SUCCESSFUL IN RELIEVING MENSTRUAL CRAMPS IT??S BECAUSE OF THE TWO CANNABINOIDS CONTAINED WITHIN IT: THC AND CBD. THE FIRST TARGETS THE NERVES TO ??BLOCK OUT PAIN? THE SECOND SUPPRESSES INFLAMMATION. THE LATTER ALSO ACTS AS AN ANTISPASMODIC PROPERTY WHICH CAN HELP TAKE CARE OF MUSCLE SPASMS THAT RESULT FROM MENSTRUATION AND OVULATION. THE PRODUCT IS UNIQUE??WHICH CONSIDERING ITS FOUNDER IS NO SURPRISE. UNLIKE MOST GANJAPRENEURS MATTHEW GERSON WASN??T A BUSINESSMAN HEADING FOR THE GREEN RUSH. ACCORDING TO AN INTERVIEW WITH VICE THE COLORADO-NATIVE WAS INITIALLY STUDYING TO BECOME A BUDDHIST MONK BEFORE A TED TALK INSPIRED HIM TO CO-LAUNCH THE CONDOM COMPANY SIR RICHARDS. BASED ON CHEMICAL-FREE PETA APPROVED CONDOMS SIR RICHARDS GAVE HIM THE ABILITY TO BOTH TRAVEL THE WORLD AND LEARN ABOUT THE VALUE OF SEXUAL HEALTH. IT WAS THIS KNOWLEDGE COMBINED WITH HIS SELF-PROCLAIMED APPRECIATION FOR MARIJUANA THAT LED TO THE CREATION OF FORIA. WHILE HIS PREMIER PRODUCT FORIA PLEASURE IS AVAILABLE IN MOST COLORADO AND CALIFORNIA DISPENSARIES CUSTOMERS CAN ONLY PURCHASE FORIA RELIEF BY BECOMING A MEMBER OF THE COMPANY??S CANNABIS COLLECTIVE. IN BOTH CASES A STATE-ISSUED MEDICAL MARIJUANA ID IS REQUIRED. WHILE STILL NOT IN STORES A LARGE PART OF FORIA??S CAMPAIGN REVOLVES AROUND THE HISTORY OF MARIJUANA AND FEMALE HEALTH. IN GERSON??S EYES THE SUPPOSITORY IS SIMPLY A MODERN WAY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AN ANCIENT MEDICINE THAT WOMEN HAVE USED FOR CENTURIES. ??THIS PLANT MEDICINE HAS A LONG CROSS CULTURAL HISTORY OF USE AS A NATURAL AIDE IN EASING SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH MENSTRUATION? SAYS GERSEN. ??OUR INTENTION IS TO SHARE THE POWERFUL MEDICINAL PROPERTIES OF THIS PLANT WHILE UTILIZING MODERN EXTRACTION TECHNIQUES.? HE??S NOT WRONG. ACCORDING TO A 2008 HISTORICAL REVIEW OF CANNABIS TREATMENTS IN OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY WOMEN MAY HAVE BEGUN USING THE DRUG TO TREAT CRAMPS AS EARLY AS THE 9TH CENTURY. A TRANSLATION OF AN ARAB TEXT FROM THAT TIME SAYS THAT WOMEN USED THE JUICE OF CANNABIS SEEDS TO ??TREAT MIGRAINE CALM UTERINE PAINS AND PREVENT MISCARRIAGE.? FURTHER EXAMPLES APPEAR IN TEXTS FROM THE 11TH CENTURY AND 13TH CENTURY IN PERSIA AND A CHINESE TEXT FROM 1596 WHICH SAYS WOMEN USED CANNABIS FLOWERS FOR ??MENSTRUAL DISORDERS.? PERHAPS THE MOST NOTABLE HISTORICAL EXAMPLE IS THAT OF QUEEN VICTORIA WHO WAS REPORTEDLY PRESCRIBED CANNABIS DURING HER MENSTRUAL CYCLE EACH MONTH BY HER DOCTOR SIR JOHN RUSSELL REYNOLDS. A 1928 PAPER FROM PHARMACOTHERAPUETICS MATERIA MEDICA AND DRUG ACTION ADDED EVEN MORE WEIGHT TO THE THEORY. IN IT THE AUTHORS REPORTED CANNABIS?? ABILITY TO ACT ??FAVORABLY UPON THE UTERINE MUSCULATURE? AND SUGGESTED IT BE USED TO COUNTERACT ??PAINFUL MENSTRUAL CRAMPS.? OVERALL THEY CONCLUDED THAT IT HAD ??PARTICULAR INFLUENCE OVER VISCERAL PAIN.? IN THE SAME PAPER THEY MADE NOTE OF ANOTHER POTENTIAL BENEFIT OF CANNABIS. ??A WOMAN IN LABOR MAY HAVE A MORE OR LESS PAINLESS LABOR??IF A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF THE DRUG IS TAKEN? THE AUTHORS WRITE. ??AS FAR AS IS KNOWN A BABY BORN OF A MOTHER INTOXICATED WITH CANNABIS WILL NOT BE ABNORMAL IN ANY WAY.? THE PRACTICE OF GIVING CANNABIS TO WOMEN IN LABOR APPEARS IN OTHER ANCIENT TEXTS AS WELL. DESPITE THE EXCITING NATURE OF THE STATEMENTS SCIENCE HAS YET TO CATCH UP TO THE CLAIMS. WITH MARIJUANA STILL ON THE DEA??S SCHEDULE I SUBSTANCE LIST IT??S NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR DOCTORS TO PERFORM THE RIGOROUS STUDIES NEEDED TO PROVE THAT CANNABIS IS ACTUALLY EFFECTIVE AT RELIEVING PAIN FROM MENSTRUATION OR CHILDBIRTH. WHILE MANY IN THE SCIENCE WORLD BELIEVE THAT MARIJUANA CAN RELIEVE PAIN FEW HAVE COME FORWARD TO SUPPORT ITS USE IN PREGNANT WOMEN. CURRENT RESEARCH ON MARIJUANA IN ADOLESCENTS SUGGESTS IT MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT YOUNG BRAINS WHICH IS LIKELY TO DETER DOCTORS FROM RECOMMENDING IT. BEYOND THAT ARE LEGAL IMPLICATIONS WITH SOME STATES SAYING PREGNANT WOMEN CAUGHT USING IT COULD BE CHARGED WITH CHILD ABUSE. GIVEN THE LACK OF RESEARCH IT??S NO SURPRISE THAT FORIA??S MAKES NO MENTION OF PREGNANT WOMEN IN ITS MARKETING. FOR NOW THE INVENTORS OF THE POT-INFUSED VAGINAL SUPPOSITORY WILL HAVE TO SETTLE FOR APPEALING TO THE NON-PREGNANT MASSES. ,12398.0

BUT BOURBON? FOR MOST OF OUR LIVES IT SEEMED THAT ONE COULD COUNT THE FLAVOR NOTES OF KENTUCKY??S FAVORITE SPIRIT ON ONE HAND MAYBE TWO: BURNT CARAMEL OAK VANILLA MAYBE A FEW OTHERS. THESE DAYS IT??S ANOTHER STORY ENTIRELY: TOP-END BOURBONS CAN BOAST OVER ONE HUNDRED FLAVOR POINTS. WOODFORD RESERVE ONE OF THE MOST COMPLEX AND BALANCED BOURBONS EVER MADE HAS OVER TWO-HUNDRED INDIVIDUAL FLAVOR POINTS. FOR THE FOLKS WHO MAKE IT HELPING YOU SORT OUT ALL THOSE FLAVORS??THE BLACKBERRY FROM THE ROSE PETAL THE ANISE FROM THE BLACK PEPPER??IS AS SIMPLE AS WELL INVENTING THE WHEEL. ??AS A STUDENT OF OUR INDUSTRY I HAD LONG ADMIRED THE FLAVOR WHEELS PUBLISHED BY THE WINE BREWING AND SCOTCH WHISKEY INDUSTRIES? SAYS CHRIS MORRIS MASTER DISTILLER AT WOODFORD RESERVE DISTILLERY. ??BUT I WAS SHOCKED THAT OUR INDUSTRY DID NOT HAVE A FLAVOR WHEEL. SOMETIME AROUND 2002 I DEVELOPED ONE FOR BOURBON BASED ON GOOD SCIENCE AND LABORATORY ANALYSIS OF MANY BOURBONS IN AN ATTEMPT TO GIVE PEOPLE A WINDOW INTO AN ENTIRE RANGE OF BOURBON FLAVORS.? MORRIS??S INNOVATION WAS IMMEDIATELY EMBRACED ACROSS THE BOURBON INDUSTRY WHICH WAS IN THE MIDST OF A KIND OF REVOLUTION OF REFINEMENT. ??YOU KNOW WHEN YOU ARE TASTING A FLAVOR BUT YOU CAN??T QUITE PUT YOUR FINGER ON WHAT IT IS?? SAYS TOM FISCHER FOUNDER OF BOURBONBLOG.COM. ??THE FLAVOR WHEEL HELPS US PUT IT INTO WORDS.? THE WOODFORD RESERVE FLAVOR WHEEL IS AS BALANCED AS THE WHISKEY ITSELF WITH FIVE PRIMARY SPOKES REPRESENTING THE FIVE AREAS OF FLAVOR IN BOURBON: WOOD GRAIN SWEET AROMATICS SPICE AND FRUIT & FLORAL. WITHIN EACH OF THOSE SECTIONS THERE ARE A DOZEN OR MORE INDIVIDUAL CONGENERS SUCH AS BLACKBERRY WALNUT PECAN BUTTERSCOTCH CINNAMON AND CLOVE. WHY AREN'T ALL 200-PLUS FLAVOR POINTS THAT CAN BEEN DISCERNED IN WOODFORD RESERVE INCLUDED? WELL FOR STARTERS IT??S A FLAVOR WHEEL NOT AN EYE CHART. ??IF I PUT ALL TWO HUNDRED ON THERE YOU WOULDN??T BE ABLE TO READ THE THING? SAYS MORRIS. PLUS ??A LOT OF THEM HAVE CHEMICAL NAMES THAT CAN BE CONFUSING FOR THE AVERAGE CONSUMER.? AT FIRST MORRIS FIGURED THAT HIS FLAVOR WHEEL??AVAILABLE FOR FREE FROM THE ITUNES APP STORE??WOULD HAVE LITTLE APPLICATION BEYOND ACADEMIC SETTINGS AND THE OCCASIONAL TASTING. THEN ALONG WITH WOODFORD RESERVE??S JAMES BEARD AWARD-NOMINATED CHEF-IN-RESIDENCE OUITA MICHEL MORRIS DEVISED AN INGENIOUS WAY OF OPENING UP THIS WORLD OF FLAVOR TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC BY PAIRING WOODFORD??S BOURBONS AND RYE WITH FOODS THAT NATURALLY ACCENTUATE THE SPIRITS?? INDIVIDUAL FLAVORS. THE BOURBON AND FOOD PAIRINGS ARE SOMETHING THE WOODFORD RESERVE FOLKS FEATURE IN THEIR WOODFORD COUNTY KENTUCKY DISTILLERY BUT CAN EASILY BE RECREATED AT HOME. A CHUNK OF PARMIGIANO REGGIANO WILL BRING OUT THE SPICE CHARACTER AS WELL AS SEVERAL WOOD NOTES. A FEW SWEETENED DRIED CRANBERRIES TAKES YOU DOWN A PATH OF FLORALS FRUITS AND ESTERS. TOASTED HAZELNUTS WAKE UP THE WOOD AND NUT FLAVORS. DARK CHOCOLATE CALLS UP BOTH SPICE AND THE SWEET AROMATICS. A BITE OF ORANGE BRINGS OUT EVEN MORE FRUIT WHILE A LITTLE BIT OF KENTUCKY SORGHUM PULLS UP YET ANOTHER ASPECT OF THE BOURBON??S WOOD CHARACTER. ??PEOPLE ARE SURPRISED BY THE FACT THAT WITH THE PROMPTING OF THE WHEEL AND THE FOOD THEY CAN REALLY TASTE THE COMPLEXITY OF THE BOURBON AND BECOME A KIND OF MINIATURE EXPERT? SAYS MORRIS. ??I DON'T THINK MANY PEOPLE HAVE ON THE TOP OF THEIR MINDS THAT A BOURBON CAN BE AS FRUITY AND SPICY AS WOODFORD IS. THAT IS A REAL REVELATION FOR MOST PEOPLE.? JUST LIKE YOU CAN TRACE YOUR FAMILY??S IMPRESSIVE CHEEKBONES TO YOUR GREAT-GRANDMA JUNE??S SIDE OF THE FAMILY EACH ONE OF THOSE FLAVOR POINTS CAN BE CONNECTED BACK TO A SINGLE ELEMENT OR COMBINATION OF ELEMENTS EMPLOYED IN THE UNIQUE PROCESS OF CRAFTING WOODFORD RESERVE. THAT BLACKBERRY FLAVOR? THANK THE FACT THAT THE CREW AT WOODFORD RESERVE OUTDOOR-AGE THE WHITE OAK IT USES IN THE BARRELS THEY MAKE IN THEIR COOPERAGE. THOSE APPLE NOTES THAT REGISTER ESPECIALLY STRONGLY IN THE NOSE COME PRIMARILY FROM FERMENTATION AND ARE FURTHER DEVELOPED AND EVOLVED DURING THE BOURBON??S UNIQUE-IN-THE-INDUSTRY HEAT-CYCLED MATURATION PROCESS. SIMILARLY THOSE CARAMEL FLAVORS CAN BE SOURCED FIRST TO MALT USED AS PART OF THE MASH (ALONG WITH CORN AND RYE) AND THEN TO ITS AGING INBUILT-TO-SPECIFICATION TOASTED AND THEN CHARRED WHITE OAK BARRELS. THE HIGHER-THAN-INDUSTRY-AVERAGE CONTENT OF RYE IN THE MASH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST OF WOODFORD RESERVE??S SPICE CHARACTER. ASK ANY BOURBON EXPERT WHAT MAKES WOODFORD RESERVE SUCH A SINGULAR EXPERIENCE AND THEY WILL TELL YOU THAT IT??S NOT MERELY THE SHEER NUMBER OF FLAVORS BUT THE WAY THEY BALANCE TOGETHER SO PERFECTLY: ??WOODFORD HAS SOME SIGNATURE CHARACTERISTICS THAT ARE ALL ITS OWN? SAYS BOURBONBLOG.COM??S FISCHER WHO HOSTS BOURBON TASTINGS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. ??IT??S A BOURBON THAT IF YOU PUT IT IN A BLIND TASTING YOU CAN ALMOST ALWAYS IDENTIFY IT BECAUSE IT IS SO SINGULAR. THERE IS A REALLY CARAMEL SPICY AND VERY LUSCIOUS FLAVOR TO IT. IT IS WONDERFULLY UNIQUE EXPERIENCE AND THAT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THE WAY THAT THEY MAKE IT.? ,17951.0

IT TURNS OUT THAT THE AUSTRALIAN-LED SEARCH FOR THE REMAINS OF MALAYSIA AIRLINES FLIGHT 370 HAS BROUGHT SCIENTIFIC REVELATIONS WAY BEYOND ITS PRIMARY PURPOSE??AS WELL AS ENCOUNTERING GHOSTS FROM ANOTHER AGE OF SEAFARING THE VICTIMS OF STORMS THAT MUST HAVE BEEN AS TERRIFYING AS ANY IN THE NARRATIVES OF JOSEPH CONRAD. WHEN THE OPERATION BEGAN TO FIND THE BOEING 777 NEARLY TWO YEARS AGO FEW COULD IMAGINE HOW FORMIDABLE THE PHYSICAL CHALLENGES WOULD BE. BY CRUEL CHANCE THE FLEET ASSIGNED TO THE SEARCH FACED ONE OF THE MOST REMOTE STRETCHES OF OCEAN IN THE WORLD 1700 MILES AWAY FROM THE NEAREST PORTS IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA IN A TRENCH THAT WAS AS MUCH AS 20000 FEET DEEP. MOREOVER THE OCEAN BED HAD NEVER BEEN MAPPED. NOW IN THEIR FINAL MONTHS AND WITH ABOUT 16000 SQUARE MILES OF OCEAN FLOOR LEFT TO SEARCH THE PRESSURE FOR A SUCCESSFUL RESULT IS MOUNTING ON SEARCHERS. AND AS IT DOES THERE ARE SETBACKS??LIKE AN EVENT ON JANUARY 24 WHEN A TOWFISH A TORPEDO-LIKE SONAR DEVICE BEING TOWED ON A CABLE COLLIDED WITH A GIGANTIC MUD-SPEWING VOLCANO. NEARLY 15000 FEET OF CABLE BROKE AWAY AS THE TOWFISH BECAME TRAPPED ON A RIDGE OF THE VOLCANO. TO SHOW THE CHALLENGES THEY FACE THE AUSTRALIANS RELEASED A COMPUTER-GENERATED THREE-DIMENSIONAL IMAGE OF THE VOLCANO??WITH THE STRANDED TOWFISH AND CABLE LYING ACROSS IT. FOR SURE THIS VOLCANO IS NOT SOMETHING YOU WOULD WANT TO ENCOUNTER ABOVE THE WATER LET ALONE IN THE DEEP. AT AROUND 4900 FEET IT??S HIGHER THAN THE MOST NOTORIOUS VOLCANO IN HISTORY VESUVIUS (4200 FEET). EVEN THEN ITS SUMMIT IS MORE THAN 1.3 MILES BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN. BEAR IN MIND THOUGH THAT THOSE VIVID COMPUTER-GENERATED COLORS ARE THERE TO CLEARLY CONVEY THE CONTOURS NOT THE REALITY. ALL THE IMAGES OF THE OCEAN FLOOR USED IN THE SEARCH ARE CREATED BY SONAR NOT BY CAMERAS WITH AN EYE. IN REALITY THIS MONSTER WOULD BE VIRTUALLY INVISIBLE IN THE DENSE AND SCUMMY DARKNESS OF THE DEEP. THIS SCIENCE IS SIGHTLESS. THERE ARE MORE MONSTERS FROM WHERE THIS ONE CAME FROM. ?Ÿ??GEOSCIENCE AUSTRALIA HAVE IDENTIFIED OVER 220 INDIVIDUAL VOLCANOES OF VARYING SIZE UP TO 1500 METERS HIGH AND 15 KILOMETERS IN DIAMETER? DAN O??MALLEY THE SPOKESMAN FOR THE AUSTRALIAN TRANSPORT SAFETY BUREAU TOLD THE DAILY BEAST BEFORE THE AREA BELIEVED TO BE THE FINAL RESTING PLACE OF FLIGHT 370 COULD BE SEARCHED BY SUBMERSIBLES IT WAS MAPPED BY BATHYMETRIC SONAR USING SCANNERS MOUNTED ON A SHIP??S HULL. WHEN THE WHOLE 46000 SQUARE MILE SEARCH FIELD WAS REVEALED IN RELIEF FOR THE FIRST TIME THE PICTURE WAS OF SOMETHING THAT EVEN A MOVIE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARTIST WOULD HAVE THOUGHT FAR-FETCHED. AT THE NORTHERN END OF THE SEARCH AREA WAS A SUBTERRANEAN MOUNTAIN RANGE LIKE THE ALPS THAT EXTENDS FAR WEST INTO THE INDIAN OCEAN. IN THE HEART OF THE SEARCH AREA AS WELL AS THE VOLCANOES THERE ARE DEEP RIFT VALLEYS WITH VERY STEEP GRADIENTS. ALTHOUGH LARGE PARTS OF THE SEAFLOOR ARE RELATIVELY FLAT THEY ARE COVERED IN A DEEP LAYER OF SILT THAT SHIFTS AROUND IN CURRENTS. ??CONDITIONS ON THE SEA FLOOR CAN MAKE PILOTING THE TOWFISH A COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT TASK? SAYS O??MALLEY. THE OPERATORS IN THE VESSELS ABOVE HAVE TO JUDGE WHEN TO RAISE OR LOWER THE TOWFISH TO AVOID COLLIDING WITH THE TERRAIN. NORMALLY WHEN THEY FEEL THE CONDITIONS ARE TOO CHALLENGING FOR THE TOWFISH THEY CALL IN AN UNDERWATER AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE (AUV). BECAUSE IT IS NOT ATTACHED TO A CABLE IT IS ABLE TO MANEUVER MORE NIMBLY IN DIFFICULT SPACES. BUT THE LOSS OF THE TOWFISH ON THE VOLCANO SHOWS HOW DIFFICULT IT IS FOR THE OPERATORS TO ??READ? THE TERRAIN. AT THE END OF FEBRUARY THE THREE SHIPS IN THE SEARCH WILL BE JOINED BY A FOURTH SENT BY CHINA AND EQUIPPED WITH AN AMERICAN-MADE TOWFISH AND OPERATED BY THE AMERICAN COMPANY PHOENIX INTERNATIONAL. THIS REPLACES A VESSEL THAT WAS PULLED OUT OF THE SEARCH LAST SUMMER WHEN MALAYSIA STOPPED FUNDING IT CHINA HAS SO FAR CONTRIBUTED $20 MILLION TO THE SEARCH. HOWEVER IT WAS NOT THE WEIRD WORLD BENEATH THE WAVES THAT TURNED THESE WATERS INTO A MARITIME GRAVEYARD. A MIGHTY FORCE OF NATURE WAS AT WORK ABOVE IN WHAT THE AUSTRALIANS CAME TO CALL THE GREAT SOUTHERN OCEAN.. BETWEEN LATITUDES 40 AND 50 DEGREES AIR DRAWN DOWN FROM THE EQUATOR TOWARD THE ANTARCTIC CONVERGES WITH THE EFFECTS OF THE EARTH??S ROTATION PRODUCING POWERFUL PREVAILING WESTERLY WINDS. CENTURIES AGO SAILORS CALLED THEM THE ROARING FORTIES. THEY WERE LIKE A KISS FROM THE DEVIL: ON THE ONE HAND THEY PROVIDED A ROCKET-LIKE BOOST FOR SAILING SHIPS ON THE MAIN SOUTHERN ROUTE BETWEEN EUROPE AND ASIA ON THE OTHER THEY COULD SMASH AND SINK A CRIPPLED OR MISHANDLED VESSEL. (IN THOSE SEAS A LOST OR DAMAGED RUDDER COULD MEAN DISASTER.) AND THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE WINTERS WERE HELL ADDING TROPICAL CYCLONES TO THE VIOLENCE. OVER THE CENTURIES HUNDREDS OF SHIPS FOUNDERED AND WERE LOST. TWO OF THEM HAVE BEEN FOUND IN THE SEARCH FOR FLIGHT 370. LAST MARCH THE WRECK OF A 19TH CENTURY CARGO SHIP WAS FOUND AND THEN IN DECEMBER SONAR ON A TOWFISH LOCATED A LARGER OBJECT ON THE SEAFLOOR. TWO WEEKS LATER WHEN AN AUV REACHED THE SITE AT A DEPTH OF 12800 FEET IT TURNED OUT TO BE THE WRECK OF ANOTHER CARGO SHIP 260 FEET LONG BUILT SOME TIME IN THE LATE 19TH CENTURY OR EARLY 20TH CENTURY. THE SONAR IMAGE OF THE WRECK WAS CLEAR ENOUGH FOR ROSS ANDERSON A MARITIME ARCHAEOLOGIST FROM THE SHIPWRECK GALLERIES OF THE WESTERN AUSTRALIAN MUSEUM TO BE ABLE TO DESCRIBE ITS DEATH THROES: ??IT IS SITTING UPRIGHT AND VERY INTACT? HE SAID. ??IT APPEARS IT IS COLLAPSING IN TYPICAL IRON SHIP FASHION WITH THE BOW AND STERN UPRIGHT AND INTACT AND THE SIDE PLATING COLLAPSING OUT TO STARBOARD.? THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF IDENTIFYING THE SHIP HE ADDED. ALTHOUGH THE SEARCH FOR FLIGHT 370 ATTEMPTS TO KEEP GOING 24/7 THE LAST SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE WINTER CAUSED FREQUENT DELAYS. FOR EXAMPLE THE AUV THAT FOUND THE LATEST SHIPWRECK HAD ONLY JUST RETURNED TO THE SEARCH BECAUSE THE CONDITIONS HAD BEEN TOO BAD FOR IT TO OPERATE SAFELY INCLUDING A CYCLONE THAT GENERATED 50-FOOT WAVES. SHIPS HAD TWICE TO MAKE URGENT RETURNS TO THEIR HOME PORT OF FREMANTLE WITH INJURED OR SICK CREW MEMBERS BECAUSE THEY WERE FAR OUT OF RANGE TO BE REACHED BY MEDIVAC HELICOPTERS. ALL THIS HAS SERVED TO REMIND US THAT IN MANY WAYS WHAT LIES BENEATH THE NEARLY THREE QUARTERS OF THE EARTH??S SURFACE COVERED BY THE OCEANS IS LESS WELL KNOWN (AND FAR LESS EASILY SEEN) THAN THE PLANETS OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. THERE SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING INNATELY DISTURBING ABOUT THE UNDERWATER VASTNESS OF OUR PLANET THAT DISCOURAGES EXPLORATION. (THAT IS UNLESS YOU HAVE THE RESOURCES AND CURIOSITY OF JAMES CAMERON??THE DIRECTOR OF TITANIC BECAME SO DRAWN TO THE DEEP THAT HE DESIGNED HIS OWN MACHINE TO EXPLORE ITS EXTREMES. HIS DEEPSEA CHALLENGER WENT NEARLY SEVEN MILES DOWN INTO THE TERRIFYING WORMHOLE OF THE MARIANA TRENCH IN THE WESTERN PACIFIC.) I HAVE ALWAYS FELT THAT PART OF THE HUMAN FEAR OF THE DEEP IS THAT IT INVOLVES GOING DOWN NOT UP. THE SENSATION OF SINKING OR DROWNING CERTAINLY AROUSES IN ME A PRIMAL HORROR. IN CONTRAST WE CAN READILY ACCEPT THE IDEA OF ??REACHING FOR THE STARS? AS THE ULTIMATE CALL TO OUR IMAGINATION AND EVEN PERHAPS OUR SOUL??TAKING US ON WHAT IS PERCEIVED AS A SPIRITUAL AS WELL AS PHYSICAL JOURNEY TO THE ORIGINS OF THE UNIVERSE AND OF LIFE ITSELF. ??REACHING FOR THE DEEP? JUST DOESN??T HAVE THE SAME ALLURE. IT SUGGESTS A WHOLE LOT OF RISKS THAT CHILL THE SPINE TOGETHER WITH A MENAGERIE OF STRANGE CREATURES THAT HAS EVOLVED TO SURVIVE AT DEPTHS THAT HUMANS CANNOT. THAT??S WHY YOU WON??T FIND DEEP-POCKET DREAMERS LIKE ELON MUSK AND JEFF BEZOS PUSHING TO A NEW FRONTIER BENEATH THE SEA RATHER THAN PLANNING COLONIES ON MARS. ALSO OF COURSE THERE IS A NEW INDUSTRY TO BE CREATED IN SPACE AND MONEY TO BE MADE. MARS MAY BE A FAR AWAY AND INHOSPITABLE PLACE BUT WHEN IT COMES TO SCARING THE BEJESUS OUT OF US IT CANNOT RIVAL THE FEARSOME MARIANA TRENCH. ,47166.0

IT??S PERHAPS THE MOST ANTICIPATED FILM OF THE 2016 SUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL AN APPROPRIATELY-TITLED CURIO CHRONICLING DEMOCRAT ANTHONY WEINER??S DISASTROUS 2013 MAYORAL CAMPAIGN. THE RECEIPTS ARE THE STUFF OF LEGEND: SEXTING CROTCH SHOTS AND THE FABULOUS SCREEN NAME ??CARLOS DANGER.? BUT THIS 90-MINUTE DOCUMENTARY BY JOSH KRIEGMAN (WEINER??S FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF) AND ELYSE STEINBERG PROMISED TO TAKE US BEHIND THE CURTAIN PROVIDING AN ALL-ACCESS LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED BEHIND THE SCENES OF THIS COLOSSAL TRAIN WRECK. IT??S HILLARY CLINTON??S CONNECTION TO THE DOC THAT HAS OF COURSE LENT IT AN EXTRA LAYER OF INTRIGUE. WEINER??S WIFE IS HUMA ABEDIN CLINTON??S LONGTIME ADVISOR AND CONFIDANT A WOMAN SO CLOSE TO THE FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE??AND CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE??THAT CLINTON ONCE REFERRED TO HER AS HER ??SECOND DAUGHTER.? AND PRIOR TO WEINER??S PARK CITY PREMIERE A FLURRY OF REPORTS SURFACED CLAIMING THAT WEINER AND ABEDIN WEREN??T ALLOWED TO SCREEN IT (NOT TRUE ACCORDING TO SOURCES CONNECTED WITH THE FILMMAKERS) AND THAT THE FILMMAKERS ALLEGEDLY TRIMMED SCENES THAT WERE UNFLATTERING TO TEAM CLINTON. ??MULTIPLE PARTIES WHO VIEWED EARLY CUTS OF THE DOCUMENTARY SAY CLINTON??S TEAM IS SEEN TRYING TO PRESSURE ABEDIN TO IMMEDIATELY CUT TIES WITH WEINER FEARING THE SCANDAL WILL HURT THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S BID FOR THE WHITE HOUSE? REPORTED THE HOLLYWOOD REPORTER. WHILE THE FILM CONTAINS PRECIOUS FEW DIRECT REFERENCES TO HILLARY THERE ARE SOME HILLARY-RELATED SEQUENCES IN THE LATTER PART OF THE FILM THAT MAY CATCH GOP SPIN DOCTORS?? EYES. WHEN THE WHEELS BEGIN TO FALL OFF OF WEINER??S 2013 MAYORAL CAMPAIGN IN THE WAKE OF YET ANOTHER SEXTING SCANDAL (FULL FRONTAL THIS TIME UGH) ABEDIN IS CAPTURED??THROUGH A SERIES OF SURREPTITIOUS PHONE CALLS??TAKING ORDERS FROM HILLARY??S RIGHT-HAND MAN (AND EX DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE) PHILIPPE REINES. IN ONE SCENE SHORTLY AFTER THE SCANDAL??S HIT THE NEWS WEINER AND ABEDIN ARE HUDDLED TOGETHER IN THEIR MAKESHIFT CAMPAIGN OFFICE. WEINER IS ADAMANT THAT ABEDIN JOIN HIM ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL BUT SHE RELENTS CLAIMING SHE HAS A PHONE CALL WITH ??PHILIPPE? THAT SHE HAS TO TAKE. ??ACT LIKE A NORMAL CAMPAIGN CANDIDATE??S WIFE? WEINER INSIST. ??YOU DON??T KNOW ANYTHING? MUTTERS ABEDIN BEFORE ROLLING HER EYES OFF-CAMERA. ?Ÿ IN ANOTHER ABEDIN REFUSES TO JOIN WEINER AND THEIR YOUNG SON??WHO IS GROSSLY USED AS A PROP CRYING WHEN THE CAMERAS FLASH IN HIS FACE??AS HE CASTS HIS VOTE ON THE DOOMED ELECTION DAY TELLING HIM SIMPLY ??PHILIPPE SAID DON??T.? WHETHER OR NOT THE CLINTON FOOTAGE-TRIMMING CONSPIRACY HOLDS WATER THE DOCUMENTARY WEINER IS A THOROUGHLY ENGROSSING TALE OF ONE OF NEW YORK CITY??S GREAT POLITICAL FARCES??IN OTHER WORDS THE VERY THING TED CRUZ WAS REFERRING TO WHEN HE CRITICIZED ??NEW YORK VALUES.? IT IS A TALE OF AN IDIOT FULL OF SCANDAL AND INTRIGUE SIGNIFYING THE SORRY STATE OF AMERICAN POLITICS. WEINER OPENS WITH A FITTING QUOTE FROM THE LATE GREAT MARSHALL MCLUHAN: ??THE NAME OF A MAN IS A NUMBING BLOW FROM WHICH HE NEVER RECOVERS.? THIS GOES DOUBLY FOR WEINER THE BROOKLYN BORN POLITICIAN WHOSE LEGACY MAY VERY WELL BE THAT UNFORTUNATE CROTCH SHOT (KRIEGMAN AND STEINBERG??S FILM COULD VERY WELL BE RETITLED THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE). ??I GUESS THE PUNCH LINE IS TRUE ABOUT ME? SAYS WEINER DURING THE OPENING SCENES. ??I DID THE THINGS. BUT I DID A LOT OF OTHER THINGS TOO.? HE??S NOT WRONG. WEINER WAS AT ONE POINT ON THE PATH TO POLITICAL GREATNESS. HE BECAME A DEMOCRATIC STAR AFTER THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM NEW YORK??S 9TH DISTRICT LASHED OUT AGAINST REPUBLICANS FOR OPPOSING THE JAMES ZADROGA 9/11 HEALTH AND COMPENSATION ACT??A RECENTLY-PASSED BILL THAT WOULD PROVE FUNDS FOR THE HEALTHCARE OF 9/11 FIRST RESPONDERS. VIDEO OF WEINER??S PASSIONATE SPEECH WENT VIRAL ELEVATING THE ALREADY POPULAR POLITICIAN WHO AT 27 HAD BECOME THE YOUNGEST COUNCILMAN IN BIG APPLE HISTORY. ON TOP OF THAT HE WAS MARRIED TO ABEDIN WHO THANKS TO HER CLINTON CONNECTIONS POSSESSED PLENTY OF POLITICAL CLOUT. BILL CLINTON EVEN OFFICIATED THEIR WEDDING CEREMONY (IN A POETIC MOMENT HE??D LATER OFFICIATE BILL DI BLASIO??S SWEARING-IN AS MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY). IT ALL CAME CRASHING DOWN IN 2011 WHEN IT WAS REVEALED THAT WEINER HAD BEEN SEXTING AND EXCHANGING NSFW PHOTOS WITH A GAGGLE OF WOMEN ONLINE. ADDING INSULT TO INJURY WEINER LIED ABOUT IT TO THE PUBLIC FOR WEEKS??AND TO HIS POOR WIFE. ??I LIED TO HER TOO? WEINER ADMITS IN THE FILM. IT WOULD NOT BE THE FIRST TIME. THE FILMMAKERS OF WEINER REALLY LUCKED OUT HERE TAGGING ALONG FOR ONE OF THE MOST SPECTACULAR POLITICAL CAMPAIGN IMPLOSIONS IN RECENT MEMORY. AT ONE POINT WHILE CAPTURING A VERY INTIMATE AND INTENSE POST-SCANDAL MOMENT BETWEEN WEINER AND ABEDIN KRIEGMAN ASKS ??WHY ARE YOU LETTING ME FILM THIS?? THE ANSWER AT LEAST ACCORDING TO THE FILM IS THAT WEINER IS A RELENTLESS NARCISSIST A MAN WHO??S NEVER MET A CAMERA HE DIDN??T LIKE. AND IT??S THIS DESIRE TO BE LIKED??BY THE MEDIA BY THE FILMMAKERS BY HIS CONSTITUENTS BY HIS BEVY OF SEXTING PARTNERS??THAT SEEMS TO DRIVE WEINER BOTH POLITICALLY AND PERSONALLY (HE ADMITS AS MUCH). AND THERE ARE MANY CRAZY MOMENTS IN WEINER. THE WACKIEST IS UNDOUBTEDLY A SEQUENCE WHEN ??PINEAPPLE???THE WEINER CAMPAIGN??S CODE NAME FOR HIS SEXTING PARTNER TURNED PORN STAR SYDNEY LEATHERS??SHOWS UP AT WEINER??S CONCESSION SPEECH/SHINDIG ON ELECTION DAY. ??I??M NOT GOING TO FACE THE INDIGNITY OF BEING ACCOSTED BY THAT WOMAN? ABEDIN TELLS WEINER BEHIND CLOSED DOORS. SO WEINER??S CAMPAIGN ADVISOR DEVISES A PLAN FOR THE COUPLE TO CUT THROUGH A MCDONALD??S INTO THE VENUE AS LEATHERS??CAMERAS IN TOW??SCAMPERS AFTER THEM. WHILE LEATHERS IS UNDOUBTEDLY PAINTED AS THE FILM??S OUTRIGHT VILLAIN IT??S ABEDIN WHO PLAYS THE ROLE OF TRAGIC HERO BRAVING EACH AND EVERY OUTRAGEOUS BLOW??AND WORRYING ABOUT THE MEDIA FALLOUT EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. THE FILM OFTEN CUTS TO HER DURING THE CHAOS TO CAPTURE THE LOOK OF SHOCK ON HER FACE TEARS WELLING IN HER EYES AS HER POLITICAL FUTURE COMES CRUMBLING DOWN. THE MORNING AFTER SCANDAL NO. 2 HITS ABEDIN IS CAPTURED STANDING IN HER KITCHEN. IT??S ONE OF THE ONLY TIMES IN THAT FILM THAT SHE SPEAKS DIRECTLY TO THE CAMERA. AS SHE MAKES HER MORNING COFFEE AND TAKES HER VITAMINS KRIEGMAN ASKS HER HOW SHE??S FARING. ??IT??S LIKE LIVING A NIGHTMARE? SHE SAYS FLASHING A PAINED SMILE. THROUGHOUT WEINER THE AUDIENCE WILL ASK THEMSELVES WHY THIS BRILLIANT BEAUTIFUL AND CALCULATING WOMAN HAS CHOSEN TO KEEP LIVING THIS NIGHTMARE. THE QUESTION REMAINS UNANSWERED. ?Ÿ ,16372.0

95,9591889.0,2016-01-04T05:01:00+00:00,WILL OBAMA BOTCH SYRIA LIKE HE BOTCHED LIBYA?,LIBYA IS A MESS. THE COUNTRY??S TWO COMPETING GOVERNMENTS??THE SECULAR-LEANING HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (HOR) AND THE ISLAMIST-LEANING GENERAL NATIONAL CONGRESS (GNC)??HAVE BEEN SQUABBLING OVER POWER SINCE JUNE 2014. BOTH SIDES HAVE RELIED ON A LOOSE ALLIANCE OF MILITIAS FOR SUPPORT BUT MOSTLY THOSE ARE TAILS WAGGING THE DOGS. THESE PARLIAMENTS LACK LEGITIMACY OR REAL POWER AND IT IS THE MILITIAS WHICH PROP THEM UP THAT ARE ACTUALLY CONTROLLING THE COUNTRY. ON DEC. 23 THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO ACCEPT A TRANSITION PROCESS TO IMPLEMENT A ??GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL ACCORD? EFFECTIVELY INSERTING A THIRD GOVERNMENT INTO LIBYA??S CHAOS. GOOD LUCK WITH THAT. SYRIA IS ALSO A MESS. THERE ARE DIFFERENCES OF COURSE BUT MILITIA RULE AND CLUMSY INTERNATIONAL ATTEMPTS AT SOLUTIONS COULD RESULT IN A CHAOTIC FAILED STATE MUCH LIKE THE ONE IN LIBYA. SO WE SHOULD LEARN FROM THE MISTAKES IN LIBYA AS THEY TRY TO DEAL WITH THE ONGOING CRISIS IN SYRIA. LESSON ONE: DON??T CREATE A POWER VACUUM IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR. WHILE THE CURRENT U.S. ADMINISTRATION MAY OR MAY NOT BE WILLING TO DEFER THE QUESTION OF SYRIAN PRESIDENT BASHAR AL-ASSAD??S TRANSITION THERE ARE U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE WHO MAKE IT CLEAR THEY WILL INSIST ON ASSAD??S DEPARTURE SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. IT IS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT ASSAD??S BRUTALITY THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE WAR??INCLUDING INDISCRIMINATE BARREL BOMBING OF AREAS WITH SIGNIFICANT CIVILIAN PRESENCE??MAKES IT HARD IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO IMAGINE A UNIFIED SYRIA UNDER HIS RULE. BUT IF THE ASSAD REGIME COLLAPSED TOMORROW SYRIA WOULD LOOK MUCH LIKE LIBYA DOES TODAY. WHEN THE STRONGMAN FALLS IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR??ONE IN WHICH BOTH SIDES ARE MADE UP OF A PATCHWORK OF COMPETING MILITIAS??THE RESULT IS NOT A STATE UNDER THE RULE OF LAW BUT A CONFLICT ZONE UNDER THE RULE OF THE GUN. JUST AS THE U.S. DID WITH LIBYA??S NATIONAL TRANSITIONAL COUNCIL (NTC) IT COULD BOOST THE SYRIAN NATIONAL COUNCIL (SNC) OR SOME OTHER TRANSITIONAL BODY. BUT DOING SO WILL NOT CHANGE THE FACTS ON THE GROUND. THE SNC LIKE ITS LIBYAN COUNTERPART DOES NOT CONTROL THE MILITIAS THAT ARE CURRENTLY FIGHTING ASSAD. IN POST-GADDAFI LIBYA THE VARIOUS MILITIAS THAT HAD FOUGHT TOGETHER AGAINST HIM DID NOT REMAIN UNITED UNDER THE NTC OR THE NEXT GOVERNMENT??S BANNER. INSTEAD THEY COMPETED WITH ONE ANOTHER AND THEIR CLASHES SNOWBALLED INTO LIBYA??S CURRENT CIVIL WAR. IN SYRIA SIMILAR CONFLICTS ALREADY EXIST AMONG THE SPLINTERED BRIGADES OF THE FREE SYRIAN ARMY THE VARIOUS SALAFIST MILITIAS AND OTHERS. IF ASSAD WERE TO FALL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WAR THIS CONFLICT WOULD INTENSIFY AND SPREAD TO AREAS SUCH AS DAMASCUS LATAKIA AND ELSEWHERE. IN THE LONG RUN ASSAD WILL NEED TO GO IF SYRIA IS TO BE UNIFIED AGAIN BUT HIS TRANSITION FROM POWER SHOULD NOT COME UNTIL THE COUNTRY IS MORE STABILIZED. THIS STABILITY COULD COME BY LOCAL CEASEFIRES LIKE THE ONE RECENTLY REACHED IN HOMS OR BY BROADER CEASEFIRES BACKED (OR IMPOSED) BY INTERNATIONAL POWERS. LESSON TWO: PEOPLE LIE??ESPECIALLY WHEN MONEY AND WEAPONS ARE ON THE LINE. WHEN THE U.S. OFFERED ITS SUPPORT TO THE NATIONAL TRANSITIONAL COUNCIL IN LIBYA BACK IN 2011 ITS MEMBERS PROCLAIMED THEIR BELIEFS IN DEMOCRACY AND PLURALISM ASSURING OUTSIDE BACKERS THAT THEY WOULD UPHOLD THESE VALUES. FIGURES IN THE NTC MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE INTENDED TO STICK TO THESE PROMISES BUT IN DESIGNING THEIR SECURITY FORCES THEY ESSENTIALLY PAVED THE WAY FOR RADICAL AND ANTI-DEMOCRATIC GROUPS TO RECEIVE STATE FUNDING AND WEAPONS. THE NTC CREATED THE ??LIBYA SHIELD FORCES? SYSTEM WHICH WOULD COME TO INCLUDE ISLAMIST MILITIAS SUCH AS THE FEBRUARY 17TH MARTYRS BRIGADE LIBYA SHIELD 1 AND OTHERS. DESPITE CLAIMING LOYALTY TO THE STATE THESE MILITIAS WERE (AND STILL ARE) LOYAL ONLY TO THEMSELVES SEEKING TO EXPAND THEIR POWER AND REPUTATION??OFTEN BY NEFARIOUS MEANS. IN 2014 A HANDFUL OF THESE GROUPS EVEN FORMED AN ALLIANCE WITH ANSAR AL-SHARIA LIBYA THE GROUP SUSPECTED OF CARRYING OUT THE SEPTEMBER 2012 ATTACK ON THE U.S. DIPLOMATIC POST AND THE CIA BASE IN BENGHAZI AND HAVE WORKED CLOSELY WITH THEM EVER SINCE. IN EARLY DECEMBER 2015 MEMBERS OF DIFFERENT GROUPS IN THE FRAGMENTED SYRIAN OPPOSITION MET IN A SAUDI-HELD CONFERENCE PLEDGING TO SUPPORT A ??DEMOCRATIC MECHANISM? IN SYRIA AND TO RESPECT THE RIGHTS OF ALL OF THE COUNTRY??S MINORITIES. UNFORTUNATELY THEIR DECLARATION ISN??T WORTH MUCH. THE CONFERENCE INCLUDED RADICAL SALAFIST GROUPS SUCH AS AHRAR AL-SHAM AND JAISH AL-ISLAM WHICH HAVE TRIED TO CONVINCE WESTERN AUDIENCES THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY MODERATE GROUPS AND HAVE CALLED ON WASHINGTON AND OTHER GOVERNMENTS TO ARM AND SUPPORT THEM. ONE OF AHRAR AL-SHAM??S LEADERS WROTE OP-EDS IN THE WASHINGTON POST AND THE TELEGRAPH TO THIS EFFECT?ŸTRYING TO WHITEWASH THE ORGANIZATION??S?ŸRADICAL IDEOLOGY?ŸAND VIOLENT ACTIVITIES. SO FAR THE WHITE HOUSE HAS IGNORED THESE CALLS BUT THERE ARE CERTAINLY CRITICS ARGUING THAT IT SHOULD EMBRACE THESE GROUPS. WASHINGTON SUPPORTED A LIBYAN GOVERNMENT THAT CONTRACTED ITS SECURITY TO RADICAL MILITIAS SUCH AS THESE. IT EVEN ENTRUSTED ITS OWN SECURITY IN BENGHAZI TO ONE OF THEM BEFORE THE 2012 ATTACK. GOING FORWARD THE U.S. SHOULD BE MORE CAUTIOUS IN INTERACTING WITH THESE GROUPS??DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY??NO MATTER HOW POLISHED THEY APPEAR. LESSON THREE: BEWARE OF RADICAL GROUPS CREATING STRONGHOLDS.?ŸSINCE AT LEAST THE 1980S?ŸISLAMIST MILITIAS HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF AND OPERATED FROM LIBYA??S UNGOVERNED AND UNDER-GOVERNED TERRITORY. THE MOST NOTORIOUS OF THESE AREAS ARE THE NORTHEASTERN COASTAL CITY OF DERNA AND THE ADJACENT GREEN MOUNTAINS??ESSENTIALLY LIBYA??S TORA BORA. SINCE 2012 GROUPS SUCH AS ANSAR AL-SHARIA LIBYA HAVE USED THIS REGION TO TRAIN FIGHTERS STOCKPILE WEAPONS AND CONDUCT OPERATIONS. ANSAR AL-SHARIA LIBYA NOT ONLY TRAINED ITS OWN FIGHTERS HERE BUT ALSO APPEARS TO HAVE TRAINED FIGHTERS WHO THEN WENT ABROAD TO BECOME COMBATANTS IN SYRIA?ŸOR CONDUCT ATTACKS SUCH AS THE JUNE 2015 MASSACRE IN SOUSSE TUNISIA. THE SALAFIST MILITIA??S FOOTHOLDS IN LIBYA ARE NOT UNLIKE THE TERRITORY IN NORTHWESTERN SYRIA CONTROLLED BY SALAFIST REBELS SUCH AS THE AL-QAEDA-AFFILIATED JABHAT AL-NUSRA AHRAR AL-SHAM AND OTHERS. THESE GROUPS DOMINATE THE CITIES AND COUNTRYSIDES OF IDLIB JISR AL-SHUGHOUR AND PARTS OF ALEPPO. IF THEIR CONTROL OF THESE UNGOVERNED AREAS CONTINUES THE THREAT FROM SYRIA COULD BE MUCH GREATER THAN THE THREAT FROM LIBYA??IN PART BECAUSE SYRIA IS A LARGER HUB AND ATTRACTS MORE FOREIGN FIGHTERS FROM ACROSS THE WORLD. BEYOND THIS IF SALAFIST MILITIAS SOLIDIFY THEIR CONTROL OVER THE TERRITORY ESSENTIALLY MAKING IT PERMANENTLY UNGOVERNED SPACE GROUPS COULD NOT ONLY TRAIN FIGHTERS AND STOCKPILE WEAPONS THEY COULD ALSO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF NORTHERN SYRIA??S PROXIMITY AND ACCESS TO TURKEY??MAKING THEM MORE MOBILE AND MORE INTERNATIONAL. THE STRONGER THESE GROUPS BECOME??MAINLY THROUGH FUNDING FROM SAUDI ARABIA QATAR AND TURKEY??THE HARDER IT WILL BE TO UNSEAT THEM FROM THESE STRONGHOLDS. IT HAS TAKEN A HARSH AND POLARIZING MILITARY CAMPAIGN?ŸBY LIBYAN GENERAL KHALIFA HIFTER TO TRY TO REMOVE ANSAR AL-SHARIA LIBYA FROM BENGHAZI AFTER IT TOOK CONTROL OF THE CITY IN OCTOBER 2014??A CAMPAIGN THAT HAS GONE ON FOR OVER A YEAR AND STILL HAS YET TO SUCCEED. WHAT KIND OF EFFORTS WILL BE REQUIRED TO FACE AN ENTRENCHED AL-QAEDA AND ITS ALLIES IN SYRIA? WASHINGTON SHOULD PRESSURE ITS ALLIES SAUDI ARABIA QATAR AND TURKEY TO STOP SUPPORTING THESE SALAFIST MILITIAS BEFORE THEIR HOLD ON NORTHWESTERN SYRIA IS SOLIDIFIED. LESSONS LEARNED? CRITICS ARE FRUSTRATED BY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION??S SYRIA POLICY ATTACKING HIM FOR INDECISIVENESS OR LACK OF WILL TO DEFEAT ASSAD BUT PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA SEEMS TO HAVE LEARNED FROM THE MISTAKES OF LIBYA. RATHER THAN A HEADLONG PURSUIT TO TAKE DOWN ASSAD OBAMA SEEMS TO BE MINDFUL OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF AN ABRUPT REGIME COLLAPSE. INSTEAD OF ARMING EVERY GROUP THAT MEMORIZES THE RIGHT TALKING POINTS ABOUT DEMOCRACY AND PLURALISM THE ADMINISTRATION HAS TRIED THOUGH IN SOME CASES UNSUCCESSFULLY TO LIMIT ITS SUPPORT AND EQUIPMENT TO CAREFULLY VETTED REBELS. THERE REMAIN AREAS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO IMPROVE BUT THE LACK OF U.S. LEADERSHIP THAT CRITICS CONTINUE TO DECRY MAY JUST BE HEALTHY SKEPTICISM AND CAUTION. BARRING SOME KIND OF MIRACLE THE SYRIAN CIVIL WAR WILL OUTLAST THE REMAINDER OF OBAMA??S ADMINISTRATION. ONE WOULD HOPE THAT THE NEXT ADMINISTRATION WILL BE AS CAUTIOUS AND REMEMBER THE LESSONS OF LIBYA. ,7374.0
407,9788336.0,2016-01-10T05:15:00+00:00,WAS PUTIN??S MEDIA CHIEF READY TO SNITCH BEFORE HE DROPPED DEAD? ,WHEN POLICE FOUND MIKHAIL LESIN DEAD IN A WASHINGTON DC HOTEL ROOM THE MOST INTERESTING QUESTION WASN??T THE CAUSE OF HIS DEMISE BUT WHAT HE WAS DOING IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE FIRST PLACE. THE FORMER PROPAGANDA CHIEF FOR RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN NICKNAMED ??THE BULLDOZER? FOR HIS HISTORY OF ROLLING OVER HIS OPPOSITION LESIN HAD BEEN UNDER SCRUTINY BY THE FBI AND THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT FOR POTENTIAL MONEY LAUNDERING AND VIOLATION OF CORRUPTION LAWS. LESIN WAS SUSPECTED OF HIDING ILL-GOTTEN GAINS IN NEARLY $30 MILLION WORTH OF LUXURY REAL ESTATE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AN ASTOUNDING SET OF ASSETS FOR A MAN SUPPOSEDLY COLLECTING A CIVIL SERVANT??S SALARY. HE??D ALSO BEEN CONSIDERED FOR SANCTIONS THAT WOULD HAVE PREVENTED HIM FROM OBTAINING A VISA TO ENTER THE UNITED STATES. SEN. ROGER WICKER A REPUBLICAN FROM MISSISSIPPI WHO HAS SPENT YEARS LOOKING INTO CORRUPTION AND HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES IN RUSSIA HAD ASKED THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO INVESTIGATE LESIN. IN DECEMBER 2014 THE DEPARTMENT CONFIRMED IT HAD REFERRED LESIN??S CASE TO THE CRIMINAL DIVISION AND TO THE FBI. WHILE OFFICIALS DECLINED TO SAY WHETHER THEY FORMALLY OPENED AN INVESTIGATION SEVERAL CLOSE WATCHERS OF LESIN??S CASE TOLD THE DAILY BEAST THEY THOUGHT IT WAS ALL BUT CERTAIN THAT HE WAS BEING PURSUED BY U.S. LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND IF HE WASN??T UNDER ACTIVE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION THE FBI HAD ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO CONSIDER OPENING A CASE THEY SAID. A BUREAU SPOKESPERSON DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE MATTER. SO WHY DID LESIN WHO WAS 57 TEMPT FATE BY ENTERING THE UNITED STATES THIS PAST NOVEMBER??Ÿ THE PURPOSE OF HIS VISIT WAS NEVER MADE CLEAR. BUT HE WAS STAYING IN A MID-RANGE HOTEL ON WASHINGTON??S DUPONT CIRCLE. WHILE NOT SHABBY IT??S DOESN??T SEEM THE KIND OF PLACE THAT ATTRACTS PEOPLE WHO BUY MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR ESTATES. IT DOES THOUGH OFFER A COMPARATIVELY LOW PER-NIGHT RATE PERHAPS MORE IN LINE WITH U.S. GOVERNMENT BUDGETS AND IS KNOWN TO HOST FOREIGN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND VISITORS ON EXCHANGE PROGRAMS. IT??S ALSO LOCATED A SHORT DRIVE FROM FBI AND JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HEADQUARTERS.?Ÿ?Ÿ THESE ARE THE BROAD STROKES OF LESIN??S CASE. AND IN SOME FOREIGN POLICY CIRCLES IN WASHINGTON??AS WELL AS IN RUSSIAN MEDIA??THEY HAVE FUELED SPECULATION THAT LESIN WAS MURDERED AFTER COMING TO WASHINGTON TO CUT A DEAL WITH THE FBI. LESIN CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE HAD A LOT TO SAY ABOUT PUTIN??S INNER CIRCLE--HE WORKED WITH AND REPORTEDLY OWED MONEY TO SOME OF THE MOST POWERFUL MEN IN RUSSIAN MEDIA AND FINANCE. AND HE WOULD HAVE HAD A POWERFUL INCENTIVE TO COOPERATE WITH U.S. AUTHORITIES NAMELY HANGING ONTO HIS SEVERAL MANSIONS IN LOS ANGELES WHICH POTENTIALLY COULD HAVE BEEN SEIZED. AT LEAST TWO OF THE HOMES ARE KNOWN TO BE OCCUPIED RESPECTIVELY BY HIS DAUGHTER AND HIS SON A HOLLYWOOD FILM PRODUCER WHOSE STAR IS ON THE RISE. ADDING TO THE MYSTERY THE PRECISE CAUSE OF LESIN??S UNTIMELY DEMISE HASN??T BEEN REVEALED. ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE BROADCASTING OUTFIT RT (RUSSIA TODAY) WIDELY SEEN AS A KREMLIN MOUTHPIECE REPORTED THAT LESIN DIED OF A ??HEART ATTACK? CITING AN UNNAMED ??FAMILY MEMBER.? BUT A SPOKESPERSON FOR THE WASHINGTON DC POLICE DEPARTMENT TOLD THE DAILY BEAST THAT LESIN??S DEATH IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION. AND ALTHOUGH A CORONER PERFORMED AN AUTOPSY NEARLY TWO MONTHS AGO THE POLICE AREN??T SAYING HOW HE DIED. THAT??S AN UNUSUALLY LONG TIME NOT TO PUBLICLY STATE A CAUSE OF DEATH. THE CONSPIRACY THEORIES ARE ARGUABLY WELL-FOUNDED BECAUSE IT WOULDN??T BE THE FIRST TIME SOMEONE WHO POSED A POLITICAL THREAT TO PUTIN WOUND UP DEAD UNDER UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES INCLUDING POISONING.?Ÿ LESIN WAS ALSO BEING SQUEEZED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. TWO YEARS AGO HE??D BEEN NOMINATED BY HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS FOR THE SO-CALLED MAGNITSKY LIST OF RUSSIAN HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATORS WHICH WOULD HAVE ALLOWED WASHINGTON TO DENY HIM A VISA AND SEIZE HIS ASSETS IN THIS COUNTRY. LESIN WAS NOT PLACED ON THE PUBLIC LIST WHICH CONSISTS MAINLY OF MID-LEVEL OFFICIALS NOT AS INFLUENTIAL AS THE FORMER PROPAGANDA CHIEF. BUT U.S. OFFICIALS MAINTAIN A CLASSIFIED ANNEX WHICH REPORTEDLY INCLUDES MORE SENIOR RUSSIANS INCLUDING THOSE CLOSER TO PUTIN. IT??S NOT KNOWN WHETHER MAGNITSKY WAS ON THAT LIST BUT ACTIVISTS LOBBIED HARD TO PUT HIM THERE. HE WOULD HAVE BEEN AN IDEAL CANDIDATE. NOT ONLY WAS HE ONE OF RT??S FOUNDING FATHERS CREDITED WITH CONCEIVING OF THE NETWORK WHILE WORKING FOR PUTIN IN ORDER TO COUNTER WHAT HE SAW AS ANTI-RUSSIA JOURNALISM IN THE WEST. (??IT??S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I WAS SCARED BY THE WORD PROPAGANDA? LESIN SAID IN 2007 ACCORDING TO RT. ??WE NEED TO PROMOTE RUSSIA INTERNATIONALLY. OTHERWISE WE??D JUST LOOK LIKE ROARING BEARS ON THE PROWL.?) LESIN WAS ALSO A LONGTIME PUTIN CRONY AND HE PLAYED A CENTRAL ROLE IN AN EARLY PROJECT BY THE RUSSIAN STRONGMAN TO GUT THE COUNTRY??S INDEPENDENT TELEVISION STATION NTV WHICH HAD AIRED CRITICAL REPORTS ABOUT GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION THE WAR IN CHECHNYA AND HAD BECOME A SOAPBOX FOR PROMINENT PUTIN CRITICS. WHILE LESIN WAS SERVING AS THE INFORMATION MINISTER RUSSIA JAILED NTV??S FOUNDER AND MAJORITY SHAREHOLDER VLADIMIR GUSINSKY.?Ÿ ??WHILE HE WAS THERE THE INFORMATION MINISTER MADE AN OFFER: GUSINSKY COULD HAVE HIS FREEDOM IF HE AGREED TO TRANSFER HIS MEDIA HOLDINGS TO GAZPROM THE STATE-OWNED ENERGY MONOPOLY? ACCORDING TO RUSSIAN JOURNALIST VLADIMIR KARA-MUZRA WHO HAS PROBED LESIN??S FINANCIAL AND REAL ESTATE HOLDINGS. IT WAS A NAKED POWER PLAY THAT THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS FOUND WAS POLITICALLY MOTIVATED AND AMOUNTED TO STATE-SANCTIONED BLACKMAIL. GUSINKSY DIDN'T END UP GOING ALONG WITH THE DEAL TO HAND OVER THE MEDIA COMPANY. BUT GAZPROM TOOK OVER NTV ANYWAY--BY FORCE--AND IN 2013 LESIN BECAME THE HEAD OF GAZPROM-MEDIA AN ACTUAL STATE-RUN MEDIA ORGANIZATION. RT WHICH REPORTED THE CAUSE OF LESIN??S DEATH BEFORE A MEDICAL EXAMINER HAD EVEN SEEN HIS BODY MERELY RECEIVES FUNDING FROM THE STATE. THE GAZPROM TAKEOVER HAS RAISED CONCERNS AMONG U.S. INVESTIGATORS THAT LESIN MAY HAVE COME BY A FORTUNE THROUGH ILLEGAL SEIZURES OF PRIVATE PROPERTY AND THEN LAUNDERED THOSE PROCEEDS BY STASHING THEM IN AMERICAN REAL ESTATE ACCORDING TO TWO SOURCES WHO HAVE FOLLOWED LESIN??S FINANCES AND ASKED NOT TO BE IDENTIFIED. LANDING LESIN COULD HAVE LED INVESTIGATORS TO OTHER EVEN BIGGER FISH. AS WICKER WROTE TO THEN-ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC HOLDER IN 2014 LESIN ??MAY ALSO HAVE CLOSE BUSINESS TIES WITH INDIVIDUALS SUBJECT TO U.S. SANCTIONS? AS WELL AS ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING?Ÿ BANK ROSSIYA WHICH IS CLOSELY LINKED TO GAZPROM AND THE BANK??S OWNER YURY KOVALCHUK A BILLIONAIRE WHO RANKS AMONG RUSSIA??S RICHEST PEOPLE IS REPORTEDLY CLOSE TO PUTIN PERSONALLY AND WAS SANCTIONED BY THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT AFTER RUSSIA INVADED CRIMEA. IF LESIN WERE FOUND TO BE VIOLATING U.S. MONEY LAUNDERING LAWS IT COULD PROVIDE A RARE OPPORTUNITY TO SNARE A SENIOR PUTIN AIDE. AFTER WICKER PRESSED THE ISSUE RELYING IN PART ON PUBLIC PROPERTY RECORDS THAT CLEARLY LINKED THE L.A. MANSIONS TO LESIN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT CONSIDERED WHETHER TO GO AFTER HIM. FOLLOWING THE NEWS OF HIS DEATH THE KREMLIN ISSUED A STATEMENT ON BEHALF OF PUTIN NOTING ??THE PRESIDENT HAS A HIGH APPRECIATION FOR MIKHAIL LESIN??S MASSIVE CONTRIBUTION TO THE CREATION OF MODERN RUSSIAN MASS MEDIA.? BUT HAVING LESIN AS AN INFORMANT WOULD BEEN A BIG CONTRIBUTION TO U.S. LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INTELLIGENCE.

ON MARCH 13 1982 CARLOS CHEN OSORIO WATCHED FROM THE MOUNTAINS IN HIDING ABOVE HIS HOMETOWN IN RIO NEGRO WHILE THE MILITARY MASSACRED 177 WOMEN AND CHILDREN INCLUDING OSORIO??S PREGNANT WIFE AND THEIR CHILDREN. EVEN THOUGH HE HAS TOLD THE STORY FOR THREE DECADES TEARS OFTEN COME TO HIS EYES WHEN HE REMEMBERS. ??AS LONG AS GOD LETS ME I WILL CONTINUE TELLING MY STORY SO THAT WHAT HAPPENED IS NEVER REPEATED? OSORIO TOLD THE DAILY BEAST IN THIS PREDOMINANTLY MAYAN TOWN IN MOUNTAINOUS BAJA VERAPAZ GUATEMALA. OSORIO LIKE MANY OTHERS SEEKING JUSTICE THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD FIND SOME AT THE GENOCIDE TRIAL OF FORMER GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT EFRA??N R??OS MONTT WHO WAS ONCE THE DARLING OF POLITICALLY ACTIVE CONSERVATIVE EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANS IN THE U.S. (HE??D BEEN ??BORN AGAIN? AFTER ALL) AND OF THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION. (WHILE MONTT WAGED A CAMPAIGN TO OBLITERATE MAYAN VILLAGERS WHO MIGHT SUPPORT A GUERRILLA INSURGENCY REAGAN MADE THE NOW INFAMOUS REMARK THAT HE??D BEEN GIVEN ??A BUM RAP.? AS IT HAPPENED R??OS MONTT ONLY HELD OFFICE FOR 17 MONTHS FROM 1982 TO 1983 BUT DURING THAT TIME HE INTENSIFIED WHAT HAD ALREADY BEEN A FEROCIOUS COUNTERINSURGENCY CAMPAIGN WAGED BY HIS PREDECESSORS. IN MAY 2013 RIOS MONTT WAS SENTENCED TO 80 YEARS FOR GENOCIDE AND CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY. BUT THE VERDICT WAS OVERTURNED BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT JUST 10 DAYS LATER. AND NOW THE HOPE FOR JUSTICE FURTHER DWINDLES AT THE NEWS THE TRIAL WILL BE POSTPONED BECAUSE OF THE 89-YEAR-OLD R??OS MONTT??S DETERIORATING HEALTH. WHATEVER THE VERDICT THE TRIAL EXPOSED THE BRUTAL MURDERS SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND PILLAGING OF GUATEMALAN VILLAGES UNDER R??OS MONTT. CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS AND FORENSIC SCIENCE HAVE EXPOSED HIS ORDERS TO CARRY OUT MASSACRES U.S. COMPLICITY IN HIS TACTICS AND THE HORRIFIC RESULTS. ??TRIALS ARE REALLY GOOD FOR BRINGING OUT A TRUE HISTORICAL NARRATIVE? SAID PAMELA YATES A DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER WHO HAS COVERED THE R??OS MONTT TRIAL AND THE GUATEMALAN CIVIL WAR THAT ENDED IN 1996. MANY GUATEMALANS ONLY STARTED TO ACCEPT THIS HARSH TRUTH FROM THE COUNTRY??S PAST WHEN EVIDENCE WAS PRESENTED IN COURT. OSORIO RELIVES THE GENOCIDE ALMOST EVERY DAY. BUT SOME DAYS HE PRETENDS IT NEVER HAPPENED AND INSTEAD IMAGINES A PEACEFUL NORMAL LIFE IN HIS HOUSE THAT WAS BURNED DOWN. THERE HE SITS WITH HIS WIFE OF NEARLY 40 YEARS AS THEY WATCH THEIR GRANDCHILDREN PLAY. IT IS AN IMAGINARY WORLD HE HAS CREATED??A WORLD WHERE HIS FAMILY FLED TO THE MOUNTAINS WITH HIM WHERE HE DIDN??T SEE HIS WIFE??S HAIR RIBBON IN A HEAP OF INDISTINGUISHABLE DEAD BODIES WHERE HIS CHILDREN GREW UP TO BE SUCCESSFUL YOUNG PROFESSIONALS. THEN HE SNAPS BACK TO REALITY. ??HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO ACCUSE CHILDREN OF BEING GUERRILLAS?? OSORIO SAID. ??IF THERE WERE GUERRILLAS [IN RIO NEGRO] THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A CONFRONTATION.? GENOCIDE IS THE ??INTENT TO DESTROY IN WHOLE OR IN PART A NATIONAL ETHNIC RACIAL OR RELIGIOUS GROUP? THROUGH VARIOUS TYPES OF PHYSICAL REPRESSION. A 1998 TRUTH COMMISSION IN GUATEMALA LOOKING AT THE EVIDENCE DECIDED GENOCIDE WAS THE RIGHT WORD TO CATEGORIZE THE ETHNICALLY MOTIVATED MASSACRES AGAINST MAYANS DURING THE CIVIL WAR. YATES EXPOSED THE WIDESPREAD AND SYSTEMATIC NATURE OF VIOLENCE IN A 1983 DOCUMENTARY ??WHEN THE MOUNTAINS TREMBLE.? IN THE FILM NOBEL PEACE PRIZE RECIPIENT RIGOBERTA MENCHU TUM A MAYAN WOMAN NARRATES THE STORY OF ABUSE AND SURVIVAL OF INDIGENOUS GROUPS IN GUATEMALA A STORY THAT THE GOVERNMENT REPRESSED THROUGH POLITICAL TERROR. ??THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA IN GUATEMALA WAS SILENCED? YATES SAID. ??IT WAS NOT REPORTING WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE HIGHLANDS. IT COULDN??T. IT WOULDN??T.? THROUGH INTERVIEWS AND VISITS TO PREDOMINANTLY INDIGENOUS AREAS YATES DOCUMENTED EVIDENCE OF BRUTAL MASSACRES AGAINST AN UNARMED CIVILIAN POPULATION. MILITARY FORCES OFTEN CONFLATED CIVILIANS WITH COMMUNISTS IN AREAS MARKED AS ??RED ZONES? WHERE GUERRILLAS HAD CONTROL YATES LEARNED BY GOING ON MILITARY PATROLS. CLASSIFIED MILITARY DOCUMENTS LATER CONFIRMED THESE ATTACKS WERE PART OF SYSTEMATIC VIOLENCE AGAINST INDIGENOUS MAYANS ORDERED BY THE HIGHEST COMMANDERS. AS WASHINGTON LOOKED AT THESE DEVELOPMENTS THE BRUTALITY WAS SHROUDED BY COLD WAR RHETORIC THAT PRESENTED THE WAR AS NOTHING MORE OR LESS THAN A CONFLICT BETWEEN CUBAN-BACKED LEFTISTS AND A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT. ??THE NATIONAL SECURITY OF ALL AMERICANS IS AT STAKE IN CENTRAL AMERICA? REAGAN SAID IN A 1983 SPEECH ASKING CONGRESS TO REOPEN AID TO THE REGION SO ??THE PEOPLE OF CENTRAL AMERICA CAN HOLD THE LINE AGAINST EXTERNALLY SUPPORTED AGGRESSION.? JIMMY CARTER HAD PREVIOUSLY CUT OFF MILITARY TO GUATEMALA IN 1977 FOR SERIOUS HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. BUT REAGAN BYPASSED CONGRESSIONAL RESTRICTIONS TO SEND AID TO RIOS MONTT AS EARLY AS DECEMBER 1982. THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION CONTINUALLY PETITIONED CONGRESS TO REOPEN AID TO CENTRAL AMERICA INCLUDING GUATEMALA. EVEN WITHOUT CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL THE U.S. COVERTLY SENT MILITARY SUPPLIES MOST IMPORTANTLY HELICOPTERS TO CARRY OUT A SCORCHED EARTH POLICY THROUGH PROXIES SUCH AS ISRAEL AND OTHER ALLIES. ??WHEN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT SENDS AID TO GUATEMALA WHETHER IT??S MILITARY AID ADVISORS OR ECONOMIC AID THEY MUST UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE CONTRIBUTING DIRECTLY TO A WORSENING BLOODBATH? SAID MENCHU IN ??WHEN THE MOUNTAINS TREMBLE.? UNDER R??OS MONTT??S COUNTERINSURGENCY PLAN OPERATION SOFIA THE GUATEMALAN ARMY ATTACKED MORE THAN 600 VILLAGES AND AN ESTIMATED 70000 PEOPLE WERE KILLED OR DISAPPEARED.

HOWEVER FORMER PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON PREVIOUSLY ATTEMPTED TO ATONE FOR PAST ERRORS IN A 1999 VISIT TO GUATEMALA WHEN HE APOLOGIZED FOR THE U.S. INVOLVEMENT IN THE CONFLICT. ??AN APOLOGY IS A BEGINNING BUT I DON??T THINK IT??S ENOUGH? SAID YATES. ??HOW CAN YOU BRING BACK PEOPLE WHO WERE KILLED?

SCHOOLS IN THE AREA HAVE BEEN CLOSED FOR THREE DAYS IN A ROW AND CHILDREN ARE BEING TESTED FOR LEAD POISONING. OVER THE SUMMER SOME SEVEN OUT OF 20 HOMES IN AN AREA OFTEN TESTED WERE FOUND TO HAVE EXCESSIVE LEAD LEVELS AND THE OHIO ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY IS ACCUSING THE MANAGER OF THE VILLAGE??S WATER SYSTEM OF FAILING TO NOTIFY PEOPLE WITHIN THE REQUIRED 60 DAYS OF THE POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS WATER. THE MANAGER JAMES BATES IS ACCUSED OF FILING MISLEADING AND INACCURATE REPORTS THAT DID NOT PROPERLY ADDRESS THE SITUATION.

AND LIKE MOST CELEBRITY SPLITS IT WAS MESSY. ??SO I GUESS THE BROMANCE IS OVER? DONALD TRUMP CONCLUDED IN AN INTERVIEW ON CNN AFTER THE REPUBLICAN DEBATE REFLECTING ON A RELATIONSHIP THAT WAS THAT MIGHT NEVER BE THE SAME. BEFORE THINGS FELL APART FOR THE STAR-CROSSED CANDIDATES TED CRUZ AND TRUMP LONG HAD A NON-AGGRESSION PACT. IT WAS SWEET CRUZ DEFENDED FOR TRUMP??S OUTLANDISH STATEMENTS WHEN NO OTHER REPUBLICAN WOULD AND TRUMP STAUNCHLY REFUSED TO TARGET CRUZ BECAUSE OF THAT GOODWILL. TRUMP HAS STARTED TO QUESTION WHETHER THE CANADIAN-BORN CRUZ IS CONSTITUTIONALLY ELIGIBLE FOR THE PRESIDENCY BUT EVEN THAT ATTACK WAS DELIVERED MUCH MORE POLITELY THAN ANYTHING HE??S SAID TO SOMEONE LIKE JEB BUSH. BUT NOW WHATEVER ALLIANCE CRUZ AND TRUMP HAD HAS BEEN REPLACED BY ALL-OUT WAR. IN FACT THE EXCHANGES BETWEEN THE TWO RIVALS DID WHAT MANY THOUGHT TO BE IMPOSSIBLE: CRUZ MADE TRUMP LOOK REASONABLE AND TRUMP MADE CRUZ LOOK LIKEABLE. IT STARTED OUT WITH A PROTRACTED BACK-AND-FORTH OVER CRUZ??S BIRTHPLACE. ??I RECOGNIZE THAT DONALD IS DISMAYED THAT HIS POLL NUMBERS ARE FALLING IN IOWA? CRUZ SAID IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION ABOUT THE NEW TRUMP ATTACK. ??BUT THE FACTS AND LAW HERE ARE REALLY QUITE CLEAR. UNDER LONGSTANDING U.S. LAW THE CHILD OF A U.S. CITIZEN BORN ABROAD IS A NATURAL BORN CITIZEN. IF A SOLDIER HAS A CHILD ABROAD THAT CHILD IS A NATURAL BORN CITIZEN.? TRUMP DOUBLED- AND TRIPLED-DOWN ON HIS CHARGE THAT DEMOCRATS WOULD USE THE FACT THAT CRUZ WAS BORN IN CANADA TO CHALLENGE HIS ELIGIBILITY. DON??T BLAME ME HE ARGUED I??M JUST THE BAD-NEWS BEARER THE TELLER OF TOUGH TRUTHS THE KEEPER OF REAL. ??YOU SAW THE NUMBERS YOURSELF NBC/WALL STREET JOURNAL CAME OUT WITH A POLL HEADLINE TRUMP WAY UP CRUZ GOING DOWN? TRUMP SAID TO BOOS FROM THE CROWD. ??THEY DON??T LIKE NBC BUT I LIKE THE POLL? HE SAID TRYING TO HUSH THE CROWD AND PROJECT THE VITRIOL ELSEWHERE. ??AND FRANKLY IT JUST CAME OUT AND IN IOWA NOW AS YOU KNOW TED IN THE LAST THREE POLLS I??M BEATING YOU. SO YOU SHOULDN??T MISREPRESENT HOW WELL YOU??RE DOING WITH THE POLLS.? TRUMP GLOWERED THROUGHOUT THEIR BIRTH CERTIFICATE BACK-AND-FORTH CITING HARVARD PROFESSOR LAURENCE TRIBE??S RECENT BOSTON GLOBE OP-ED QUESTIONING THE SENATOR??S ELIGIBILITY AND NOTING THAT OTHER LEGAL SCHOLARS HAD EXPRESSED SKEPTICISM ABOUT IT AS WELL. CRUZ SOUNDED EAGER TO LAUGH OFF THE CRITICISM. ??I??M NOT GONNA BE TAKING LEGAL ADVICE FROM DONALD TRUMP? HE SAID GRINNING. BUT TRUMP DIDN??T CRACK A SMILE. TRUMP??S DEMEANOR SEEMED DIFFERENT THAN IT??S BEEN PAST DEBATES WHERE HE??S MADE GOOFY FACES ROLLED HIS EYES THEATRICALLY AND MADE JOKES ABOUT HIS REPUBLICAN RIVALS??ESPECIALLY WHEN THAT RIVAL??S NAME IS JEB. BUT AT THE THURSDAY DEBATE THAT AFFABILITY WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. LATER THOUGH THE TENSION GOT EVEN WORSE. CRUZ HAS RECENTLY TAKEN TO JOKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT TRUMP IS FROM NEW YORK SUGGESTING THAT HIS ??NEW YORK VALUES? MEAN HE CAN??T BE A GOOD CONSERVATIVE. THE ISSUE AROSE AGAIN AND CRUZ LOOKED TO KEEP THINGS LIGHT. ??NOT A LOT OF CONSERVATIVES COME OUT OF MANHATTAN? THE SENATOR SAID. ??I??M JUST SAYING!? TRUMP DIDN??T LOOK AMUSED AND IMMEDIATELY SUGGESTED CRUZ??S CRITICISM MEANT HE WAS BEING GLIB ABOUT 9/11. ??I??VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT? TRUMP SAID DESCRIBING THE ATTACK??S AFTERMATH. ??AND THE PEOPLE IN NEW YORK FOUGHT AND FOUGHT AND FOUGHT AND WE SAW MORE DEATH AND EVEN THE SMELL OF DEATH NOBODY UNDERSTOOD IT AND IT WAS WITH US FOR MONTHS THE SMELL THE AIR? TRUMP CONTINUED. ??AND WE REBUILT DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN AND EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD WATCHED AND EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD LOVED NEW YORK AND LOVED NEW YORKERS AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT WAS A VERY INSULTING STATEMENT THAT TED MADE.? AS TRUMP MONOLOGUED CRUZ LOOKED ON IN SILENCE WINCING. AND HE DIDN??T ATTEMPT ANY RETORT. IT TAKES A LOT TO SILENCE A STAR COLLEGE DEBATER LIKE CRUZ BUT TRUMP GOT IT DONE. BACK IN SEPTEMBER THE PAIR TEAMED UP FOR A CAPITOL HILL RALLY ABOUT THEIR SHARED OPPOSITION TO THE IRAN DEAL. AND THIS SUMMER SOURCES TOLD THE DAILY BEAST THAT CRUZ WAS DELIBERATELY WOOING THE REAL ESTATE MOGUL. ??IN TERMS OF TRUMP??S CIVILITY IF YOU??RE NICE TO HIM HE??LL BE NICE TO YOU? ONE SOURCE SAID. ??AND CRUZ HAS BEEN NICE. CRUZ IS PLAYING THE LONG GAME AND HOPES THAT IF HE SURVIVES AND TRUMP DOESN??T THE BILLIONAIRE WILL SWING TO HIM.? TRUMP IN TURN TREATED CRUZ WITH CONDESCENDING KINDNESS. IN DECEMBER TRUMP EVEN ISSUED AN EXTREMELY RARE RETRACTION AFTER DESCRIBING CRUZ AS A ??MANIAC.? THE BACKLASH FROM CONSERVATIVE TALK RADIO WAS SWIFT??AND TRUMP QUICKLY RELENTED ON HIS ATTACKS. ??HE HAS A WONDERFUL TEMPERAMENT? TRUMP SAID AT THE DECEMBER REPUBLICAN DEBATE IN LAS VEGAS WHEN MODERATORS PRESSED HIM ON THAT CRITICISM. ??HE??S JUST FINE DON??T WORRY ABOUT IT.? AND TRUMP GAVE CRUZ AND AMICABLE PAT ON THE BACK. BUT THAT WAS BEFORE CRUZ ROSE PAST TRUMP IN IOWA AND BECAME A THREAT TO HIS DOMINANCE IN THE POLLS TRUMP BOASTS ABOUT AT EVERY CAMPAIGN RALLY. AND IF CRUZ LOST ONE FRIEND AT THIS DEBATE HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH ANOTHER FRENEMY SOMEHOW GOT WORSE AS CRUZ AND SEN. MARCO RUBIO CONTINUED THEIR FEUD OVER THEIR LEGISLATIVE RECORDS. ??I HATE TO INTERRUPT THIS EPISODE OF COURT TV? RUBIO QUIPPED AS HE INTERRUPTED THE CRUZ-TRUMP EXCHANGE OVER CRUZ??S CITIZENSHIP AND LAUNCHED INTO HIS PLATFORM. LATER THE TWO LAUNCHED INTO A FULL ITCHY AND SCRATCHY ROUTINE OVER WHETHER RUBIO WAS TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT CRUZ??S TAX PLAN AS WELL AS WHETHER CRUZ HAD FLIP-FLOPPED OVER CROP INSURANCE. ??I SAW YOU ON THE SENATE FLOOR FLIP YOUR VOTE ON CROP INSURANCE BECAUSE THEY TOLD YOU IT WOULD HELP YOU IN IOWA? RUBIO CHARGED. CRUZ SMILED AND THEN RETORTED ??I APPRECIATE YOU DUMPING YOUR OPPO [OPPOSITION] RESEARCH ON THE DEBATE STAGE??AT LEAST HALF THE THINGS MARCO SAID WERE FALSE.? AS THE CROWD BOO??D CRUZ TRUMP??EVER THE OPPORTUNIST SAW AN OPENING. ??YOU THINK THEY LIKE EACH OTHER?? HE SAID.

NEAR THE CORNER OF 13TH AND U STREETS IN NORTHWEST WASHINGTON D.C. TOURISTS AND RESIDENTS CAN FIND A TALL BRIGHTLY COLORED PORTRAIT OF TWO AFRICAN-AMERICAN ICONS PAINTED ON THE WALL OF A LOCAL RESTAURANT. ON THE LEFT THERE??S A GRINNING BARACK OBAMA PAINTED IN A WAY THAT CALLS TO MIND THE IMAGES OF HIS 2008 ??HOPE AND CHANGE? STREAK. AND ON THE RIGHT IS A LARGE SMIRKING BILL COSBY STARING DOWN AT ONLOOKERS. IT??S A FAMOUS MURAL ON THE WALL OF A FAMOUS WASHINGTON RESTAURANT NAMED BEN??S CHILI BOWL. IN 2009 PRESIDENT OBAMA STOPPED IN WITH THEN MAYOR ADRIAN FENTY. EVERYONE FROM U.S. REP. CHARLES RANGEL AND HILLARY CLINTON TO CHRIS ROCK AND BONO HAS PATRONIZED THIS LOCAL LANDMARK ONE OF THE VERY FEW BUSINESSES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD TO REMAIN OPEN AND UNHARMED DURING THE 1968 RIOTS. (RUSSELL CROWE??S CHARACTER IN THE 2009 THRILLER STATE OF PLAY IS A BIG FAN OF THEIR HALF-SMOKES AND CHEESEBURGERS). IT??S ALSO A LANDMARK WHERE COSBY HAS LONG BEEN ADORED. THE COMIC HAS BEEN A LONGTIME FRIEND AND SUPPORTER OF THE ALI FAMILY WHICH FOUNDED AND OWNS BEN??S. HE HAS VISITED THE ESTABLISHMENT EVER SINCE 1958 WHEN HE WAS DOING A STINT IN THE NAVY AND HE (LIKE THE OBAMA FAMILY) IS ALWAYS INVITED TO DINE THERE FREE OF CHARGE. OVER THE LAST YEAR CALLS HAVE INTENSIFIED FOR THE COSBY MURAL TO BE REMOVED. (COSBY HAS ALREADY BEEN STRIPPED OF HIS HONORARY NAVY TITLE A DISNEY STATUE AND ANOTHER MURAL IN NORTH PHILADELPHIA.)

PART OF A?ŸLUCRATIVE NETFLIX DEAL THAT ALSO INCLUDES STAND-UP SPECIALS AND AN?ŸUPCOMING TALK SHOW SET TO LAUNCH LATER THIS YEAR HANDLER EXECUTIVE PRODUCES CHELSEA DOES WHICH AS SHE SAYS FINDS HER MORE VULNERABLE AND EXPOSED THAN WE??VE EVER SEEN HER??A TALL ORDER FOLLOWING HER RECENT?ŸTOPLESS INSTAGRAM CRUSADE. ??WHEN YOU??RE YOURSELF ON TV ALL THE TIME YOU THINK PEOPLE ARE GETTING TO KNOW YOUR FULL PERSONALITY? SHE SAYS. ??WHEREAS THAT PERSONALITY THAT WAS BEING REPRESENTED ON MY OLD SHOW WAS VERY ONE-DIMENSIONAL: I??M IN CHARGE I??M A BITCH I??M GOING TO TELL YOU WHEN TO SHUT UP AND BLAH BLAH BLAH.??? ENTER CHELSEA DOES. ??THIS IS REAL AND THIS IS THE FULL SPECTRUM OF ME? SHE SAYS. ??IT??S ME BEING SILLY AND STUPID AND FUNNY AND BRIGHT AND SMART AND EVERYTHING THAT IS EMBODIED IN MY PERSONALITY.? CHELSEA DOES MARRIAGE FOR EXAMPLE FINDS HER VISITING A LAS VEGAS DRIVE-IN CHAPEL AND ATTENDING A BACHELORETTE PARTY. CHELSEA DOES SILICON VALLEY HAS HER PITCHING AN APP. CHELSEA DOES RACE HAS HANDLER TRAVELING TO THE DEEP SOUTH TO UNCOVER LINGERING RACIAL TENSION PATROLLING THE U.S.-MEXICO BORDER TRAVELING TO ISRAEL AND TACKLING THE CULTURE OF POLITICAL CORRECTNESS??AN ISSUE SHE WROTE AN OP-ED ABOUT FOR THE DAILY BEAST??BY FACING A FIRING SQUAD OF PROPRIETY POLICE FEATURING REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE THE NAACP AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS TO GLEAN WHAT THEY FIND OFFENSIVE AND WHY. WHILE HAPPILY DEFERRING TO DIRECTOR EDDIE SCHMIDT (THIS FILM IS NOT YET RATED) AND PRODUCER MORGAN NEVILLE (20 YEARS FROM STARDOM) FOR MUCH OF THE FILMING HANDLER SAYS SHE REALLY TOOK THE LEAD ON CHELSEA DOES DRUGS WHICH HAS HER SHARING A CATERED MEAL OF MARIJUANA-INFUSED FOOD WITH FRIENDS AND SPENDING A NIGHT ON CAMERA AFTER MIXING AMBIEN AND ALCOHOL. BUT EVEN THEN SHE DIDN??T ENTIRELY GET TO DO OR SHOW EVERYTHING SHE WANTED TO DO. BECAUSE IT WAS ILLEGAL. ??I WAS LIKE ??LET??S DO MUSHROOMS! LET??S DO COCAINE TO SHOW EVERYONE WHAT IT??S LIKE BEING ON COKE!??? SHE SAYS. ??THEY WERE LIKE ??THAT??S ILLEGAL!?? BUT THEY LET US GO TO PERU AND DO AYAHUASCA. WHAT NETWORK IS GOING TO SAY YES TO THAT? ONLY NETFLIX.? DOES HANDLER HAVE AN AGENDA OR AT LEAST A PERSPECTIVE GUIDING HER FACT-FINDING MISSION? OF COURSE AND THAT??S SORT OF THE POINT OF CHELSEA DOES. ??I??VE NEVER EVER HAD THE FEELING EVER TO BE LIKE OH MY GOD I WANT TO BE IN A WEDDING DRESS. AND I WANT TO WALK DOWN AN AISLE??? SHE SAYS IN THE EARLY MINUTES OF CHELSEA DOES MARRIAGE FOR EXAMPLE. ??LIKE THAT TO ME IS NAUSEA-INDUCING. BUT I??M QUESTIONING THINGS ABOUT IT THAT I NEVER DID BEFORE.? HANDLER HAS BEEN IN SERIOUS RELATIONSHIPS. A LONG-TERM BOYFRIEND SHE HAD WHILE SHE WAS IN HER TWENTIES IS INTERVIEWED IN CHELSEA DOES MARRIAGE. SHE DATED TED HARBERT WHO OVERSAW E! AS THE FORMER CEO OF COMCAST FOR NEARLY FOUR YEARS AND AFTERWARD WAS ATTACHED ON-AND-OFF TO HOTEL MANAGER ANDR?? BALAZS FOR TWO YEARS. SHE ALSO BRIEFLY DATED RAPPER 50 CENT A CURIO THAT WILL LIKELY FOLLOW HER TO THE GRAVE. ??I KNOW AND WE ONLY DATED FOR TWO MONTHS? SHE SAYS ROLLING HER EYES. ??IT??S LIKE MENTIONED IN EVERY ARTICLE. IT??S SO FUNNY. IT??S PROBABLY MORE ANNOYING TO HIM??ACTUALLY HE PROBABLY LOVES IT.? THERE??S AN OBVIOUS FASCINATION ABOUT HANDLER??S PERSONAL LIFE GIVEN HER OWN ADMITTED PUBLIC CANDOR ABOUT IT??ONE OF HER BOOKS WAS CALLED MY HORIZONTAL LIFE AFTER ALL??BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF HER VIEWS ON MARRIAGE. WHAT CHELSEA DOES MARRIAGE DOES HOWEVER IS MAKE A DISTINCTION: JUST BECAUSE SHE DOESN??T WANT TO WALK DOWN THE AISLE DOESN??T MEAN THAT SHE DOESN??T VALUE A PARTNER AND COMMITMENT. ??BEFORE I THINK MY PROBLEM WITH MARRIAGE WAS THAT I DIDN??T WANT TO DO ANYTHING THAT WAS EXPECTED OF ME? SHE SAYS. MAKING THROUGH THE YEARS OF WHEN-ARE-YOU-GOING-TO-GET-MARRIED-AND-HAVE-KIDS? NEEDLING FELT LIKE A VICTORY LAP. ??WHEN I TURNED 40 I WAS LIKE ??LOOK! NOT MARRIED! NOT DIVORCED! NO KIDS!?? JUST LIKE I SAID I WANTED TO BE.? NOW THAT SHE??S MADE IT TO THAT 40-YEAR-OLD MILESTONE HER FEELINGS ABOUT HAVE GOTTEN A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED??AND SOMEHOW CLEARER TOO. ??I WAS LIKE OK NOW THE PRESSURE??S OFF? SHE SAYS. ??NOW I WOULD DO SOMETHING BECAUSE IT??S UNEXPECTED. I WOULD DO IT IF I MET SOMEBODY. I THINK I WAS PAIRING THE SHOWCASE OF IT THE WHOLE PAGEANTRY OF WEDDINGS WITH COMMITMENT RATHER THAN REALIZING THEY COULD BECOME TWO SEPARATE THINGS.? NOT THAT SHE??S AGGRESSIVELY IN THE MARKET FOR SOMEONE NOW. ??MY MIND??S NOT EVEN THERE LATELY? SHE SAYS. ??WHEN YOU DO SOMETHING LIKE THESE PROJECTS THAT ARE SO FULFILLING I??M LIKE ??OK WHAT CAN WE DO NEXT??? MY FRIENDS ARE LIKE ??DO YOU WANT TO MEET THIS GUY??? AND I??M LIKE ??NOT REALLY.?? IF I??M GOING TO MEET THEM I??LL MEET THEM WHEN I??M SUPPOSED TO.? SHE LETS OUT A BIG LAUGH: ??LIKE ALL OF A SUDDEN I BELIEVE IN FATE.? IF NOT FATE PARTNERING WITH NETFLIX WAS CERTAINLY KISMET FOR HANDLER. TO SEE HER TREATING THE STREAMING SERVICE AS A HAVEN OF SORTS SHOULDN??T SHOCK ANYONE WHO SENSED HER VERY PALPABLE EXASPERATION WITH MAKING FUN OF CELEBRITIES ON E! FOR SEVEN YEARS. SHE DIDN??T EXACT CONCEAL IT. IN FACT SHE AGGRESSIVELY VOCALIZED IT. HANDLER LANDED HER LATE-NIGHT GIG IN 2006 AFTER YEARS OF WORKING THE LOS ANGELES STAND-UP CIRCUIT AND MAKING A QUIET MARK IN THE OXYGEN NETWORK HIDDEN CAMERA SHOW GIRLS BEHAVING BADLY. SHE HAD RESERVATIONS WHEN E! WANTED TO REFORMAT A WEEKLY SKETCH SHOW SHE WAS HIRED TO STAR IN INTO A DAILY WRAP-UP OF TMZ TABLOID STORIES A GENRE SHE LOATHED BUT LEANED INTO THE SERIES WITH HER OWN ACERBIC SENSE OF HUMOR. IT QUICKLY BECAME ONE OF E!??S HIGHEST RATED PROGRAMS TURNED HANDLER INTO ONE OF THE MOST RECOGNIZABLE FIGURES IN HOLLYWOOD AND OVER THE COURSE OF SEVEN YEARS AND MORE THAN 1000 EPISODES EVENTUALLY MADE HER MISERABLE. ??I DIDN??T WANT TO BE THERE? SHE BEGINS SAYING THAT IT WAS AROUND THE FIFTH YEAR OF CHELSEA LATELY THAT SHE RAN OUT OF ENTHUSIASM. ??EVERYONE WAS ANNOYING ME. MY STAFF WAS FIGHTING ABOUT WHO WAS GOING TO BE ON AIR ALL THE TIME. THEY WERE CATTY. I WAS LIKE ??THIS IS SO CHILDISH.??? STILL A SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE STAFF SHE EMPLOYED EVEN IF THEY GOT ON HER NERVES GUILTED HER IN A WAY INTO KEEPING THE SHOW RUNNING??UNTIL SHE REALIZED HOW RIDICULOUS IT WAS TO MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON THAT. ??SO I THINK THE LAST GO ROUND I DIDN??T EVEN REALLY DECIDE? SHE SAYS. ??I JUST SAID IT ON HOWARD STERN LIKE ??YEAH I GUESS I??M NOT GOING TO DO THAT AGAIN?? AND I FIGURED THAT SINCE I HAD THOUGHT IT I HAD ALREADY SAID IT.? (FORMER STAFF MEMBERS HAVE SAID?ŸTHEY WERE BLINDSIDED BY THE ANNOUNCEMENT.) ??I WAS JUST LIKE ??THAT??S A WRAP ON THIS.??? CHELSEA DOES SERVES A BRIDGE BETWEEN WHAT SHE USED TO DO ON CHELSEA LATELY AND HER NEW SHOW THAT WILL DEBUT ON NETFLIX LATER THIS YEAR. ??IT??S NOT GOING TO BE A TALK SHOW THAT YOU USUALLY SEE? SHE SAYS APOLOGIZING THAT NETFLIX HAS FORBIDDEN HER FROM REVEALING MORE SPECIFIC DETAILS. ??IT??S NOT GOING TO BE A LATE-NIGHT SHOW. I??M DONE WITH THAT. I??M NOT DOING THAT AGAIN.? AND AT THE VERY LEAST CHELSEA DOES PROVES THAT ANYONE WHO JUDGED HANDLER BASED ON THE CELEBRITY-FOCUS OF CHELSEA LATELY HAS BEEN UNDERESTIMATING WHAT SHE??S CAPABLE OF. ??I HOPE SO? SHE SAYS. ??I THINK I UNDERESTIMATE MYSELF.? AS SHE TELLS IT EACH PHASE HER CAREER SEEMS ACCIDENTAL. BUT EACH MEMORY IS ACCOMPANIED WITH A QUIP ABOUT WHAT HARD WORK IT WAS.?Ÿ \WHEN I START SOMETHING NEW I'M LIKE 'I WONDER IF I CAN WRITE A BOOK.' ALRIGHT LET'S DO THAT\"" SHE SAYS.. \""'I WONDER IF I CAN WRITE ANOTHER ONE.' LET'S DO IT. AND I ALSO KIND OF FEEL LIKE THE BOOK STUFF I'M DONE WITH RIGHT NOW. I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT. STAND-UP I'M DONE WITH. BEEN THERE DONE THAT. I'VE DONE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN DO AS A STAND-UP. AND I DID IT SO MUCH FOUR HUGE TOURS THAT I GOT GOOD AT IT AND I'M DONE. I WANT TO GET GOOD AT OTHER STUFF.\"" IN THE YEAR AND A HALF SINCE SHE'S BEEN ON TV SHE BRIEFLY WONDERED IF AFTER AT ONE POINT VERGING ON OVEREXPOSURE SHE HAD BECOME IRREVELANT. IT WAS A FLEETING THOUGHT WHEN AS HARD AS SHE WAS WORKING ON CHELSEA DOES SHE RELISHED A BREAK FROM IT ALL.?Ÿ SHE WAS EXHAUSTED FROM FLYING TO THE NEXT COMEDY TOUR STOP ON THURSDAY NIGHTS AFTER TAPING CHELSEA LATELY. SHE TOOK A BREATH. SHE BOUGHT A HOUSE IN SPAIN AND LEARNED SPANISH. SHE SPENT TIME WITH HER FAMILY WITHOUT FEELING THE PRESSURE OF WORK IN THE BACK OF HER MIND.?Ÿ\""THAT WAS IMPORTANT.\"" SHE REMEMBERS WHEN SHE GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL THE YOUNGEST OF SIX KIDS TO A JEWISH FATHER AND MORMON MOTHER IN NEW JERSEY. ALL OF HER SIBLINGS HAD GONE TO COLLEGE. HER FATHER TOLD HER IT WOULD BE A WASTE OF TIME TO DO THE SAME??IN THE LOVING WE-KNOW-WHAT-YOUR-FUTURE-HOLDS WAY??SUGGESTING THAT SHE HEAD TO CALIFORNIA INSTEAD. SHE WAITED TABLES WHILE AUDITIONING FOR RANDOM ACTING JOBS AND DOING STAND-UP ON THE WEEKENDS. SHE WAS BROKE??FOR A VERY LONG TIME??RELYING ON HER PARENTS AND SIBLINGS TO SEND HER MONEY. STILL THEY NEVER DOUBTED THAT SHE WAS GOING TO MAKE IT IN AN INDUSTRY WHERE ALMOST NO ONE DOES. ??I THOUGHT MY FAMILY WAS GOING TO BE LIKE ??FUCK WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO GET A GRIP AND GET A REAL JOB???? SHE SAYS. ??BUT THEY NEVER ONCE DID. I??M 26 BORROWING MONEY AND WAITING TABLES PARTYING NOT HAVING MY ACT TOGETHER. BUT THEY NEVER ONCE SAID ??GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER.?? AND THANK GOD THEY BELIEVED IN ME BECAUSE I DON??T KNOW IF I WOULD HAVE.? UNDERSTANDING HER CONNECTION TO HER FAMILY IS KEY TO UNDERSTANDING CHELSEA HANDLER. WHEN SHE WAS 10 HANDLER??S BROTHER DIED WHILE HE WAS HIKING THE GRAND TETONS A FORMATIVE EXPERIENCE FOR THE BABY OF FAMILY AND SOMETHING THAT OVER THE YEARS FIERCELY BONDED THE HANDLERS TOGETHER. THEN IN 2006 HANDLER LOST HER MOTHER RITA TO A BATTLE WITH BREAST CANCER. ??I GREW UP AT THAT MOMENT? HANDLER SAYS. SHE RETURNED FROM HER BOOK TOUR IN LONDON TO BE BY HER AILING MOTHER??S BEDSIDE ARRIVING AGHAST THAT NO ONE IN HER FAMILY WAS CAPABLE OF HANDLING THE SITUATION. ??I WAS THE ONLY PERSON THAT COULD BE LIKE ??LET HER DIE! SHE DOESN??T WANT TO BE REMEMBERED LIKE THIS.??? THERE WAS A WOMAN SMOKING IN BED NEXT TO RITA??S AND HER BROTHER AND FATHER WERE JUST SITTING THERE. ??MY MOTHER JUST LOOKED AT ME BECAUSE I WAS SUCH A FUCKING SHIT-KICKER? HANDLER SAYS. SHE CURSED OUT THE NURSES GOT HER MOTHER A PRIVATE ROOM SCREAMED ON HER BEHALF WHEN SHE NEEDED MORE MORPHINE AND SLEPT ON A COT NEXT TO THE HOSPITAL BED FOR THE NEXT 10 DAYS. ??MY BROTHER WAS LIKE ??OH MY GOD. I??VE NEVER SEEN YOU TAKE CHARGE??? SHE SAYS HER VOICE CRACKING AS HER EYES WELL WITH TEARS. ??I WAS LIKE IT??S BECAUSE YOU GUYS AREN??T BEING RESPONSIBLE. SHE??S DYING. LET HER FUCKING DIE.? SHE GRABS A NAPKIN AND STARTS DABBING HER EYES. ??I CAN??T BELIEVE I??M CRYING ABOUT THIS IT??S NOT EVEN NOON? SHE LAUGHED BEFORE CONTINUING HER STORY. ??AT MY MOM??S FUNERAL MY BROTHER GAVE THIS BEAUTIFUL EULOGY. IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL. HE??S SUCH A GREAT PUBLIC SPEAKER. AND YOU KNOW WE??RE ALL IN OUR OWN WORLDS. AND HE SAID ABOUT ME AND MY SISTER ??I??VE NEVER SEEN MY TWO KID SISTERS GROW UP RIGHT BEFORE MY EYES. THEY??RE BOTH WOMEN NOW.?? AND HE??S RIGHT. I STEPPED UP AND WAS NOT THE KID AND BECAME AN ADULT. AND IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL TIME.

THAT??S NOT ALL OF WHAT I??M SEEING. DOES SHE WISH OTHER PEOPLE THE OTHER THINGS TOO? ??WHEN YOU??RE A WOMAN AND YOU??RE FORTHRIGHT PEOPLE ARE LIKE ??OH SHE??S A BITCH.??

KEVIN T. CUSTIS CLAIMS TO BE AFFILIATED. ??YOU??RE THE FOURTH PERSON TO ASK TODAY.? IT??S A SIMILAR RESPONSE AT THE SECOND ADDRESS I TRY??ALSO THE WRONG ONE. ??YOU??RE LOOKING FOR THAT ONE DOCTOR? A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN AT THE DOOR SAYS. ??I THINK HE??S FOUR BLOCKS THAT WAY.? CUSTIS A FAMILY PHYSICIAN FROM BALTIMORE MARYLAND GRADUATED FROM SUNY DOWNSTATE MEDICAL CENTER COLLEGE OF MEDICINE IN 1996. DESCRIBED AS AN ??EXEMPLARY RESIDENT? BY HIS PROFESSORS HE DIDN??T MAKE NEWS AGAIN UNTIL LAST YEAR WHEN HIS NAME APPEARED IN A NEW YORK TIMES INVESTIGATION OF THREE-QUARTER HOUSES. THREE-QUARTER HOUSES ARE UNLICENSED FACILITIES THAT FALSELY MARKET THEMSELVES AS REHABILITATION CENTERS. IN REALITY LANDLORDS EXPLOIT THEIR TENANTS??OFTEN DRUG ADDICTS OR MENTALLY ILL??USING THEM FOR MEDICAID KICKBACKS. NEW YORK HAS CREATED A TASK FORCE TO COMBAT THEM. ONE SUCH LANDLORD YURY BAUMLIT THE CENTRAL CHARACTER OF THE TIMES REPORT ALLEGEDLY REQUIRED HIS TENANTS GO TO SEE CUSTIS. ACCORDING TO THE REPORT 17 INDIVIDUALS SAY THEY WERE TAKEN TO CUSTIS?? CLINIC AND ??FORCED TO UNDERGO THREE TO FOUR HOURS OF TESTING IN ORDER TO GET A BED.? LURED THERE BY FREE PIZZA EACH WAS ALLEGEDLY PAID $20 TO STAY. AN INDIVIDUAL NAMED JOSE PEREZ REPORTED UNDERGOING 19 DIFFERENT TESTS INCLUDING ??ULTRASOUNDS OF CEREBRAL ARTERIES? TO THE TUNE OF $1700 IN MEDICAID. OTHERS SAY THEY MET A MAN WHO TOLD THEM HE WAS A ??RECRUITER? WHO ??DROVE A VAN AROUND TO FIND PATIENTS FROM SHELTERS CHURCHES AND WELFARE OFFICES ??WHERE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE MEDICAID AND DON??T HAVE MONEY.??? PEREZ GUESSED THAT WAS THE REASON FOR THE TESTS. ??THEY GET RICH OFF ALL OF US? HE SAID. IN RESPONSE TO THE ALLEGATIONS CUSTIS TOLD THE TIMES THAT THE TESTS WERE PART OF A CLINICAL STUDY HE WAS PERFORMING WITH A RESEARCHER FROM MT. SINAI. WHEN CONTACTED THE HOSPITAL DENIED ANY INVOLVEMENT. THE MOST RECENT STUDY PUBLISHED BY CUSTIS ON PUBMED DATES BACK TO 1992. WHILE THE TIMES REPORT HAS PROMPTED A MAJOR INVESTIGATION OF BAUMLIT??WHO IT WAS ANNOUNCED IN AUGUST IS FACING CRIMINAL CHARGES??CUSTIS IT SEEMS QUIETLY KEPT GOING. WHETHER HE??S LEAVING HIS ALLEGED MEDICAID CONSPIRACY BEHIND TO START PRESCRIBING MEDICAL MARIJUANA LEGALLY OR HAS ANOTHER TRICK UP HIS SLEEVE ENTIRELY REMAINS TO BE SEEN. *** IT IS NEXT DOOR TO A FAMILY DOLLAR ON AN OTHERWISE EMPTY STREET THAT I FINALLY FIND CUSTIS??OR AT LEAST HIS OFFICE. A NAVY BLUE AWNING WITH HIS NAME IN WHITE PAINT HANGS ABOVE THE FRONT DOOR ITS WINDOWS CONCEALED BY METALLIC PAPER. TWO LARGE WINDOWS BESIDE IT ARE LINED WITH WHITE GRATES BOTH BROWNING WITH RUST. INSIDE THE 24 PLASTIC CHAIRS THAT MAKE UP THE WAITING ROOM ARE EMPTY. IT??S QUIET AND SMELLS LIKE CLEANING SOLUTION AND THE NURSES??ALL SIX OF THEM??ARE KIND. ??HE WENT TO THE HOSPITAL FOR AN EMERGENCY WITH ONE OF HIS PATIENTS? ONE NAMED CATHY TELLS ME. ??HE??S HERE EVERY DAY BUT HE LEAVES TO GO DO THAT.? CATHY ISN??T SURE WHICH HOSPITAL CUSTIS GOES TO OR MAYBE SHE CAN??T SAY. NO ONE SEEMS TO KNOW WHEN HE??LL BE BACK??PERHAPS TOMORROW THEY SAY. HE DOESN??T HAVE A CELL PHONE NUMBER OR AN EMAIL BUT SHE PROMISES HE??LL CALL. TWO DAYS AND SIX MESSAGES LATER HE STILL HASN??T. ON HIS WEBMD PAGE CUSTIS??S PRACTICE IS DESCRIBED AS A ??COMPASSIONATE? PLACE THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDING ??EXCELLENT AND COMPREHENSIVE PRIMARY CARE? TO PATIENTS IN BROOKLYN FOR MORE THAN 18 YEARS. CUSTIS?? PAGE LISTS $150 AS THE PRICE FOR ONE 30-MINUTE SESSION AND SAYS MOST PATIENTS WILL NEED TO COMPLETE FOUR SESSIONS IN ORDER TO FORM A ??BONAFIDE RELATIONSHIP? WITH THE DOCTOR??I.E. IN ORDER TO GET A SUBSCRIPTION. THE FIRST FEW REVIEWS DATED LAST YEAR OR OLDER GIVE FIVE STARS AND DESCRIBE HIM AS ??FRIENDLY? ??CARING? AND ??UNDERSTANDING.? THE MORE RECENT REVIEWS SINCE NEW YORK CITY??S DISPENSARIES OPENED PAINT A DIFFERENT PICTURE. ON JANUARY 12 A WOMAN NAMED MALAGOS WROTE: ??DROVE 2 HRS FOR AN APPOINTMENT ONLY TO BE TOLD THAT THE DOCTOR HAD AN EMERGENCY NO ONE EVER CALLED. WAS EVALUATED BY THE TECH OR PA WHO STATED THAT THE FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENTS COULD BE SKYPED/ REPEATED APPOINTMENTS FAXES AND PHONE CALLS (THOUGH NO ONE SEEMS TO EVER BE THERE TO ANSWER THE PHONE) WERE IGNORED. I FEEL LIKE MY PAYMENT WAS STOLEN FRAUDULENTLY [SIC].? A WEEK EARLIER KAREN S. HAD A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE: ??I DROVE OVER 2 HOURS AND 50 MINUTES FOR MY APPOINTMENT WHICH WAS SCHEDULED TWICE. THEY CALLED TO SCHEDULE MY FIRST APPOINTMENT. WHEN WE ARRIVED I THOUGHT I WALKED INTO THE WRONG PLACE. IT LOOKED LIKE A HOMELESS SHELTER IN THERE. ON THE WEBSITE THE FEE WAS $95 WHICH CHANGED TO $55 MORE. ON TOP OF THAT I EXPECTED SINCE PATIENTS MUST PAY CASH IN SUCH A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT I WOULD BE IN A BETTER ENVIRONMENT SURROUNDED BY OBVIOUS DRUG ABUSERS. NOT PATIENTS THAT REALLY NEED HELP FOR MEDICAL USE [SIC]. ?? *** IN MANY WAYS CUSTIS IS A SMALL PART OF A MUCH BIGGER PROBLEM: NEW YORK??S MEDICAL MARIJUANA PROGRAM IS BROKEN. ACCORDING TO THE COMPASSIONATE CARE ACT IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO PRESCRIBE MARIJUANA NEW YORK DOCTORS IN GOOD STANDING MUST COMPLETE A FOUR-HOUR ONLINE COURSE TO BE CERTIFIED. AT A COST OF $249 THE COURSE INCLUDES THINGS LIKE POTENTIAL DRUG INTERACTIONS DOSING AND ROUTES OF ADMINISTRATION. AS OF THIS WEEK ONLY 203 DOCTORS HAVE REGISTERED TO PRESCRIBE MEDICAL MARIJUANA IN NEW YORK STATE??A NUMBER THAT CONSIDERING ITS 79000 ACTIVE PHYSICIANS AMOUNTS TO LESS THAN 1 PERCENT. HARDLY ANY OF THESE DOCTORS HAVE CHOSEN TO MAKE THEMSELVES PUBLIC ON MARIJUANADOCTORS.COM THE ZOCDOC OF CANNABIS. IN BROOKLYN CUSTIS IS THE ONLY ONE. ACTIVISTS AND POLICY MAKERS BLAME THIS LACK OF PARTICIPATION THE LOWEST IN ANY STATE ON THE ??UNPRECEDENTED? AND ONEROUS REGISTRATION PROCESS FOR PHYSICIANS. THE ONLY OTHER STATE WITH A SIMILAR TEST NEW JERSEY HAS THE SECOND LOWEST PARTICIPATION NATIONWIDE. NEW YORK??S LACK OF PRESCRIBING DOCTORS IS MADE WORSE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH??S REFUSAL TO ISSUE A PUBLIC LIST OF THE PHYSICIANS WHO HAVE COMPLETED THE TEST. WITHOUT IT MILLIONS OF NEW YORK RESIDENTS WHO NEED MEDICAL MARIJUANA ARE MISSING A VITAL ROADMAP. THE ABSENCE OF SUCH A LIST WHICH THE DOH CLAIMS THEY WILL EVENTUALLY MAKE AVAILABLE (BUT ONLY TO PHYSICIANS) HAS LED TO AN INFLUX OF CALLS TO MARIJUANADOCTORS.COM. SO MANY APPARENTLY THAT THE SITE HAS CREATED A RED BANNER THAT FLASHES ACROSS ITS HOMEPAGE. ??ATTENTION NY RESIDENTS!? IT READS. ??DUE TO OVER 300 PHONE CALLS A DAY WE ARE EXPERIENCING RATHER HIGH HOLD TIMES PLEASE BE PATIENT WITH US.? WITHOUT THEIR OWN PHYSICIANS PRESCRIBING MEDICAL MARIJUANA PATIENTS HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO SEEK OUT THE DOCTORS THEY CAN FIND??ONES LIKE CUSTIS. DUE TO THE HIGH VOLUME OF NEED DOCTORS LIKE THIS CAN (AND DO) CHARGE HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS PER SESSION AND MANDATE AS MANY AS VISITS AS THEY WANT BEFORE THE PATIENT IS APPROVED. IT??S A LUCRATIVE CONCEPT FOR THE DOCTORS AND A DANGEROUS ONE FOR THE PATIENTS NARROWING THE POOL OF DOCTORS TO A LEVEL WHERE GETTING TREATMENT MEANS OVERLOOKING POTENTIAL CRIMINAL ACTIVITY LIKE IN THE CASE OF CUSTIS. JULIE NETHERLAND DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF ACADEMIC ENGAGEMENT FOR THE DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE HAS TALKED TO COUNTLESS PATIENTS ABOUT THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY ABOUT WHICH DOCTORS ARE CERTIFIED. ??IT??S CONCERNING? SHE SAYS OF THE STATE??S HANDLING. ??OUR HOPE IS THAT MORE PHYSICIANS WILL COME ON BOARD BUT RIGHT NOW WHAT WE??RE HEARING FROM PATIENTS IS ENORMOUS FRUSTRATION AND ANGER THAT THEY CAN??T ACCESS THE PROGRAM.? IN NETHERLAND??S EYES NEW YORK??S TIGHT RESTRICTIONS HAVE SERVED TO MAKE THE PROGRAM LESS SAFE??THE OPPOSITE OF THEIR INTENTION. ??THE DOH SAYS IT??S TRYING TO PREVENT DOCTOR SHOPPING TO PREVENT ??POT DOCS?? WHO ARE PROCESSING HUNDREDS OF PATIENTS? SHE SAYS. ??BUT BECAUSE THERE IS NO PUBLIC LIST WHAT??S GOING TO HAPPEN IS DOCTORS WHO ADVERTISE AND GET THE WORD OUT ARE THE ONES THAT PATIENTS ARE GOING TO GRAVITATE TOWARDS.

TED CRUZ. ??SENATOR CRUZ I WAS DISAPPOINTED BY YOUR DISPARAGING REMARKS ABOUT NEW YORK VALUES SOMEHOW BEING DIFFERENT FROM IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE VALUES? READ A FACEBOOK POST BY RETIRED NYPD POLICE OFFICER JIM SMITH HUSBAND OF FALLEN POLICE OFFICER MOIRA SMITH. ??I INVITE YOU TO COME TO THE NATIONAL 9-11 MEMORIAL AND MUSEUM AND SEE FOR YOURSELF AND PERHAPS LEARN SOMETHING ABOUT THE VALUES OF NEW YORKERS AND THE HEROES WHO DEFENDED AMERICAN VALUES ON SEPTEMBER 11TH 2001.? THE REMARKS IN QUESTION ACCOMPANIED CRUZ??S SUGGESTION THAT DONALD TRUMP PLAY ??NEW YORK NEW YORK? RATHER THAN ??BORN IN THE USA? AT CAMPAIGN RALLIES. ??BECAUSE DONALD COMES FROM NEW YORK AND HE EMBODIES NEW YORK VALUES? CRUZ THEN SAID. SHOULD CRUZ NOW ACCEPT THE INVITATION HE WILL SEE THE NAME MOIRA SMITH AMONG THOSE OF HUNDREDS OF OTHERS WHO TRULY DID EMBODY NEW YORK VALUES AND THEREFORE AMERICAN VALUES. A FAMOUS PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN ON 9/11 SHOWS MOIRA SMITH LEADING A BLEEDING EXECUTIVE TO SAFETY FROM THE SOUTH TOWER. THE 38-YEAR-OLD COP THEN RETURNED TO DIREST DANGER AND IS CREDITED WITH SAVING HUNDREDS OF LIVES. ANOTHER SURVIVING EXECUTIVE WOULD REMEMBER THE EVENNESS OF HER VOICE AND THE STEADINESS OF HER EYES AS SHE KEPT PEOPLE MOVING WHEN THEY OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE FROZEN AT THE SIGHT OF THE HORRENDOUS CARNAGE IN THE PLAZA. ??DON??T LOOK KEEP MOVING? SHE SAID AGAIN AND AGAIN. SHE WAS STILL THERE URGING OTHERS TO SAFETY WHEN THE TOWER CAME DOWN. HER 2-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER PATRICIA LATER ACCEPTED THE NYPD MEDAL OF HONOR ON HER BEHALF AND STOOD WITH THE EMERALD GREEN RIBBON AROUND HER NECK THE EIGHT-POINTED GOLD STAR HANGING JUST ABOVE HER KNEES. MOIRA SMITH??S BATTERED SHIELD NUMBER 10467 WAS RECOVERED FROM THE RUINS. JIM SMITH WOULD BE SURE TO SHOW IT TO CRUZ ON DISPLAY ALONG WITH HER GUN BELT AT THE SEPTEMBER 11 MUSEUM. WHEN CRUZ EMERGES FROM THE MUSEUM TO STAND WHERE JIM SMITH??S WIFE DIED THE TEXAS SENATOR WILL BE ABLE TO LOOK ACROSS WEST STREET FROM THE MEMORIAL TO THE HEADQUARTERS OF GOLDMAN SACHS HIS OWN WIFE??S EMPLOYER. AS HAS BEEN REPORTED IN THE NEW YORK TIMES HEIDI CRUZ BORROWED AS MUCH AS $500000 FROM THE WALL STREET MEGA-FIRM WHERE SHE IS A MANAGING DIRECTOR TO HELP BANKROLL HER HUSBAND??S 2012 RUN FOR SENATE. A CRUZ SPOKESWOMAN SAYS HIS FAILURE TO DISCLOSE THE GOLDMAN SACHS LOAN WAS ??INADVERTENT.? THE SPOKESWOMAN COULD NOT EXPLAIN HOW THE HALF-MILLION FROM THE VAMPIRE SQUID JIBES WITH THE TOUCHING TALE TED CRUZ HAS TOLD OF TELLING HIS ??SWEETHEART? THAT HE WANTED TO ??LIQUIDATE OUR ENTIRE NET WORTH LIQUID NET WORTH AND PUT IT IN THE CAMPAIGN.? NOW RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT CRUZ HAS AN EVEN BIGGER NEED FOR MONEY. AND WHEN HE CAME TO NEW YORK IN DECEMBER IT WAS NOT TO VISIT THE 9/11 MEMORIAL. THE MAN WHO TALKS ABOUT CARPET-BOMBING ISIS IN FACT SKIPPED A SENATE HEARING ON ISIS TO ATTEND A MADISON AVENUE FUNDRAISER. A $2700-PER-PERSON ??VIP RECEPTION? WAS FOLLOWED BY A $1000-A-PLATE LUNCHEON. THE EVENT WAS HOSTED BY JOSEPH KONZELMANN A MANAGING DIRECTOR AT WHAT ELSE BUT GOLDMAN SACHS. WHATEVER VALUES ALL THAT EMBODIES THEY CERTAINLY ARE NOT AMERICAN VALUES OR FOR THAT MATTER NATURAL BORN CANADIAN VALUES. IF CRUZ DOES COME BACK TO NEW YORK FOR A TOUR OF THE SACRED GROUND ACROSS FROM PRODIGIOUSLY PROFANE GOLDMAN SACHS HE WILL FIND THAT JIM SMITH IS NOBODY??S LIBERAL AND NOT THE LEAST BIT AFRAID TO BE POLITICALLY INCORRECT. SMITH PROVED THAT LAST NOVEMBER AFTER GLAMOUR MAGAZINE NAMED CAITLYN JENNER ITS 2015 WOMAN OF THE YEAR. FOURTEEN YEARS BEFORE GLAMOUR HAD POSTHUMOUSLY NAMED MOIRA SMITH ITS 2001 WOMAN OF THE YEAR. JIM SMITH NOW RETURNED THE AWARD TO THE MAGAZINE IN PROTEST.

THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORTED SATURDAY THAT BLOOMBERG AN INDEPENDENT IS CONSIDERING A WILD-CARD RUN AFTER SEEING THE RISE OF DONALD TRUMP AND TEXAS SEN. TED CRUZ ON THE RIGHT AND THE PROBLEMS OF HILLARY CLINTON??S CAMPAIGN ON THE LEFT. CLINTON SAID ON NBC??S MEET THE PRESS THAT SHE PLANS TO GET THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION ??SO HE DOESN??T HAVE TO.? HER RISING DEMOCRATIC RIVAL SEN. BERNIE SANDERS SAID A ??CONTEST BETWEEN BILLIONAIRES? BLOOMBERG AND TRUMP WOULD BOLSTER HIS CASE AS THE ONLY CANDIDATE LOOKING OUT FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS. TRUMP ON CBS?? FACE THE NATION SAID HE ??WOULD LOVE? THE CHANCE TO RUN AGAINST BLOOMBERG BECAUSE ??HE'S VERY OPPOSITE ON ME WITH GUNS AND HE'S OPPOSITE ON PRO-LIFE AND HE'S OPPOSITE ON A LOT OF THINGS.? TRUMP MAY HAVE HAD TAME WORDS FOR BLOOMBERG BUT HE HAD A WHOLE LOT MORE TO SAY ABOUT TEXAS SEN. TED CRUZ HIS CHIEF REPUBLICAN COMPETITION IN IOWA WHO ATTACKED TRUMP IN A NEW ATTACK AD. MEET THE PRESS HOST CHUCK TODD PLAYED THE AD WHICH SAYS TRUMP LOVES EMINENT DOMAIN BECAUSE IT ??MADE HIM RICH LIKE WHEN HE COLLUDED WITH ATLANTIC CITY INSIDERS TO BULLDOZE THE HOME OF AN ELDERLY WIDOW.? TRUMP WASTED NO TIME ATTACKING THE AD SUNDAY ON NBC??S MEET THE PRESS. ??I HAVE TO TELL YOU HIS AD IS WRONG BECAUSE I NEVER KNOCKED DOWN THAT HOUSE? TRUMP SAID. ??I WANTED TO GET THAT HOUSE TO BUILD A MAJOR BUILDING THAT WOULD HAVE EMPLOYED TREMENDOUS NUMBERS OF PEOPLE BUT THEN THE WOMAN DIDN'T WANT TO SELL ULTIMATELY I JUST SAID ??FORGET ABOUT IT.?? SO HE'S GOT ME BULLDOZING DOWN A HOUSE I NEVER BULLDOZED IT DOWN. IT'S FALSE ADVERTISING.? TODD SAID ??WELL ALL RIGHT THE ACCUSATION WAS THAT THAT??S WHAT YOU WANTED TO DO.? BUT TRUMP STOOD BY HIS TAKEDOWN SAYING ??NO THE ACCUSATION WAS THAT I DID IT AND I DIDN??T DO IT.\ WE RATE THE CLAIM HALF TRUE.?Ÿ CRUZ??S AD REFERENCES A PERIOD IN THE 1990S PRIOR TO A SUPREME COURT DECIDING EMINENT DOMAIN COULD BE APPLIED TO PRIVATE COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS PUBLIC PROJECTS.?Ÿ TRUMP PLANNED TO BUILD A LIMOUSINE GARAGE TO SERVICE THE TRUMP PLAZA HOTEL AND CASINO IN ATLANTIC CITY N.J. BUT SEVERAL PIECES OF PRIVATE PROPERTY WERE IN THE WAY INCLUDING A HOME OWNED SINCE THE 1960S BY A WIDOW IN HER LATE 60S NAMED VERA COKING. TRUMP HAS SAID HE OFFERED COKING MILLIONS FOR HER PROPERTY BUT SHE WOULDN??T GIVE UP HER HOME. IN 1994 NEW JERSEY??S CASINO REINVESTMENT DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY THREATENED TO USE EMINENT DOMAIN TO SEIZE THE HOUSE. THE DISPUTE ENDED UP IN FRONT OF THE NEW JERSEY SUPERIOR COURT WHICH RULED AGAINST TRUMP AND THE GOVERNMENT IN 1998. AFTER LOSING THE CASE TRUMP GAVE UP HIS PLAN TO BUY COKING??S HOUSE TELLING THE NEW YORK DAILY NEWS THAT HE WAS \""NO LONGER AN INTERESTED BUYER.\"" BOTH CRUZ AND TRUMP ARE STRETCHING THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH A WIDOW??S HOME.

SANDERS?? CLAIM RATES MOSTLY TRUE. THE CLEAREST EXAMPLE COMES FROM A TWEET TRUMP SENT NOV. 6 2012. \""THE CONCEPT OF GLOBAL WARMING WAS CREATED BY AND FOR THE CHINESE IN ORDER TO MAKE U.S. MANUFACTURING NON-COMPETITIVE.\"" THAT CERTAINLY GIVES SANDERS SOME AMMO. TRUMP HAS SOMEWHAT BACKED OFF OF THIS TWEET CALLING THE CHINESE LINK A ??JOKE? ON FOX & FRIENDS THE DAY AFTER SANDERS ATTACKED TRUMP??S CLIMATE CHANGE VIEWS IN THE DEMOCRATIC DEBATE. ??WELL I THINK THE CLIMATE CHANGE IS JUST A VERY VERY EXPENSIVE FORM OF TAX. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE MAKING A LOT OF MONEY? TRUMP SAID. ??AND I OFTEN JOKE THAT THIS IS DONE FOR THE BENEFIT OF CHINA. OBVIOUSLY I JOKE. BUT THIS IS DONE FOR THE BENEFIT OF CHINA BECAUSE CHINA DOES NOT DO ANYTHING TO HELP CLIMATE CHANGE. THEY BURN EVERYTHING YOU COULD BURN THEY COULDN'T CARE LESS.? HE MAY CLAIM HE WAS JOKING ABOUT THE CHINESE INVENTING CLIMATE CHANGE. BUT TRUMP HAS REPEATEDLY CALLED CLIMATE CHANGE A ??HOAX? IN SPEECHES TWEETS AND MEDIA APPEARANCES AND WHILE HE HASN??T REPEATED THE CHARGE THAT CHINA ??INVENTED? CLIMATE CHANGE HE HAS SAID THAT CHINA BENEFITS WHEN THE REST OF THE WORLD TAKES STEPS TO CURB CLIMATE CHANGE.

INSTEAD THE M.E. RULED THE CAUSE OF DEATH AS ??ACCIDENTAL? AS A RESULT OF ??COMPLICATIONS FROM SCHIZOPHRENIA HEART DISEASE AND ??CONFINEMENT? IN THE SHOWER BACK ON JUNE 23 2012. THAT??S ALL THAT CHAPMAN KNOWS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO HIS BROTHER MEDICALLY SPEAKING BECAUSE IT??S TAKEN AN UNBELIEVABLE THREE YEARS FOR THE MEDICAL EXAMINER??S OFFICE TO COMPLETE THEIR REPORT ON RAINEY??S DEATH. NOW THAT IT??S FINALLY FINISHED CHAPMAN HAS BEEN BARRED FROM LEARNING ABOUT THE RESULTS. ??I??M DEEPLY BOTHERED MAN? CHAPMAN SAID. ??THEY??RE PLAYING A GAME HERE. I??M JUST IN THE DARK WITH THIS NOW. THEY DON??T WANT TO COME CLEAN.? WHEN THE DEATH CERTIFICATE CAME IT MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN WRITTEN IN WINGDINGS. ??I HAVE NEVER GOTTEN AN AUTOPSY AND ON HIS DEATH CERTIFICATE IT??S ??DEATH UNKNOWN.? MIAMI-DADE COUNTY MEDICAL EXAMINER DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS DARREN CAPRARA TOLD US THAT THE OPEN CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION HAS HAMSTRUNG THEIR ABILITY TO BE FORTHCOMING. ??WE DON??T COMMENT AT ALL UNTIL THE CASE IS CLOSED? HE SAID. BUT WHY IT TOOK MORE THAN THREE YEARS TO RENDER AN AUTOPSY RESULT? ??WHAT THE MEDICAL EXAMINER DOES IS A DELIBERATE PROCESS THAT INVOLVES MANY AGENCIES AND IT TAKES AS LONG AS IT TAKES? CAPRARA SAID. THEN HE WENT ON AFTER BEING PRESSED ABOUT HOW THE DECEASED BROTHER HAS CALLED THE AGENCY??S HANDIWORK ON RAINEY??S POST MORTEM AN OUTRIGHT COVERUP. ??THIS IS WHAT IT TOOK TO RENDER A DECISION AND TO GET AN ACTUAL REPORT THAT WE STAND BEHIND?? THERE??S A LOT TO IT. THERE??S A LOT OF COMPLICATED THINGS GOING ON? CAPRARA ADDED. SO FAR ONLY FLORIDA ATTORNEY GENERAL PAM BONDI??S OFFICE AND THE MIAMI-DADE POLICE DEPARTMENT HAVE BEEN GRANTED ACCESS THE M.E.??S FINDINGS. OFFICIALS AT BOTH AGENCIES REFUSED TO OFFER ANY MUCH IN TERMS OF ANSWERS. A BONDI SPOKESMAN SAID ??IT WOULD NOT BE APPROPRIATE? CITING THAT RAINEY??S CASE ??IS ACTIVE AND ONGOING.? A DETECTIVE AT THE MIAMI-DADE POLICE DEPARTMENT EMAILED A STATEMENT THAT REFUSING TO OFFER VIDEO RECORDINGS OF RAINEY??S FATAL SHOWER AS IT WOULD BREACH SECURITY AND ??DEPICTS THE DEATH? WHICH IS PROTECTED FROM RELEASE. THE AUTOPSY WILL REMAIN SHIELDED UNTIL THE A.G. COMPLETES A DOCUMENT THEY CALLED A ??CLOSE OUT MEMO.? THE AUTOPSY REPORT PURPORTEDLY CLEARED CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS ROLAND CLARK AND CORNELIUS THOMPSON OF RIGGING THE SHOWER BECAUSE IT WAS ??EXCESSIVELY? HOT ON THE DAY HE DIED AND -- ACCORDING TO THE MIAMI HERALD --THE MEDICAL EXAMINER??S AUTOPSY RESULTS FINDS THAT THE TWO OFFICERS HAD ??NO INTENT? TO HARM THE INMATE WHEN THEY DRAGGED RAINEY SUPPOSEDLY COVERED IN FECES INTO THE SHOWER. A SOURCE CLOSE TO THE INVESTIGATION TOLD THE DAILY BEAST THAT THE INCIDENT WHILE TRAGIC WAS AN ??ANOMALY? AND THAT IT INVOLVED TWO GUARDS AT THE JAIL ??THAT MADE A REALLY STUPID DECISION BUT NEITHER ONE MEANT TO HARM OR KILL DARREN RAINEY? THE SOURCE SAID. ??I THINK THEY MADE A STUPID DECISION AND HE HAD HEALTH ISSUES THAT WERE EXACERBATED.? THE CORRECTIONS OFFICERS IN QUESTION WITH RAINEY??S DEMISE COULD STILL GET HIT WITH MANSLAUGHTER CHARGES IF THE THE MIAMI-DADE STATE ATTORNEY??S OFFICE FINDS ENOUGH EVIDENCE THAT THE STEAMING TWO-HOUR SHOWER WAS DEEMED A CRIMINAL ACT. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS INVESTIGATING THE DEATH OFFICIALS TOLD ?ŸTHE DAILY BEAST. ?ŸLAST YEAR THE FEDS OFFICIALLY BEGAN PROBING THE FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AFTER A 42-YEAR-OLD INMATE NAMED BERNADETTE GREGORY IN 2009 WAS FOUND DEAD HAVING HANGED HERSELF WITH A BEDSHEET. BOTH GUARDS ARE NO LONGER WORKING AT THE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY BUT AT LEAST ONE A SOURCE CONFIRMED IS NOW A COP. THE FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS SAID IT HAS NOT RECEIVED THE M.E.??S FINDINGS BUT VOWED ACTION ONCE THEY ARE PRIVY TO ITS FINDINGS. ??UPON OUR RECEIPT AND EVALUATION OF THIS REPORT THE DEPARTMENT WILL ACT SWIFTLY IN INITIATING ALL APPROPRIATE INVESTIGATIONS AND INTERNAL REVIEWS? A CORRECTIONS SPOKESMAN??S STATEMENT READ. ?Ÿ PERHAPS THE GREATEST TRAGEDY HERE HAS BEEN THE WALL OF SILENCE AND THE FOOT-DRAGGING BY AGENCIES WHO HAVE BEEN TAKING THEIR SWEET TIME TO COMPLETE A KILLER SHOWER. ??IT ALL JUST SNOWBALLS INTO THIS MASSIVE ISSUE BECAUSE NOBODY CAN RAP THIS UP IN A TIMELY MANNER? A SOURCE SAID.??IT ALLOWS PEOPLE??S MINDS TO START RACING WHEN IT REALLY IS JUST TWO PEOPLE DOING SOMETHING STUPID AND INAPPROPRIATE THAT CAUSED THIS ACCIDENT.? THE CIVIL LAWSUIT DESCRIBES RAINEY AS A ??MENTALLY ILL MAN? WHO WAS DIAGNOSED WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA WHICH ??IMPAIRED...RAINEY??S MAJOR LIFE ACTIVITIES.? RAINEY WAS LOCKED UP FOR COCAINE POSSESSION BUT ACCORDING TO THE CIVIL LAWSUIT HE WAS ALSO RIDDLED WITH MENTAL-HEALTH ISSUES. RAINEY WAS ON PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION ??TO MANAGE HIS MENTAL ILLNESS? AND WAS HAVING AN EPISODE THE LAWSUIT SAYS WHEN HE WAS CREATING CHAOS. ??RAINEY WAS DISHEVELED AND HAD POOR FUNCTIONING DISTORTED THINKING AND WAS SMEARING FECES ALL OVER HIS CELL? THE LAWSUIT SAID ADDING HE LATER SMEARED HIS FECES ALL OVER HIS CELL AND ALSO ON HIMSELF. IT WAS A ??MANIFESTATION OF HIS SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS.? INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING PROTOCOLS AND NOTIFYING MENTAL HEALTH STAFFERS TO INTERVENE THE LAWSUIT CONTENDS THE TWO CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS RESORTED TO ??TORTURE AND RETALIATE AGAINST A MENTALLY ILL INMATE ON THE UNIT.? IT??S CALLED ??SHOWER TREATMENT.? A SPECIFIC SHOWER STALL WAS APPARENTLY ??ALTERED OR BROKEN? AND SPRAYED ??SCALDING HOT WATER? IN A LOCKED AREA WHERE INMATES ??CANNOT CONTROL THE PRE-SET WATER OR THE WATER TEMPERATURE.? HOW LONG AN INMATE IS KEPT IN THE SHOWER IS DETERMINED BY THE OMNIPRESENT GUARDS THE LAWSUIT STATES. ??ONCE PLACED INSIDE INMATES CANNOT LEAVE THE SHOWER UNLESS RELEASED BY THE OFFICERS.? ON THIS DAY IT WAS ALLEGEDLY RAINEY??S TURN TO GET THE SHOWER TREATMENT. DEFECATING AND NOT IN HIS RIGHT MIND OFFICERS CLARKE AND THOMPSON ??MALICIOUSLY AND SADISTICALLY TURNED ON SCALDING HOT WATER IN RAINEY??S SHOWER IN RETALIATION FOR [HIS] SMEARING FECES ON HIS BODY AND CELL? THE LAWSUIT CLAIMS. THE GUARDS APPARENTLY TAUNTED RAINEY BUT ACCORDING TO FELLOW INMATE MARK JOINER THEY DISREGARDED RAINER??S SCREAMS BEFORE TAUNTING HIM. ??HE WAS CRYING ??PLEASE STOP PLEASE STOP PLEASE STOP?? JOINER TOLD THE HERALD. THE LAST WORDS RAINEY EVER HEARD WERE SAID TO BE ??ENJOY YOUR SHOWER.? SHRIEKS AND SCREAMS FROM RAINEY WERE IGNORED AS HE BOILED FOR TWO HOURS THE LAWSUIT CLAIMS. FINALLY NURSES DISCOVERED RAINEY ??LYING ON HIS BACK ON THE SHOWER FLOOR? AND HE WAS ??NON-RESPONSIVE HAD NO PULSE AND HAD NO RESPIRATIONS? HE LAWSUIT SAYS. NURSES TRIED TO RESUSCITATE RAINEY TO NO AVAIL. AFTER HE WAS REMOVED RAINEY??S FELLOW INMATE JOINER SAID HE WAS HANDED A BOTTLE OF CLOROX BOTTLE AND TOLD TO SCOOP UP ??LARGE CHUNKS OF HUMAN SKIN? HE TOLD THE HERALD. WHEN CHAPMAN LEARNED THAT HIS BROTHER??S FLESH WAS MELTED OFF HE RANG THE MEDICAL EXAMINER??S OFFICE TO UNDERSTAND THE CONDITION OF HIS BROTHER??S CORPSE BEFORE IT WAS TURNED INTO PAINT CAN FILLED WITH DUST. ??THIS IS 400 MILES AWAY FROM ME? CHAPMAN SAID FROM HIS HOME IN TAMPA BAY. ??IT WAS PRETTY MUCH THEY WANTING TO RUSH ME TO GET ME TO DO SOMETHING WITH HIM. FOR CHAPMAN THE AGONY OF LOSING RAINEY AT THE HANDS OF ??PEOPLE WE??RE SUPPOSED TO TRUST? IS LIKE A MODERN FORM OF A LYNCHING. ??IT??S LIKE BACK IN THE DAYS WHEN MINORITIES WAS BURNED ALIVE? HE SAID. ??BUT THEN IN THIS WORLD HERE THEY PUT HIM IN A HOT SHOWER??WHICH IS JUST AS BAD.? CHAPMAN SAID HE WISHES THE GUARDS COULD GET A TASTE OF THEIR TORTUROUS WAYS. ??HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF SOMEBODY PUT YOUR LOVED ONE IN A SHOWER AND LEFT HIM THERE SCREAMING AND BEGGING: LET ME OUT! I DON??T WANT TO DO IT ANYMORE!? ??I WANT YOU TO TELL ME THAT FACE-TO-FACE HOW YOU WOULD FEEL.? EVER SINCE THE FAMILY HAS BEEN HURTING AND SUFFERING ?ŸFROM BEING TOLD NOTHING BY AUTHORITIES. ??I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHY THERE IS NO JUSTICE IN THIS? CHAPMAN SAID. ??IF I GO AND SHOOT A POLICEMAN THEY GONNA PUT THE MANHUNT ON ME. YET THEY??RE RIGHT THERE DOING THE BAD DEED. AND THEY THINK IT??S OK. THEY DON??T GOT TO ANSWER TO NOBODY. IT DOESN??T MAKE ANY SENSE.? SINCE LEARNING OF THE UNSPEAKABLE SADISTIC TORTURE THAT MAY HAVE KILLED HIS BROTHER CHAPMAN IS DETERMINED TO MAKE SURE THE TRUTH IS SET FREE. ??ALL I HAVE IS MEMORIES? HE SAID ADDING THAT THE AUTHORITIES AFTER THREE YEARS OF SILENCE NEED ??TO COME CLEAN AND STEP FORWARD AND DO THE RIGHT THING.? ANYTHING LESS WILL BE INSULT TO WHAT SOME ACCUSE THE GUARDS OF COMMITTING AN UNSANCTIONED EXECUTION. ??BOTTOM LINE IS WHAT THEY DID ISN??T WHAT YOU DO TO A HUMAN? HE SAID. ??THEY JUST PUT HIM IN THE SHOWER LIKE HE WAS A DOG AND EUTHANIZED HIM. ??THAT??S BASICALLY WHAT THEY WAS DOING. PUTTING HIM DOWN.? ,164322.0

WELL HIM AND RAND PAUL BUT THE PAULS??RAND AND HIS POPS??HAVE ALWAYS HAD BATTALIONS OF NERDS WHO GO ONLINE AND CLICK THEIR NAMES OVER AND OVER AGAIN (ALTHOUGH HE DID DO FINE BUT AT THIS POINT WHAT DOES IT MATTER?). FRANK LUNTZ WAS PUSHING RUBIO HARD ON FOX NEWS LAST NIGHT RIGHT AFTER THE DEBATE ENDED. OUT OF HIS 27-PERSON FOCUS GROUP FULLY 23 SAID RUBIO WON. THEY CALLED HIM ??ASPIRATIONAL? ??HONEST? ??POWERFUL? ??PREPARED? ??ELECTABLE? ??GAME-CHANGER? AND ??POSITIVE.? ONLY THREE WERE SUPPORTING RUBIO COMING IN AFTER THE THING NINE WERE. TO LUNTZ AND HIS PANEL RUBIO??S MOMENT OF GLORY CAME ON IMMIGRATION WHEN THE FLORIDA SENATOR SAID THAT THING ABOUT HOW ??WE ARE NOT GOING TO ROUND UP AND DEPORT 12 MILLION PEOPLE BUT WE??RE NOT GOING TO GO AROUND HANDING OUT CITIZENSHIP CARDS EITHER.? NOW THIS IS ACTUALLY PRETTY PUKEWORTHY BECAUSE ANYONE WHO KNOWS RUBIO??S HISTORY ON THIS KNOWS HE WAS LYING HIS HEAD OFF. THE IMMIGRATION SEGMENT STARTED WITH FOX NEWS PLAYING CLIPS OF RUBIO ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS SUPPORTING A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP WHICH OF COURSE HE DID. THEN??WELL IT WAS ALL A LITTLE CONFUSING BUT RUBIO INTRODUCED THIS CONCEPT OF ??BLANKET AMNESTY? LIKE THIS: ??HAVEN??T YOU ALREADY PROVEN YOU CANNOT BE TRUSTED ON THIS ISSUE?? KELLY ASKED. ??NO BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE QUOTE IT??S VERY SPECIFIC IT SAYS ??BLANKET AMNESTY.?? I DO NOT SUPPORT BLANKET LEGALIZATION??? RUBIO BEGAN. KELLY INTERRUPTED: ??YOU SAID MORE THAN THAT SIR.? ??NO I SAID I DO NOT SUPPORT BLANKET LEGALIZATION? HE SAID. ??YOU SAID EARNED PATH TO CITIZENSHIP IS BASICALLY CODE FOR AMNESTY. YOU SUPPORTED AN EARNED PATH TO CITIZENSHIP? KELLY RESPONDED. ??IT ABSOLUTELY HAS BEEN? RUBIO ATTEMPTED TO CLARIFY. ??AT THE TIME AND CONTEXT OF THAT WAS IN 2009 AND 2010 WHERE THE LAST EFFORT FOR LEGALIZATION WAS AN EFFORT DONE IN THE SENATE AN EFFORT LED BY SEVERAL PEOPLE THAT PROVIDED ALMOST AN INSTANT PATH WITH VERY LITTLE OBSTACLES MOVING FORWARD.? SO ALL RUBIO WAS DENYING WAS THAT HE HAD SUPPORTED ??BLANKET AMNESTY? WHICH I GUESS IS DIFFERENT FROM MERE ??AMNESTY.? THIS IS HOW RUBIO ALWAYS IS: SO CUTE WITH THE PHRASINGS. AND LOOK AT THAT LAST SENTENCE. WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN? HE WAS ONE OF THE CHIEF REPUBLICAN BACKERS OF A BILL THAT INCLUDED NOT ONLY LEGALIZATION BUT A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP BACK IN 2012-13 WHEN HE CALCULATED THAT THAT POSITION WOULD HELP HIM GET TO THE WHITE HOUSE. HE WAS JUST BLATANTLY AND VERY SLEAZILY LYING BUT YOU HAVE TO KNOW SOMETHING TO KNOW THAT AND EVIDENTLY LUNTZ??S PEOPLE KNEW NOTHING. WHAT ELSE HAPPENED? THIS IS ABOUT THE FOURTH TIME IN A ROW THAT TED CRUZ MR. PRINCETON DEBATER WHO YOU??D BETTER LOOK OUT FOR JUST WASN??T THAT GOOD. HE??S JUST SORT OF OFF-POINT A LOT OF THE TIME RARELY QUITE GETTING TO THE HEART OF A MATTER. EVERYBODY SAYS JEB BUSH WAS BETTER THAN USUAL BUT I HAD TROUBLE SEEING IT. CHRIS CHRISTIE WAS HIS USUAL SELF WHICH IS TO SAY HE HAD SOME GOOD APPLAUSE LINES AND A FEW FLAT ONES. BY THE WAY DID YOU KNOW THAT 9/11 REALLY HAD AN IMPACT ON HIM?! TO ME THE CLEAR WINNER WAS MODERATOR BRET BAIER WHO TO MY ASTONISHMENT ACTUALLY ASKED AN INTERESTING IMPORTANT UNEXPECTED NON-GOTCHA QUESTION. I DON??T HAVE THE EXACT WORDING BUT IN ESSENCE: WHAT IF PUTIN DECIDED TO CROSS INTO ESTONIA? UNDER ARTICLE 5 OF NATO WE??D BE OBLIGED TO GO IN THERE AND CONFRONT RUSSIAN TROOPS. WOULD YOU? NOW THAT??S A REAL QUESTION. IT COULD HAPPEN. AND IT??S A TREMENDOUS DILEMMA BECAUSE THE TRUTH WHICH NO REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT WOULD EVER ADMIT IS NO WE??RE NOT GOING TO START A WAR WITH RUSSIA OVER ESTONIA. BUT IF WE DON??T HONOR THE NATO TREATY THEN NATO IS DEAD WHICH IT ARGUABLY OUGHT TO BE ANYWAY. AND WHICH RAISES THE QUESTION OF WHY WE EXPANDED IT INTO THE BALTIC STATES IN THE FIRST PLACE (A GOOD QUESTION FOR HILLARY SINCE HER HUSBAND STARTED US DOWN THAT ROAD). IT??S VERY IMPORTANT STUFF AND I TIP MY HAT TO BAIER. UNFORTUNATELY HE ASKED IT OF BEN CARSON. AFTER HE WOKE UP THE UN-SURGIN?? SURGEON SPOUTED SOME NONSENSE AND WENT BACK TO SLEEP. MEANWHILE THAT MAN ACROSS TOWN STILL DOMINATED THINGS SOMEHOW. THE TIME MAGAZINE ONLINE POLL ON WHO WON THE DEBATE HAD PAUL AT 18 PERCENT RUBIO AT 12 AND CRUZ AT 7 EARLY FRIDAY BUT IT ALSO HAD ??DONALD TRUMP EVEN THOUGH HE SKIPPED IT? AT 53 PERCENT. SO THAT EVIDENTLY IS THAT. TRUMP??S GOING TO WIN IOWA. THERE MIGHT NOW BE AN ACTUAL FIGHT FOR SECOND. I SHOULD STIPULATE THAT RUBIO HAS BEEN DECLARED THE WINNER IN PREVIOUS DEBATES AND IT HASN??T MOVED THE POLLING NEEDLE. BUT LATELY A FEW POLLS SHOW HIM KINDA-SORTA WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE OF CRUZ SEVEN EIGHT PERCENTAGE POINTS BEHIND. IF RUBIO MANAGES TO ECLIPSE CRUZ THAT??S GOING TO CHANGE THE RACE IN A BIG WAY. IT PUTS THE ESTABLISHMENT BACK IN THE GAME AND GIVES THEM ONE CHOICE TO RALLY AROUND. IT??S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT DYNAMIC AND ONE DEMOCRATS DON??T WANT TO SEE. ,10862.0

BUT IN A TOWN THE SIZE OF HESPERIA IT SEEMED EVERYBODY LIVED A FEW BLOCKS AWAY. IN ANY CASE AFTER HE HAD FALLEN SECRETLY IN LOVE K. J. WOULD HURRY HOME AND BACK HIS FATHER??S 15-YEAR-OLD FORD TRUCK OUT OF THE CARPORT DOWN IN FRONT NEAR THE STREET AND THEN JACK IT UP AS IF HE WERE CHANGING A TIRE. AS IF THE PICK-UP WERE HIS.?Ÿ IN A PERFECT WORLD THE WHEEL WAS LIFTING OFF THE GROUND AT THE MOMENT MIYOKO FUJIMORI APPEARED AROUND THE CORNER. HE HAD A STORY READY AGAINST THE POSSIBILITY THAT SHE MIGHT ACTUALLY STOP AND ASK HIM ABOUT HIS TRUCK. SOME DAYS HE JACKED THE TRUCK UP AND DOWN HALF A DOZEN TIMES SO THAT HE WOULD BE SWEATING WHEN SHE CAME BY. NOT WANTING TO LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT. THE CHEERLEADERS PRACTICED THREE TIMES A WEEK AND ON THOSE DAYS MIYOKO RAN AN HOUR LATE USUALLY STILL IN HER UNIFORM CARRYING HER BOOKS IN A BAG OVER HER SHOULDER. CHEERLEADER STRAIGHT-A STUDENT STUDENT COUNCIL LATIN CLUB... K. J. HIMSELF HAD NO PLACE IN PARTICULAR TO BE AFTER SCHOOL.

ONE OF THE HARD THINGS ABOUT GROWING UP IN SMALL TOWNS IS THAT THERE ISN??T MUCH TO DO.?Ÿ VICTORVILLE IS NOT QUITE AS SMALL AS HESPERIA BUT NOBODY HAS EVER MISTAKEN IT FOR TIMES SQUARE. HE FOUND NEW FRIENDS AND SOMETIMES FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN TO BE SOMEPLACE BESIDES VICTORVILLE THEY WENT TO LOS ANGELES ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF SOUTHWEST. ON THE NIGHT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT K. J.

THE FOURTH DANCER A BEAUTIFUL DARK-HAIRED ASIAN WOMAN DANCES TO THE SAME MUSIC BUT FINDS SOMETHING IN IT SLOWER AND MORE SENSUOUS. K. J. CANNOT TAKE HIS EYES OFF HER REMEMBERING THE CHEERLEADER FROM HESPERIA THE YEAR WHEN EVERY AFTERNOON HE WAITED IN THE DRIVEWAY JACKING HIS FATHER??S TRUCK UP AND DOWN HOPING FOR SOMETHING SO FAR OUT OF REACH THAT HE COULDN??T ACTUALLY PUT HIS FINGER ON WHAT IT WAS.

AND KNOWING BY NOW THAT IT DOESN??T HAPPEN LIKE THAT??ALL THE WASTED YEARS??AND KNOWING HE IS STILL DOING THE SAME THING. AND MAYBE IT WAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH LIVING IN A PLACE HE DIDN??T WANT TO LIVE WORKING AT A JOB THAT DIDN??T MEAN ANYTHING. WITH DRINKING SOUTHERN COMFORT AND ROOT BEER THAT HE DIDN??T REALLY WANT TO DRINK SMOKING DOPE THAT HE DIDN??T MUCH WANT TO SMOKE GOING ALONG TO A STRIP CLUB WHERE HE DIDN??T WANT TO BE. AND FOR A FEW SECONDS HE GLIMPSED SOMETHING TRUE??THAT YOU COULD SPEND YOUR WHOLE LIFE WAITING FOR THE BEAUTIFUL DARK-HAIRED ASIAN GIRL TO STOP AND TALK AND IT MIGHT NEVER HAPPEN. AND HE STOOD GAWPING. AND THEN THE MUSIC STOPPED AND THE DANCERS COLLECTED WHAT CLOTHES THEY??D TAKEN OFF AND RAN OFF THE STAGE.?Ÿ K. J. WAITED AND PRETTY SOON THE GIRLS WHO HAD BEEN DANCING CAME OUT TO MINGLE WITH THE AUDIENCE. NOT WEARING MUCH. HE SPOTTED THE BEAUTIFUL ASIAN GIRL AND SHE CAUGHT HIM STARING AND MISUNDERSTANDING HIS INTENTIONS??WHAT WERE HIS INTENTIONS ANYWAY???SHE MADE HER WAY THROUGH THE CROWD. STILL SHY K. J.

A FEW MINUTES OF MEDITATION THERE OUGHT TO ERASE ANY ASSUMPTION THAT AMERICAN VALUES START SOMEWHERE WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI. BUT LET??S NOT STOP THERE. WALK A BLOCK EAST FROM GROUND ZERO AND VISIT ST. PAUL??S CHAPEL WHERE PRESIDENT WASHINGTON PRAYED AND ALEXANDER HAMILTON OFFERED A EULOGY FOR HIS FALLEN REVOLUTIONARY WAR BROTHER-IN-ARMS NATHANAEL GREENE. THE FIRST KNOWN IMAGE OF THE NATIONAL SEAL OF THE UNITED STATES IS THERE AN EAGLE OVER THE NATIONAL MOTTO E PLURIBUS UNUM ??OUT OF MANY ONE.? IT??S A GOOD MESSAGE TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN YOU??RE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. A FEW BLOCKS SOUTH AND WEST AND YOU??LL FIND YOURSELF AT THE CORNER OF WALL AND BROAD STREET WHERE A STATUE OF GEORGE WASHINGTON STANDS ATOP THE STEPS OF FEDERAL HALL. THIS IS WHERE WASHINGTON TOOK THE OATH OF OFFICE AS THE FIRST PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IN APRIL 1789. IT??S ALSO THE SPOT WHERE THE FIRST UNITED STATES CONGRESS CONVENED AND WROTE THE BILL OF RIGHTS WHICH OUGHT TO SYMBOLIZE ENDURING AMERICAN VALUES TO A CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLAR AND U.S. SENATOR. WALK DOWN THE EXPANSE OF BROAD STREET PAST THE STOCK EXCHANGE THAT HAS CREATED SO MUCH WEALTH OVER THE CENTURIES AND MARVEL THAT THIS WAS THE FIRST EXTENDED NEIGHBORHOOD IN AMERICA TO ENJOY THE INNOVATION OF ELECTRIC LIGHT THANKS TO THOMAS EDISON??S ELECTRIC GENERATION PLANT OVER ON PEARL STREET. ONE BLOCK WEST ON BROADWAY STOOD WASHINGTON??S SECOND PRESIDENTIAL MANSION AND HAMILTON??S LAW OFFICES FROM WHICH HE ARGUED SOME OF THE EARLIEST SUPREME COURT CASES AFTER SERVING AS OUR FIRST TREASURY SECRETARY. IF YOU??RE FEELING THIRSTY OR HUNGRY FROM ALL THE WALKING BY ALL MEANS DUCK INTO FRAUNCES TAVERN WHERE WASHINGTON AND THE REVOLUTIONARY OFFICERS CELEBRATED THE SUCCESSFUL END OF THE WAR FOR INDEPENDENCE AFTER EIGHT LONG YEARS. THE RESTAURANT??S OWNER WAS A WEST INDIAN IMMIGRANT LIKE HAMILTON HIMSELF. WASHINGTON TOASTED THE OFFICERS IN 1783 WITH A NICE SUMMATION OF ENDURING VALUES WISHING THE ASSEMBLED THAT ??YOUR LATTER DAYS MAY BE AS PROSPEROUS AND HAPPY AS YOUR FORMER ONES HAVE BEEN GLORIOUS AND HONORABLE.? THE SCOPE OF THE PARTY TOOK SOME OF THE STING OUT OF THE SORROW: THE 120 GUESTS DRAINED 135 BOTTLES OF MADEIRA AND 60 BOTTLES OF BEER. GOOD TIMES AFTER HARD WORK WELL DONE CAN REFLECT AMERICAN VALUES AS WELL. TO BURN OFF THE MEAL WALK SOUTH TOWARD BATTERY PARK ON THE TIP OF MANHATTAN ISLAND. YOU??LL SEE A MASSIVE STONE STRUCTURE THAT WAS ONCE USED AS A U.S. CUSTOMS?? HOUSE (WHERE MOBY DICK AUTHOR HERMAN MELVILLE WORKED): IT??S NOW THE SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN. THE FEDERALIST PAPER AUTHOR AND THE FIRST SUPREME COURT JUSTICE JOHN JAY ONCE LIVED THERE. IN THE TINY PARK AT ITS FEET A STATUE OF KING GEORGE III WAS TOPPLED BY REBELLIOUS CITIZENS AND MELTED INTO MUSKET BALLS TO FIGHT THE BRITISH. DON??T STOP THERE. WALK DOWN THE CENTER OF THE PARK PAST MEMORIALS TO THE DUTCH SETTLERS WHO ESTABLISHED THE CITY IN 1625 AND PAST A BATTERED BRONZE GLOBE THAT ONCE STOOD IN THE CENTER OF THE TWIN TOWERS. ONCE YOU REACH THE WATER??S EDGE YOU??LL BE STARING OUT ONTO NEW YORK HARBOR. IN FRONT OF YOU WILL BE THE STATUE OF LIBERTY AND ELLIS ISLAND SIDE BY SIDE SEPARATED BY A SLIVER OF WATER. THIS IS IT THE WHOLE DEAL: AMERICAN VALUES IN ONE VISTA. INDEPENDENCE AND IMMIGRATION ARE THE TWO CORNERSTONES OF THE AMERICAN CHARACTER THE BALANCE BETWEEN RUGGED INDIVIDUALISM AND THE EVER-EXPANDING COMMUNITY THAT ASKS ONLY FOR THE EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY. FREEDOM OPPORTUNITY DIVERSITY???ŸALL ENABLED BY HARD WORK ???ŸTHAT??S NEW YORK. WE RE-IMAGINE THOSE VALUES FOR EACH GENERATION BUT ONE THING REMAINS THE SAME: THIS IS THE PLACE THAT KIDS FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND THE WORLD COME TO PURSUE THEIR AMERICAN DREAM. SO BEFORE YOU TRY TO TAP INTO ANTI-IMMIGRANT SENTIMENT FOR POLITICAL GAIN OR PRETEND THAT AMERICAN VALUES ARE THE EXCLUSIVE PURVIEW OF ANY REGION OR PEOPLE THINK ABOUT WHETHER YOU WANT TO BE PRESIDENT OR JUST ANOTHER CHEAP POLITICIAN.

BUT HER LAST POST A FEW DAYS BEFORE SHE DIED OF GRAFFITI THAT SAYS ??KISS ME HARD BEFORE YOU GO? MAY BE THE MOST PROPHETIC OF ALL ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER HOW HER BODY WAS DISCOVERED.

HE EITHER DIDN??T SEE OR HE COULDN??T ACCEPT THE EVIDENCE THAT SHE WAS DEAD. THE BODY WAS COLD BUT HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO. HE TRIED IN EVERY WAY FIRST WITH THE MOUTH-TO-MOUTH THEN WITH HEART MASSAGE ?? HE KEPT REPEATING ??MY LITTLE ONE MY LOVE??.? ONE LAST KISS INDEED.?Ÿ THE APARTMENT WAS MODERATELY UNTIDY COLIVICCHI SAID AND INVESTIGATORS TOLD THE DAILY BEAST THAT OLSEN??S BEAGLE SCOUT HAD DEFECATED ON THE FLOOR IN SEVERAL PLACES IMPLYING THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN TAKEN OUT FOR QUITE SOME TIME. THE LANDLADY CALLED THE POLICE WHO SENT OFFICERS AND AN AMBULANCE BUT BY THEN THE CRIME SCENE HAD BEEN SERIOUSLY COMPROMISED. FIORENTINI MOVED AND TOUCHED THE BODY MEANING THERE IS NO FORENSIC RECORD OF THE SCENE BEFORE HE ENTERED AND NO CERTAINTY ABOUT THE EXACT LOCATION AND STATE OF HER BODY IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE MURDER. IF HER BONES ARE BROKEN DID HE DO IT WHEN HE TRIED TO REVIVE HER OR DID THE ASSAILANT DO IT? OR BOTH? PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY HIS INTERFERENCE NOW JUSTIFIES HIS DNA ON HER BODY. POLICE REMOVED OLSEN??S CORPSE ON SATURDAY EVENING BUT GIVEN THE WEEKEND SCHEDULE THE CORONER ONLY GOT AROUND TO CONDUCTING THE AUTOPSY LATE MONDAY AFTERNOON. THE ONLY INFORMATION INVESTIGATORS HAVE RELEASED SO FAR IS THAT HER CAUSE OF DEATH WAS BY ??STRANGULATION WITH A CORD OR BELT OR SCARF.? NO EXACT TIME OF DEATH HAS BEEN RELEASED NO DOUBT TO STOP ANY POTENTIAL SUSPECTS FROM SCRAMBLING FOR AN ALIBI. NOR HAVE INVESTIGATORS RELEASED ANY INFORMATION FROM THE VIDEO FOOTAGE FROM PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECURITY CAMERAS THAT COVER THE HIGH-TRAFFIC AREA WHICH WOULD CLEARLY SHOW OLSEN??S MOVEMENTS AND THOSE OF ANY OTHERS AROUND THE TIME SHE DIED. TOXICOLOGY REPORTS WILL COME LATER TOO BUT INVESTIGATORS DID SAY SHE WAS NOT SEXUALLY ASSAULTED THOUGH THE RESULTS OF THE EXAM THAT WILL EVENTUALLY REVEAL WHETHER SHE HAD SEX IN THE HOURS BEFORE SHE DIED ARE BEING KEPT SECRET FOR NOW. INVESTIGATORS SAY THEY DO NOT HAVE A SUSPECT. ALL EYES WERE INITIALLY ON THE BOYFRIEND WHO IF HE EVENTUALLY PROVES TO BE THE KILLER WOULD BE JUST ONE MORE STATISTIC IN A COUNTRY WHERE FEMICIDE IS RAMPANT. BUT WITHIN 24 HOURS OF THE DISCOVERY OF OLSEN??S BODY INVESTIGATORS HINTED THAT FIORENTINI??S ALIBI WAS SOLID EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVEN??T NAMED AN EXACT TIME OF DEATH AND CERTAINLY HAVE NOT SAID THEY HAVE EXCLUDED ANYONE FROM THEIR INVESTIGATION. SOME SPECULATE THAT IT IS AN ATTEMPT TO TRICK HIM AN OFT-USED TOOL IN THE INVESTIGATIVE ARSENAL OF MOST ITALIAN DETECTIVES. IF HE IS A SUSPECT HE CAN CHOOSE NOT TO SPEAK WITHOUT A LAWYER PRESENT IF HE IS JUST A PERSON WHO IS PRIVY TO THE FACTS HE MAY SPEAK MORE FREELY. INVESTIGATORS ARE ALSO HINTING THAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR ??ANY ACQUAINTANCE? OLSEN MAY HAVE MADE THE NIGHT BEFORE SHE DIED AND HAVE EVEN HINTED OF SOME SORT OF EROTIC GAME GONE WRONG WHICH IS WHAT THE SAME INVESTIGATOR THOUGHT HAPPENED TO MEREDITH KERCHER IN 2007 AND WHICH SEEMS TO BE THE CATCH-ALL INVESTIGATIVE THREAD FOR FOREIGN WOMEN WHO ARE MURDERED IN ITALY IMPLYING THAT VICTIMS WERE NOT ASSUMED TO BE INNOCENTS ABROAD. OLSEN WAS LAST SEEN AT THE MONTECARLA NIGHTCLUB BY CLOSE FRIENDS AT 3 A.M. EARLY FRIDAY MORNING AND HER CELLPHONE (WHICH INCIDENTALLY HAS NOT YET BEEN FOUND) WAS TURNED OFF AT 9 A.M. MORE THAN 24 HOURS BEFORE HER BODY WAS DISCOVERED. THE MONTECARLA IS A CLUB THAT WAS CLOSED DOWN AT LEAST ONCE IN THE LAST YEAR FOR ABETTING THE SALE OF COCAINE ACCORDING TO PUBLIC RECORDS WHICH MEANS NOTHING AT ALL IN THE ABSENCE OF A COMPLETE TOXICOLOGY REPORT ON OLSEN THOUGH LOCAL PRESS HAVE HINTED IT WAS HER FAVORITE HAUNT. THE REASON SHE LIKED THE CLUB IS FAR MORE LIKELY TO BE THAT IT WAS JUST 200 METERS FROM HER APARTMENT. AND SO IN THE ABSENCE OF INVESTIGATIVE NEWS THE STORY COVERAGE IS SPINNING IN A DOWNWARD SPIRAL AS IS OFTEN THE CASE IN ITALY. WHEN OLSEN??S DEATH WAS FIRST REPORTED SHE WAS DESCRIBED AS A PRETTY WELL KNOWN ??AMERICANA? WHO EVERYONE LOVED AND WHO WALKED HER BEAGLE SCOUT AROUND THE BOHEMIAN NEIGHBORHOOD OF OLTRARNO IN FLORENCE. BUT AS THE DAYS HAVE WORN ON SHE HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY DESCRIBED IN THE OFT-REPEATED STEREOTYPIC TERMS OF A ??WILD AMERICAN ABROAD? AND A ??SOCIALITE? WHOSE LATE NIGHT CAROUSING DIDN??T GO UNNOTICED BY THE CONSERVATIVE FLORENTINES. SHE HAS GONE FROM ??PRETTY? TO ??PRIVILEGED? AND FROM ??SWEET? TO ??SEDUCTIVE? IN WHAT INCREASINGLY LOOKS LIKE VICTIM-SHAMING IN A CASE WHERE NO AMOUNT OF PARTYING OR PRIVILEGE SHOULD JUSTIFY SUCH A HORRIFIC MURDER. OLSEN MOVED TO FLORENCE IN 2014 IN SEARCH OF HAPPINESS AND TO START A NEW LIFE NEAR HER FATHER WALTER OLSEN A SUCCESSFUL ARCHITECT AND TEACHER IN FLORENCE. BASED ON HER SOCIAL NETWORKING PROFILE SHE DID FIND THAT HAPPINESS TEMPORARY AS IT WAS. SHE POSTED THE NEWS ??I GOT A ONE WAY TICKET TO ITALY!? ON HER FACEBOOK PAGE IN APRIL 2014. NOW JUST TWO YEARS LATER THAT POST SEEMS MORE LIKE A HAUNTING PREMONITION. ,165581.0

THE ONLY SHAPE WHERE BARBIE COULD NOT BE CONSIDERED THIN IS IN THE CURVY BARBIE THE ONE GETTING THE MOST ATTENTION. AND EVEN CURVY BARBIE DOESN??T SEEM PARTICULARLY HEAVY. I WOULD DOUBT HER BODY MASS INDEX (BMI) WOULD?ŸQUALIFY HER AS OVERWEIGHT AND CERTAINLY NOT AS OBESE WHICH ACCORDING TO THE U.S. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AROUND ONE-THIRD OF AMERICAN ADULTS ARE. THOUGH BORN A FULL-BODIED WOMAN BARBIE IS A CHILD OF THE BABY BOOM PREMIERING IN 1959 AT THE AMERICAN TOY FAIR IN NEW YORK CITY. MATTEL CO-FOUNDER RUTH HANDLER SOUGHT AN ALTERNATIVE TO BABY DOLLS FOR YOUNG GIRLS SO SHE BOUGHT THE RIGHTS TO THE GERMAN BILD LILLIE A DOLL THAT WAS BASED OFF A ??SAUCY HIGH-END CALL GIRL? ACCORDING TO TIME.COM AND SOLD TO GROWN MEN. THAT MODEL EXPLAINS BARBIE??S FAMOUSLY SEXY PHYSIQUE: ITTY-BITTY WAIST FEET SO TINY THEY LOOKED LIKE A PRODUCT OF CHINESE FOOT-BINDING PERFECTLY-ROUND ASS AND OF COURSE BREASTS THAT WOULD MAKE JANE RUSSELL JEALOUS. LITTLE GIRLS GREW UP IDOLIZING BARBIE AS THE PERFECT WOMAN THE ULTIMATE MODEL OF FEMININE BEAUTY WITH HER IMPOSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE BODY. AND THEN SOME OF THESE LITTLE GIRLS GREW UP INTO FEMINISTS WHO WERE REPULSED BY THE UNREALISTIC PHYSICAL STANDARDS THAT BARBIE TACITLY PROMOTED AND QUESTIONED WHAT IF ANY PROFESSIONAL AMBITIONS SHE FOSTERED (THOUGH BARBIE??S WEBSITE BOASTS SHE ??BROKE THE ??PLASTIC CEILING?? IN THE 1960S WHEN AS AN ASTRONAUT SHE WENT TO THE MOON??FOUR YEARS BEFORE NEIL ARMSTRONG?). BARBIE HAS SERVED IN A WIDE-RANGE OF PROFESSIONS FROM OB-GYN (I HAD THIS ONE) TO POLICE OFFICER TO PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. AND BARBIE EVEN DITCHED KEN THAT OL?? BALL-AND-CHAIN TO HACK IT AS A SINGLE LADY FOR AT LEAST A FEW YEARS. BUT THE FAMOUS BARBIE BUILD THAT SO RANKLED PARENTS CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR CHILDREN??S SENSE OF BODY IMAGE DIDN??T REALLY CHANGE??UNTIL NOW. THE PRESSURE ON BARBIE TO CHANGE HER LOOK HAS BECOME A MODERN CONSTANT. INVOKING A STUDY BRANDY ZADROZNY NOTED IN THE DAILY BEAST IN 2014 THAT BARBIE??S BAD RAP WAS CATCHING UP TO HER. ??BARBIE ACTUALLY WEAKENS A GIRL??S CAREER AMBITION? ZADROZNY WROTE DESCRIBING AN OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY STUDY THAT SHOWED ??GIRLS WHO WERE GIVEN BARBIES TO PLAY WITH THOUGHT THEY COULD DO FEWER ??BOY JOBS?? THAN GIRLS WHO PLAYED WITH MRS. POTATO HEAD.? AT THAT POINT BARBIE??S POPULARITY WAS ALREADY PLUMMETING SALES HAD PEAKED IN 2002. ALMOST EXACTLY A YEAR AGO IN JANUARY 2015 MATTEL??S BOARD FIRED ITS CEO BRYAN STOCKTON BECAUSE BARBIE??S POPULARITY HAD PLUMMETED WITH A 59 PERCENT DROP IN EARNINGS OVER THE LAST QUARTER OF 2014. AS COMMENTATORS HAVE ALREADY NOTED THE NEW BODY OPTIONS FOR BARBIE SEEM TO BE A RESPONSE TO SLUMPING SALES AND YEARS OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT HER IMPLAUSIBLY ??PERFECT? PHYSIQUE. PERSONALLY AS SOMEONE WHO GREW UP PLAYING WITH BARBIES AND LOVING THEM FAR BEYOND THE TIMEFRAME OF SOCIAL ACCEPTABILITY (NOTE TO 12-YEAR-OLD SELF: DO NOT INVITE MIDDLE SCHOOL PEERS OVER TO PLAY WITH BARBIES) I??M AMBIVALENT ABOUT THE BARBIE BODY REBOOT. BASED ON MY OWN EXPERIENCES I WAS SUSPECT OF HOW BAD BARBIE WAS FOR CHILDREN. EVEN AS A GROWN WOMAN WITH ENOUGH BODY IMAGE ISSUES TO KEEP A THERAPIST IN BUSINESS UNTIL NORTH WEST IS OLD ENOUGH TO START HER OWN TWITTER BATTLE I CAN??T BLAME BARBIE FOR THESE INSECURITIES. WHEN I WAS GROWING UP IT DIDN??T TAKE LONG TO REALIZE I WAS OVERWEIGHT AND LOOKED DIFFERENT FROM SOME UNREALISTIC FEMININE BEAUTY IDEAL BUT THAT HAD MORE TO DO WITH THE WOMEN I OBSESSED OVER IN POP CULTURE??THE SVELTE LADIES OF FRIENDS THE TONED WOMEN OF THE SPICE GIRLS (THEIR FITNESS WAS CLEARLY NOT EXCLUSIVE TO SPORTY)??AND OF COURSE TEASING CLASSMATES. SARAI WALKER AN EXPERT ON FEMALE BODY IMAGE PRESSURES AND AUTHOR OF 2015??S DIETLAND AN ACCLAIMED FEMINIST NOVEL ABOUT A WOMAN WHO REBELS AGAINST SOCIETAL PRESSURES ON WOMEN TO LOSE WEIGHT SAID SHE ALSO GREW UP LOVING BARBIE. ??I PLAYED WITH BARBIE AND I GREW UP INTO THIS FEMINIST WRITER AND WROTE A RADICAL NOVEL ABOUT FEMINISM? WALKER TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. ??IT??S HARD TO KNOW HOW BARBIE AFFECTED ME BUT I DO THINK SHE??S BECOME THE SYMBOL OF OUR PROTESTS AGAINST BODY IDEALS AND OBJECTIFICATION? SHE SAID. HOWEVER WALKER WAS ALSO AMBIVALENT ABOUT HOW MUCH OF THE ONUS OF BODY-SHAMING SHOULD BE THRUSTED ON BARBIE. ??SHE??S A CONVENIENT VILLAIN? WALKER SAID. ??SHE??S A SYMPTOM OF A MUCH LARGER PROBLEM. SO MANY THINGS PLAY INTO IT NOT JUST BARBIE.? WALKER WAS DUBIOUS OF HOW DRAMATIC A CHANGE THESE BARBIE SHAPES ESPECIALLY THE CURVY ONE MARKED. SURE CURVY BARBIE IS AT LEAST A BIT MORE AMPLE BUT SHE??S MORE LIKE A (SOMEWHAT) ENLARGED VERSION OF HER DROOLED-OVER HOURGLASS FIGURE. IN SHORT BARBIE??S BODY STILL MEETS THE CONVENTIONAL STANDARDS FOR FEMALE PHYSICAL BEAUTY. ??SHE DOESN??T THREATEN THE STATUS QUO? WALKER SAID. ??SOMEONE WHO IS CURVY IS PLUS-SIZED BUT ACCEPTABLE? WALKER NOTED. ??SHE [BARBIE] DOESN??T LOOK ALL THAT DIFFERENT FROM THE TRADITIONAL BARBIE. SHE??S KIND OF LIKE CHRISTINA HENDRICKS??LARGER THAN WHAT WE??RE USED TO SEEING ON TV BUT MEN STILL SWOON OVER HER.? WALKER HAS A DIFFERENT IDEA OF WHAT A TRULY REVOLUTIONARY BARBIE WOULD BE. ??I DON??T KNOW IF MATTEL COULD EVER MAKE A DOLL WHOSE MAIN PURPOSE WASN??T TO BE CUTE AND ATTRACTIVE TO BOYS AND MEN. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THEM DARE TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT.? IT MAY BE A FANTASY TO EXPECT MATTEL OR ANY TOY COMPANY TO START PRODUCING DOLLS THAT AREN??T JUST EXPANDING CONCEPTIONS OF BEAUTY BUT RATHER ROOTED IN TELLING GIRLS (AND BOYS) THAT WORRYING ABOUT WHETHER PEOPLE THINK YOU??RE BEAUTIFUL PRETTY OR HOT IS SUPERFICIAL BUNK. BUT IF BARBIE CAN BEAT ARMSTRONG TO THE MOON THAN MAKING SUCH A DOLL SHOULD BE CHILD??S PLAY. ,8204.0

THE PROBLEM THIS TIME??THE RADAR-EVADING PLANE'S EIGHT MILLION LINES OF COMPUTER CODE AMOUNTING TO ARGUABLY THE MOST COMPLEX SOFTWARE SUITE EVER INSTALLED ON A WARPLANE. THE CODE DELAY IS THE LATEST??AND POSSIBLY MOST DAMAGING??SETBACK FOR THE PENTAGON'S AMBITIOUS AND CONTROVERSIAL PLAN TO REPLACE ALMOST ALL OF ITS AIR FORCE NAVY AND MARINE CORPS FIGHTERS WITH THREE DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE F-35 AT A COST OF MORE THAN A TRILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT 50 YEARS. DAMAGING BECAUSE THE MILITARY AND F-35-MAKER LOCKHEED MARTIN HAVE INCREASINGLY SOLD THE F-35 AS A SORT OF \FLYING COMPUTER\"" WHOSE SOFTWARE CAN OUTTHINK ENEMY PILOTS EVEN WHEN THE ENEMY'S OWN PLANES FLY FASTER MANEUVER BETTER AND CARRY MORE WEAPONRY THAN THE F-35 DOES. THE STEALTH FIGHTER'S SOFTWARE IS ITS LAST POSSIBLE CLAIM TO BEING A FIRST-CLASS WARPLANE. IF THE F-35'S CODE DOESN'T WORK THEN NEITHER DOES THE F-35. SADDLED WITH THOUSANDS OF DYSFUNCTIONAL F-35S THE PENTAGON COULD LOSE COMMAND OF THE AIR. J. MICHAEL GILMORE THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT'S TOP WEAPONS-TESTER WARNED ABOUT THE SCHEDULE SLIP IN A DEC. 11 MEMO. \""THE CURRENT \""OFFICIAL SCHEDULE\"" TO COMPLETE FULL DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF ALL BLOCK 3F CAPABILITIES BY 31 JULY 2017 IS NOT REALISTIC\"" CARTER WROTE REFERRING TO THE SOFTWARE UPDATE OR \""BLOCK\"" THAT'S SUPPOSED TO GIVE THE F-35 THE BASIC ABILITY TO USE ITS SENSORS AND SOME WEAPONS??ALBEIT WITH LIMITATIONS.?Ÿ ACCORDING TO GILMORE THE BLOCK 3F CODE DELAY IS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE F-35 DEVELOPERS' RUSH TO INSTALL THE EARLIER BLOCK 2B SOFTWARE WHICH IS SUITABLE ONLY FOR TESTING AND TRAINING BUT IS SUPPOSED TO FORM THE BASIS OF THE LATER COMBAT-READY CODE. THE DEVELOPERS' HURRY WITH BLOCK 2B RESULTED IN \""POOR PERFORMANCE\"" THAT SLOWED PROGRESS ON SUBSEQUENT CODE. REALISTICALLY THERE ARE ONLY TWO WAYS TO FIX THE BLOCK 3F SOFTWARE GILMORE NOTED. ONE IS TO TRIPLE THE PACE OF TESTING. BUT CAVING TO BUDGET CUTS AND THE ENORMOUS??SOME MIGHT SAY OVERWHELMING??CHALLENGE OF DEVELOPING A JACK-OF-ALL-TRADES STEALTH FIGHTER LOCKHEED AND THE MILITARY ARE ACTUALLY PLANNING ON SLOWING TESTING BY TWO-THIRDS. THE SECOND POSSIBLE SOLUTION IS TO STRIP SOME FEATURES FROM THE BLOCK 3F SOFTWARE??SAY COMPATIBILITY WITH CERTAIN HIGH-TECH WEAPONS??AND WAIT TO ADD THOSE CAPABILITIES BACK TO THE F-35 ON LATER SOFTWARE BLOCKS. BUT EITHER OPTION MEANS A \""VERY HIGH RISK OF FAILING\"" WHEN THE F-35 WITH BLOCK 3F CODE UNDERGOES ITS DEVELOPMENTAL FINAL EXAM IN 2018 GILMORE WARNED. IN A MOVE WITH MORE PUBLIC-RELATIONS VALUE THAN MILITARY UTILITY IN JULY THE MARINE CORPS DECLARED A SINGLE SQUADRON OF F-35S COMBAT-READY WITH THE BLOCK 2B SOFTWARE. THE AIR FORCE PLANS TO DECLARE A SQUADRON COMBAT-READY IN LATE 2016 WITH AN INTERIM SOFTWARE CALLED BLOCK 3I BUT THE FLYING BRANCH IS WAITING UNTIL THE BLOCK 3F CODE IS READY BEFORE IT CLEARS ITS F-35 SQUADRONS TO DEPLOY TO THE MOST DANGEROUS CONFLICT ZONES. AND RUSHING THE BLOCK 3F SOFTWARE COULD HAVE THE SAME DELETERIOUS EFFECT ON THE NEXT BATCH OF CODE THAT RUSHING THE BLOCK 2B SOFTWARE HAD ON BLOCK 3F. IF THE F-35 DEVELOPERS CAN'T GET THE CURRENT SOFTWARE UPDATE RIGHT THEY RISK DERAILING THE STEALTH FIGHTER'S ENTIRE DEVELOPMENT. IT'S NO EXAGGERATION TO SAY THAT THE FUTURE OF U.S. AIR POWER RESTS ON THESE EIGHT MILLION LINES OF CODE. THERE'S A THIRD POTENTIAL FIX THAT GIMORE DIDN'T MENTION IN HIS MEMO. THE PENTAGON COULD PRESERVE THE BLOCK 3F'S FEATURES SUSTAIN OR INCREASE THE PACE OF TESTING AND DELAY THE FINAL EXAM IN ORDER TO GIVE THE MILITARY'S CODERS ENOUGH TIME TO FINISH THE SOFTWARE AND FINISH IT RIGHT. THE PROBLEM IS CONGRESS WHICH IN 2012 PRESSURED THE AIR FORCE TO HAVE SOME F-35S READY FOR COMBAT NO LATER THAN DECEMBER 2016. AIR FORCE LEADERS HAD WANTED TO WAIT UNTIL 2018 AT THE EARLIEST FOR ANY DECLARATION BUT WERE WARY OF \""THE NEGATIVE CONNOTATION\"" OF \""BEING TWO YEARS BEHIND THE MARINES\"" WITH CONGRESS BREATHING DOWN THEIR NECKS ACCORDING TO THE FLYING BRANCH'S OFFICIAL HISTORY FOR 2013. SO THE GENERALS APPROVED THE CURRENT SCHEDULE WITH ITS INTERIM SOFTWARE BLOCK AND HARD 2018 DEADLINE FOR THE FINAL EXAM. DELAYING THE F-35'S WAR-READINESS WOULD LOOK BAD FOR THE AIR FORCE. BUT FAILING THE FINAL EXAM??OR SENDING UNREADY F-35S INTO COMBAT??WOULD LOOK EVEN WORSE. """,47632.0

THAT RIFT IS JUST THE SURFACE OF A MUCH DEEPER DIVISION REFLECTING THE POLARIZATION OF CHRISTIAN LIFE IN THE 21ST CENTURY. THE ANGLICAN COMMUNION WHICH BEGAN AS THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND UNDER HENRY VIII IS NOW A GLOBAL NETWORK SPANNING 165 COUNTRIES. THERE ARE ABOUT 85 MILLION ANGLICANS IN THE WORLD INCLUDING ABOUT 2 MILLION EPISCOPALIANS MOSTLY IN THE U.S. AS OF THIS WEEK HOWEVER THOSE EPISCOPALIANS ARE SECOND-CLASS ANGLICANS: MEMBERS CANNOT VOTE IN ANY ANGLICAN COMMUNION DECISIONS ON CHURCH DOCTRINE AND CANNOT REPRESENT THE COMMUNION IN ANY INTERFAITH BODIES. ESSENTIALLY FOR THREE YEARS EPISCOPALIANS ARE ANGLICANS WITHOUT ANY STANDING IN THEIR OWN CHURCH. THE SUSPENSION TOOK PLACE AT A MEETING OF ??PRIMATES? THE ARCHBISHOPS AND OTHER LEADERS REPRESENTING THE 44 CONSTITUENT CHURCHES OF THE ANGLICAN COMMUNION. THE REASON FOR SUSPENSION CAME LAST JUNE WHEN THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH REMOVED DOCTRINAL LANGUAGE DEFINING MARRIAGE AS BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN AND AUTHORIZED MARRIAGE RITES FOR SAME-SEX COUPLES. WHILE IT??S STILL UP TO INDIVIDUAL CHURCHES WHETHER TO SOLEMNIZE SAME-SEX UNIONS BUT THE VOTE FORMALLY ALLOWED THEM TO DO SO. ACCORDING TO THE PRIMATES THESE ACTIONS WERE IMPROPER BECAUSE THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH ACTED ON ITS OWN. ??SUCH UNILATERAL ACTIONS? THE PRIMATES SAID IN THEIR OFFICIAL STATEMENT ARE ??A DEPARTURE FROM THE MUTUAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND INTERDEPENDENCE IMPLIED THROUGH BEING IN RELATIONSHIP WITH EACH OTHER IN THE ANGLICAN COMMUNION.? ACCORDING TO SOME EPISCOPAL LEADERS THAT IS BUNK. NATIONAL CHURCH BODIES ROUTINELY MAKE DOCTRINAL DECISIONS ON THEIR OWN. (SOME ANGLICAN CHURCHES STILL DO NOT ORDAIN WOMEN FOR EXAMPLE.) WHAT THIS IS REALLY ABOUT IS HOMOSEXUALITY??AND WHAT THAT IS REALLY ABOUT IS WHAT KIND OF CHURCH THE ANGLICAN COMMUNION IS TODAY. THE ANSWER FOR DECADES NOW IS A DIVIDED ONE. UNTIL THE 19TH CENTURY THE ANGLICAN CHURCH WAS??AS THE NAME IMPLIES??BASICALLY BRITISH AND HEADED OFFICIALLY BY THE BRITISH MONARCH. WITH THE SPREAD OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE HOWEVER CAME THE SPREAD OF ANGLICANISM TO ALL CORNERS OF THE WORLD. BY THE END OF THE CENTURY THE CONTEMPORARY ANGLICAN COMMUNION CAME INTO BEING INCLUDING NOT ONLY THE CHURCHES OF ENGLAND SCOTLAND AND IRELAND BUT ALSO THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH AND CHURCHES IN ??PROVINCES? ACROSS THE WORLD. TWO MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS CREATED THE SCHISM FACING THE CHURCH TODAY: THE LIBERALIZATION OF THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH AND THE GROWTH IN POWER AND NUMBERS OF AFRICAN ASIAN AND SOUTH AMERICAN ONES. GEORGE WASHINGTON WAS AN EPISCOPALIAN. SO WERE MADISON MONROE FDR AND SEVEN OTHER PRESIDENTS??ELEVEN IN TOTAL. AND IN THE 19TH AND 20TH CENTURIES THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH WAS PERHAPS THE LEADING CHRISTIAN DENOMINATION IN AMERICA. DURING THIS TIME EPISCOPALIANISM EMBODIED AMERICAN PROPRIETY AND UPPER-CLASS VALUES??CONSERVATIVE BUT REASONABLE. J.P. MORGAN GERALD FORD GEORGE H.W. BUSH. PRIM CHURCH SERVICES WITHOUT THE CATHOLIC ??SMELLS AND BELLS? BUT WITH THE DECORUM AND HIERARCHY. V-NECK SWEATERS PEARLS AND COUNTRY CLUBS. THAT BEGAN TO CHANGE IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS ERA. AFRICAN AMERICAN PARISHES HAD BEEN AROUND SINCE THE 1850S BUT OFTEN SEPARATE BUT (UN-)EQUAL. IN 1958 THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH??S GENERAL CONVENTION PASSED A RESOLUTION AFFIRMING ??THE NATURAL DIGNITY AND VALUE OF EVERY MAN OF WHATEVER COLOR OR RACE AS CREATED IN THE IMAGE OF GOD.? OVER THE OBJECTIONS OF SOUTHERN LEADERS THE CHURCH BEGAN TO TAKE SIDES IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS STRUGGLES OF THE TIME. THE CHANGE WAS GRADUAL AND UNEVEN BUT BY THE END OF 1970S LIBERALS HAD THE UPPER HAND AND CONSERVATIVES HAD MOSTLY LEFT OFTEN TO JOIN THE NEWLY-MINTED CHRISTIAN RIGHT MADE UP LARGELY OF EVANGELICALS BAPTISTS AND CATHOLICS. WOMEN WERE ORDAINED AS PRIESTS IN 1976 AND AS BISHOPS IN 1989. PRIM CHURCH SERVICES STARTED TO LOOSEN UP. BY THE 1990S THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH HAD CHANGED FROM THE STARCHY DENOMINATION OF ROCKEFELLER REPUBLICANS TO A SMALLER DENOMINATION OF (MOSTLY) LIBERALS. AT THE SAME TIME THE REST OF THE ANGLICAN COMMUNION WAS CHANGING RADICALLY WITH ADHERENTS IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH COMING TO OUTNUMBER THOSE IN EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA. THE CHURCHES IN BRITISH COMMONWEALTH COUNTRIES EMERGED IN DIFFERENT SOCIAL CONTEXTS WITH DIFFERENT VALUES AND DIFFERENT (OFTEN HOSTILE) RELATIONSHIPS TO LIBERALISM. MOREOVER THEY FOUND THEMSELVES COMPETING WITH EVANGELICAL INROADS CONSERVATIVE (UNTIL TWO YEARS AGO) CATHOLICISM AND ISLAM WITH THE MOST PIOUS-SEEMING RELIGIOUS TRADITION OFTEN ??WINNING.? FOR ALL THESE REASONS AND MORE THE EMERGENT ANGLICANISM OF THE GLOBAL SOUTH WAS A FAR MORE CONSERVATIVE ANGLICANISM EVEN THAN THE OLD EPISCOPALIANISM LET ALONE THE NEW ONE. ?ŸTHE WATERSHED MOMENT CAME AT AN IMPORTANT ANGLICAN CONFERENCE IN 1998 WHEN THEOLOGICAL CONSERVATIVES FROM AFRICA ASIA AND LATIN AMERICA DEFEATED THE LIBERALS ON A KEY VOTE: HOMOSEXUALITY. ARGUABLY THE SPLIT WE SAW THIS WEEK IS JUST A LATER STAGE OF THE PROCESS BEGUN 18 YEARS AGO. HOMOSEXUALITY IS THE CATALYST BUT NOT THE ONLY CONTENTIOUS ISSUE. TO LIBERALS THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH IS MOVING INTO THE 21ST CENTURY SETTING ASIDE BIBLICAL FUNDAMENTALISM AND RESPONDING TO HOW PEOPLE ACTUALLY LIVE THEIR LIVES. BUT TO ANGLICAN CONSERVATIVES THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH HAS LOST ITS WAY MOVING TOWARD A MUSHY UNIVERSALISM THAT DOWNPLAYS CHRISTIAN EXCLUSIVITY IN FAVOR OF PLURALISM AND TAKES LIBERAL POSITIONS ON ABORTION LGBT EQUALITY AND OTHER HOT-BUTTON ISSUES. PERHAPS THE GREAT OPEN QUESTION IN AMERICAN RELIGION IS WHETHER LIBERAL DENOMINATIONS LIKE EPISCOPALIANISM HAVE A FUTURE OR NOT. (AS JACK JENKINS AT THINKPROGRESS NOTED PRESBYTERIANISM??DONALD TRUMP??S DENOMINATION??IS EVEN MORE LIBERAL THAN THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH AND PRESBYTERIAN LEADERS HAVE FREQUENTLY CRITICIZED TRUMP??S POSITIONS ON IMMIGRATION AND ISLAM.) AMERICAN CHRISTIANITY IN GENERAL IS IN A PERIOD OF STEEP DECLINE AND MAINLINE PROTESTANT DENOMINATIONS??PLUS WHITE NON-HISPANIC CATHOLICS??ARE DECLINING THE MOST. WE ARE MOVING TOWARD A RELIGIOUSLY POLARIZED AMERICA. THIRTY PERCENT OF AMERICANS BETWEEN THE AGES OF 18-29 PROFESS ??NONE? AS THEIR RELIGIOUS AFFILIATION WHILE AT THE OTHER EXTREME AROUND 35 PERCENT OF AMERICANS SUBSCRIBE TO A RESURGENT ULTRA-FUNDAMENTALIST EVANGELICALISM. (77 PERCENT OF THOSE EVANGELICALS BELIEVE WE??RE LIVING IN THE END TIMES.) MAINLINE PROTESTANTS ONCE THE DOMINANT RELIGIOUS GROUP IN AMERICA ARE NOW JUST 18 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION. EPISCOPALIANS ARE LESS THAN 1 PERCENT. TO THE EXTENT RELIGION CONTINUES TO PROVIDE A SOURCE OF INSPIRATION COMMUNITY PURPOSE AND ETHICAL MOTIVATION IN PEOPLE??S LIVES LIBERAL CHRISTIANITY SHOULD HAVE A LOT TO OFFER SEEING AS IT PROVIDES THOSE THINGS WITHOUT PREPOSTEROUS BELIEFS DIVISIVE SOCIAL MORES OR FIRE-BREATHING SERMONS. AND IT DOES TO MANY. BUT EVEN THOUGH 92 PERCENT OF AMERICANS SAY THEY BELIEVE IN GOD THEY SEEM UNINTERESTED IN EXPRESSING THAT BELIEF IN MODERATE REASONABLE CHURCHES. THE AMERICAN RELIGIOUS LANDSCAPE THEN RESEMBLES THE ANGLICAN COMMUNION AS A WHOLE. ON ONE END A SHRINKING NUMBER OF RELIGIOUS LIBERALS AND AT THE OTHER A FIERCE RELIGIOUS CONSERVATISM. IN COMING APART AT THE SEAMS THE ANGLICAN CHURCH LOOKS A LOT LIKE US. ,19396.0

HE LANDED SOME APPLAUSE LINES THAT SOUNDED LIKE THEY COULD HAVE BEEN ISSUED FROM TRUMP??S MOUTH AND TOLD THE DAILY BEAST THAT THE MILITIA MEMBERS OCCUPYING A REFUGE ON FEDERAL LAND IN OREGON HAD GOOD REASON TO DO SO. ??I THINK THERE??S PROBABLY LEGITIMACY? CARSON TOLD THE DAILY BEAST WHEN ASKED IF SUPPORTED THE CAUSE OF THE MILITIA. ??I HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN OUT PUBLICLY ABOUT THE FACT THAT I THINK IT??S RIDICULOUS THAT THE GOVERNMENT OWNS SO MUCH LAND AND THAT WE SHOULD ENACT A PROGRAM WHERE THE GOVERNMENT GRADUALLY BEGINS TO RESTORE THAT LAND TO THE STATES. ? HE ADDED??THERE??S A REASONABLE AND RATIONAL WAY TO DO IT.? CARSON HAS PREVIOUSLY STATED THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OWNS 2.4 BILLION ACRES OF LAND. THE UNITED STATES IS ONLY 2.3 BILLION ACRES IN SIZE. ??I THINK RIGHT NOW THE GOVERNMENT IS HANDLING IT THE RIGHT WAY BY NOT BEING CONFRONTATIONAL? HE ADDED. THE EVENT WAS ANNOUNCED ?ŸLATE ON DECEMBER 31 IN THE MIDST OF HIS CAMPAIGN GOING INTO SELF-DESTRUCTION MODE WITH TOP-RANKING STAFFERS RESIGNING ON NEW YEARS EVE. CARSON CLAIMED HE HAD MEETINGS IN NEW YORK WHICH PROMPTED HIM TO STICK AROUND DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE PRIMARY FOR THE STATE IS THREE MONTHS AWAY. SUPPORTERS AT THE EVENT RESEMBLED CALMER ILK OF CLIENTELE THAN THE PEOPLE WHO OFTEN SHOW UP TO TRUMP RALLIES READY TO PROTEST OR THROW PROTESTERS OUT. ??HE??S A GENIUS? 30-YEAR-OLD KRISTEN PARENTE TOLD THE DAILY BEAST BEFORE CARSON BEGAN. SHE HADN??T DECIDED ON A CANDIDATE AND SAID SHE WANTED TO GET A CHANCE TO HEAR CARSON SPEAK EXTENSIVELY BECAUSE THE RACE ??IS JUST A PISSING MATCH BETWEEN EVERYONE RIGHT NOW.? OTHERS WERE SEEMINGLY ON THE FENCE AS WELL. ROBERT CUTRONA 77 SAID THAT HE WAS LOOKING AT ALL THE CANDIDATES AND THAT BESIDES CARSON HE IS INTERESTED IN MARCO RUBIO. WHILE CUTRONA THOUGHT CARSON??S LACK OF FOREIGN POLICY EXPERIENCE MIGHT HELP THE CANDIDATE IN THE LONG RUN BECAUSE HE WOULD - IN THEORY - ASSEMBLE A CRACK TEAM TO ADVISE HIM CUTRONA SAID THE TROUBLE IN CARSON??S OWN RANKS MAKES HIM THINK ??THERE MAY BE MORE PROBLEMS WE DON??T KNOW ABOUT.? CARSON DIDN??T SEEM TO BE SHAKEN BY THE SUDDEN RESIGNATIONS OF HIS STAFFERS THOUGH IF ANYTHING HE APPEARED AS IF A WEIGHT HAD BEEN LIFTED AS HE JOSTLED BETWEEN TALK OF HIS NEW TAX PLAN THE THREAT OF ISIS AND EDUCATION WHICH OCCUPIED A GREAT DEAL OF THE SPEECH. ??THE BEST EDUCATED PEOPLE ARE HOMESCHOOLERS? CARSON DECLARED. ??YOU GET A GOOD EDUCATION YOU WRITE YOUR OWN TICKET? A SIMILAR REFRAIN TO THE STORY OF HIS OWN EDUCATIONAL PATH. THESE TYPES OF CLAIMS NO MATTER HOW UNFOUNDED THEY MAY BE DIDN??T EVEN STOP SKEPTICS LIKE PARENTE FROM RUSHING UP TO CARSON AMONG THE BOOK-CARRYING AUDIENCE MEMBERS WHO WAITED FOR A CHANCE TO TAKE A SELFIE. STILL WHILE THE TALES OF HIS LIFE STORY WERE DECIDEDLY CARSON THE MOMENTS THAT ENGAGED THE CROWD THE MOST WERE THOSE IN WHICH THE RETIRED NEUROSURGEON SOUNDED A BIT LIKE TRUMP AND HIS SUPPORTERS STARTED TO FOLLOW SUIT. ??WE??RE DEALING WITH DIRTY PEOPLE SO WE CAN DO DIRTY THINGS? HE SAID ABOUT ISIS A LINE WHICH COULD HAVE COME RIGHT FROM TRUMP??S PLAYBOOK. DURING THE Q&A SESSION WHICH FOLLOWED HIS SPEECH HE SHUT DOWN A PERSON IN THE AUDIENCE QUESTIONING THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF CARSON??S CLAIM THAT MUSLIMS SHOULDN??T BE PRESIDENT. THIS DREW THE LOUDEST APPLAUSE OF THE NIGHT PROMPTING ONE WOMAN NEARBY TO YELL ??TAKE THAT MUHAMMAD.? ,9821.0

IT WILL CHANGE PROFOUNDLY THE POLITICS ON THE ISLAND AND IN THE PROCESS EVOKE EXTREME CONCERNS IN BEIJING WHICH HAS ENOUGH TO WORRY ABOUT THESE DAYS. JUST AT THE MOMENT THAT BEARS ARE EATING UP CHINA??S STOCK MARKET AS MONEY CONTINUES TO FLOOD OUT OF CHINA WITH BEIJING??S BAD-BOY CLIENT IN NORTH KOREA PLAYING WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONS LIKE A CHILD WITH MATCHES AND THE NATIONS AROUND THE SOUTH CHINA SEA PULLING TOGETHER TO PUSH BACK AGAINST BEIJING??S EXPANSIONIST DESIGNS THERE??NOW TAIWAN LOOMS LARGE AS ANOTHER SETBACK WITH STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS. TO BE SURE CHINESE LEADERS PROBABLY ARE NOT CONCERNED BY THE PEACE PIGEON UNION WHICH SUPPORTS BIRD RACING ON THE ISLAND. THAT POLITICAL PARTY THINKS A VICTORY ON THE 16TH WILL HELP REMOVE THE TAINT SURROUNDING THE SPORT WHICH HAS BEEN CAUSED BY THE KIDNAPPING OF PIGEONS FOR RANSOM AND OTHER UNSAVORY ACTIVITY. BUT CHINA CANNOT IGNORE THE REMAINDER OF WHAT IS NOW CALLED THE THIRD FORCE A GROUP OF ACTIVISTS WHO HAVE FORMED PARTIES AND IN THE PROCESS TRANSFORMED TAIWAN POLITICS. BY NOW IT IS A FOREGONE CONCLUSION THAT THE OPPOSITION DEMOCRATIC PROGRESSIVE PARTY WILL CAPTURE THE PRESIDENCY. TSAI ING-WEN WHO FELL SHORT IN HER BID IN 2012 HAS A VIRTUALLY INSURMOUNTABLE LEAD IN A THREE-WAY RACE. SHE LED ERIC CHU THE CANDIDATE OF THE RULING KUOMINTANG BY 28.9 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE LATEST POLL BY THE CROSS-STRAIT POLICY ASSOCIATION. JAMES SOONG OF THE PEOPLE FIRST PARTY LOOKS LIKE HE IS IN THIRD PLACE A SHADE BEHIND CHU. TSAI??S DPP HAS WON THE PRESIDENCY BEFORE IN 2000 AND 2004. THE VICTOR THEN CHEN SHUI-BIAN DISAPPOINTED SUPPORTERS IN LARGE MEASURE BECAUSE THE KUOMINTANG ALSO KNOWN AS THE KMT RETAINED CONTROL OF THE LEGISLATURE AND FRUSTRATED HIS INITIATIVES. THIS TIME IT APPEARS THE KMT WHICH NOW HOLDS 65 SEATS WILL LOSE ITS COMMANDING POSITION IN THE LEGISLATIVE YUAN. GERRIT VAN DER WEES OF THE FORMOSAN ASSOCIATION FOR PUBLIC AFFAIRS NOW ON THE ISLAND TO OBSERVE THE ELECTION TELLS THE DAILY BEAST THAT PROJECTIONS SHOW THE KMT LOSING 25 OF THOSE SEATS. THE DPP THE CHALLENGER COULD CAPTURE 60 SEATS. AND THERE??S MORE BAD NEWS FOR THE KMT. THE NEW POWER PARTY FORMED LAST YEAR IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED THE ISLAND??S THIRD-MOST-POPULAR PARTY LIKELY TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN LEGISLATIVE COALITION-BUILDING AND ITS EXTRAORDINARY EMERGENCE MAKES CHINESE BOTH IN CHINA AND IN TAIWAN FEARFUL. WHY? MANY TAIWANESE ESPECIALLY THE YOUNGER GENERATION DON??T THINK THEY??RE ??CHINESE? AND THIS ETHNIC DIVIDE MIRRORS A POLITICAL SPLIT. THE THIRD FORCE GENERATION REPRESENTED BY THE NPP AND OTHER PARTIES IS PUSHING TAIWAN TOWARD ??INDEPENDENCE???RECOGNITION THE ISLAND IS NOT PART OF CHINA??FASTER AND HARDER THAN TSAI??S DPP IS WILLING TO GO AND YOUTHFUL VOTERS ARE ENGAGING IN POLITICS TO FORCE CHANGE IN THE DIRECTION THEY DEMAND. A BIT OF HISTORY: THE KMT UNDER CHIANG KAI-SHEK FLED WHAT IT CALLS ??THE MAINLAND? IN 1949 AND TRANSPLANTED TO TAIWAN THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA WITH THE CAPITAL IN TAIPEI. TO THIS DAY IT MAINTAINS TAIPEI IS THE ONLY LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT OF ??CHINA.? ON THE OTHER HAND THE COMMUNIST PARTY RULING FROM BEIJING BELIEVES TAIWAN IS THE 34TH PROVINCE OF THE PEOPLE??S REPUBLIC OF CHINA. DESPITE THE COMPETING CLAIMS THE COMMUNIST PARTY FEELS COMFORTABLE WITH THE KMT BECAUSE BOTH BELIEVE THERE IS ONLY ONE CHINA AND THAT TAIWAN IS PART OF IT. THUS IT IS NO SURPRISE THAT XI JINPING GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY AND THE KMT??S MA YING-JEOU PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA IN TAIWAN COULD MEET IN SINGAPORE IN NOVEMBER SMILE SHAKE HANDS AND TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THEIR ONE AND INDIVISIBLE COUNTRY. TSAI??S GREENS ON THE OTHER HAND BELIEVE THERE ARE TWO STATES. THEIR COUNTRY IS ??TAIWAN? NOT PART OF A GREATER CHINESE NATION. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WORRIED THAT THE NEW TAIWAN CONSCIOUSNESS WOULD ANGER BEIJING FAVORED THE KMT IN THE LAST PRESIDENTIAL CONTEST EVEN GOING SO FAR AS TO TELL THE FINANCIAL TIMES THAT IT HAD ??DISTINCT DOUBTS? TSAI WOULD BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN PEACE WITH CHINA. THIS TIME THE WHITE HOUSE IS SITTING ON THE SIDELINES BUT NONETHELESS ANXIOUS. TSAI MAY BE WILLING TO KEEP THE PEACE WITH BEIJING??SHE HAS PUBLICLY PLEDGED TO MAINTAIN THE ??STATUS QUO???BUT IT??S NOT CLEAR THE ISLAND??S YOUNG PEOPLE WANT HER TO KEEP THAT PROMISE. THE NPP EPITOMIZES THAT ATTITUDE AMID A CACOPHONOUS ARRAY OF POLITICAL VOICES IN THE LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS. THERE ARE A RECORD 18 POLITICAL PARTIES VYING FOR SEATS. THAT??S UP FROM 11 IN 2012 THE LAST ELECTION. THERE WERE 269 CANDIDATES THEN AND 354 NOW. AS CHEN CHAO-CHIEN OF MING CHUAN UNIVERSITY TOLD THE SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST ??THE NUMBER OF CONTESTANTS IN THIS PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION IS A HISTORIC HIGH.? AND SO IT SEEMS ARE THE NUMBER OF CAUSES. IN ADDITION TO AN EFFORT TO FURTHER PIGEON RACING THERE IS A CAMPAIGN DEVOTED TO SAFE SEX??A FEMALE CANDIDATE HAS BEEN HANDING OUT FREE CONDOMS??AND APPARENTLY ONE PROMOTING SEX PERIOD: ANOTHER FEMALE HOPEFUL STRIPPED DOWN TO HER RED BRA IN PUBLIC IN THE SOUTHERN PORT CITY OF KAOHSIUNG RECENTLY. THE NATIONAL POST THE TORONTO-BASED NEWSPAPER NOTES THAT ??SUPPORT FOR SMALLER OPPOSITION PARTIES IN THIS ELECTION CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN UNPRECEDENTED.? ALTHOUGH MANY OF THE YOUNG THINK THE DPP IS TOO OLD-LINE DON RODGERS OF AUSTIN COLLEGE TOLD THE DAILY BEAST THAT THE NEW WINNERS WILL PROBABLY WORK WITH TSAI AND HER PARTY WHERE IT COUNTS IN THE LEGISLATIVE YUAN. IN THE PAST THE KMT??S CONTROL OF THE LEGISLATURE MEANT IT COULD DO WHAT IT WANTED. THE RULING PARTY FOR INSTANCE RAMMED THROUGH TRADE DEALS IT HAD SIGNED WITH BEIJING DURING PRESIDENT MA??S TWO TERMS. MA THOUGHT THOSE DEALS WOULD BRING ABOUT CLOSER TIES WITH CHINA. IN FACT THOSE TRADE AGREEMENTS CREATED A BACKLASH??STUDENT GROUPS DUBBED THE SUNFLOWER MOVEMENT OCCUPIED THE LEGISLATURE FOR WEEKS IN SPRING 2014 TO STOP ONE SUCH ARRANGEMENT??AND SPURRED A GREATER SENSE OF TAIWAN IDENTITY. AS ONE AMERICAN ACADEMIC NOW IN TAIWAN WATCHING THE ELECTION TOLD THE DAILY BEAST ??FRUSTRATION WITH ECONOMIC STAGNATION AND OVER-RELIANCE ON CHINA HAS CREATED AN APPETITE FOR CHANGE IN TAIWANESE SOCIETY.? THE SENSE OF TAIWANESE IDENTITY HAS BEEN HEIGHTENED AS WELL. CHENGCHI NATIONAL UNIVERSITY RELEASED A POLL IN JUNE 2014 SHOWING THAT 60.4 PERCENT OF CITIZENS IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES AS ??TAIWANESE? VERSUS 3.5 PERCENT RESPONDING ??CHINESE? AND THE REST SAID THEY WERE BOTH. IN 1992 ONLY 17.6 PERCENT ANSWERED THEY WERE TAIWANESE. THE CHANGE IN THINKING IS SO STARK THAT THE KMT WHICH BASES ITS LEGITIMACY ON ITS CLAIM OF RULING CHINA COULD SOON DISAPPEAR. TAIWAN??S ELECTORATE IS YOUNGISH. ALMOST 40 PERCENT OF POTENTIAL VOTERS ARE UNDER 40 AND THE YOUNG ARE OVERWHELMINGLY ANTI-KMT. ONE OF THE CO-FOUNDERS OF THE NPP EVEN URGED SUPPORTERS TO ??MARGINALIZE? THE KMT AND ??MAKE IT DISAPPEAR FROM TAIWAN.? A DECEMBER POLL SHOWED THAT ONLY 11 PERCENT OF THOSE AGED 20 TO 29 SUPPORT THE KMT. AS BONNIE GLASER OF THE CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES TOLD THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ??THE MAINLAND IS QUITE FEARFUL THAT THE KMT WILL NEVER RECOVER.? IF IT SHOULD EVER FIND ITS FOOTING AGAIN THE KMT WILL DO SO AS A TAIWAN PARTY NOT A TRANSPLANTED CHINESE ONE. THIS MEANS DEMOCRATIC POLITICS WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY DRIVE TAIWAN FARTHER AWAY FROM CHINA. BEIJING HOWEVER IS NOT ABOUT TO LET UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENTS CONTINUE. CHINESE LEADERS WILL IN ALL PROBABILITY TRY TO FORCE THE NEW TAIWAN LEADER TO CONFIRM THAT THE ISLAND IS PART OF CHINA. IF THAT LEADER IS TSAI SHE WILL REFUSE. THE CHINESE AS A RESULT ARE LIKELY TO CAUSE TROUBLE OF SOME SORT BECAUSE THE COMMUNIST PARTY??S PRIMARY BASIS OF LEGITIMACY IS NATIONALISM WHICH MEANS IT MUST ??RECOVER???TAKE ACTUALLY??TAIWAN. THE ELECTION SATURDAY MEANS THERE WILL BE EVEN LESS ROOM FOR TAIPEI TO COMPROMISE. THE PEOPLE OF TAIWAN ARE NOT ABOUT TO GIVE UP THEIR FREEDOM TO PLEASE PEOPLE THEY CONSIDER FOREIGNERS. ,14347.0

IT SHOULD BE NOTED HERE THAT KANYE WAS COMPLETELY OUT OF LINE FROM THE GET-GO USING THE OCCASION OF A TERRIBLY MISINTERPRETED TWEET TO TAKE LOW BLOWS AT WIZ??S EX-WIFE AND CHILD. IF ANYONE SAID THE SAME ABOUT KARDASHIAN AND NORTH OR SAINT WEST YOU CAN REST ASSURED THAT KANYE WOULD GO FULL-BRIDE SHOWING UP AT WIZ??S HOUSE IN A FORM-FITTING YELLOW-AND-BLACK TRACKSUIT CLENCHING HATTORI HANZO STEEL. THIS ISN??T THE FIRST (OR TENTH) TIME KANYE HAS SLUT-SHAMED ROSE WHOM HE DATED FROM 2008 TO 2010 AFTER HE SPOTTED HER IN THE MUSIC VIDEO FOR LUDACRIS?? ??WHAT THEM GIRLS LIKE.? IN FEBRUARY OF LAST YEAR KANYE APPEARED ON POWER 105.1??S THE BREAKFAST CLUB ??SHE??S JUST SOAKING IN THE MOMENT? KANYE SAID OF ROSE. ??IF KIM HAD DATED ME WHEN I WANTED THERE WOULD BE NO AMBER ROSE.? HE LATER DOUBLED DOWN SAYING HE HAD TO TAKE ??30 SHOWERS? AFTER DATING ROSE BEFORE KIM WOULD ACCEPT HIM. BUT THE ORIGINS OF THIS HIP-HOP IMBROGLIO ARE HARD TO DEFINE. KANYE AND ROSE WERE VERY HOT AND HEAVY DURING THEIR THREE-YEAR RELATIONSHIP WHICH WAS IMMORTALIZED IN A VERY HOT-AND-HEAVY HEAD-LICKING PHOTO SHOOT WITH TERRY RICHARDSON. WHEN THEY SPLIT IN EARLY 2010 KANYE WENT ON A SELF-IMPOSED EXILE TO HAWAII TO WORK ON AN ALBUM DEDICATED TO ROSE MY BEAUTIFUL DARK TWISTED FANTASY. THE SONG ??RUNAWAY? IN PARTICULAR IS SEEN AS AN OPEN APOLOGY TO ROSE FOR THE WAY HE TREATED HER THROUGHOUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP. ??SHE FIND PICTURES IN MY E-MAIL / I SENT THIS BITCH A PICTURE OF MY DICK / I DON??T KNOW WHAT IT IS WITH FEMALES / BUT I??M NOT TOO GOOD WITH THAT SHIT? RAPS KANYE. ??SEE I COULD HAVE ME A GOOD GIRL / AND STILL BE ADDICTED TO THEM HOODRATS / AND I JUST BLAME EVERYTHING ON YOU / AT LEAST YOU KNOW THAT??S WHAT I??M GOOD AT.? ROSE DEALT WITH THE SPLIT A BIT DIFFERENTLY. SHE FIRST ENGAGED IN A REBOUND FLING WITH KARDASHIAN??S EX REGGIE BUSH AND THEN TOOK TO THE TABLOIDS TO AIR THE COUPLE??S DIRTY LAUNDRY CLAIMING IN A NUMBER OF INTERVIEWS THAT IT WAS KANYE??S FLIRTING WITH KIM THAT LED TO THEIR DEMISE. ??KIM IS ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WHY ME AND KANYE ARE NOT TOGETHER? ROSE SAID IN AN ??EXCLUSIVE? INTERVIEW WITH STAR MAGAZINE. ??SHE??S A HOMEWRECKER!? ACCORDING TO ROSE KANYE AND KIM WERE HOOKING UP WHILE SHE WAS STILL WITH KANYE AND KIM WAS DATING NFL RUNNING BACK REGGIE BUSH. ??THEY WERE BOTH CHEATING? SAID ROSE. ??THEY WERE BOTH CHEATING ON ME AND REGGIE WITH EACH OTHER. [KIM] WAS SENDING [RACY] PICTURES AND I WAS LIKE ??KIM JUST STOP. DON??T BE THAT PERSON.?? I THOUGHT AT LEAST SHE??D BE WOMAN ENOUGH TO RESPOND TO ME. SHE NEVER RESPONDED.? ??I WANT TO THANK HER? ROSE CONTINUED OF KIM.?Ÿ ??BECAUSE IF SHE WAS NEVER A HOMEWRECKER THEN I NEVER WOULD HAVE MET WIZ [KHALIFA] AND I WOULDN??T BE AS HAPPY AS I AM NOW.? THAT INTERVIEW TOOK PLACE IN JANUARY 2012 AND WEEKS LATER A MAN WHO CLAIMED TO BE ROSE??S FORMER PUBLICIST ALLEGED ON TWITTER AND FACEBOOK THAT HE INTRODUCED ROSE TO KANYE THAT ROSE STOLE FROM HIM AND THAT ROSE WAS PLANNING TO STEAL FROM KANYE BLAMING THE LATTER REVELATION FOR THEIR BREAK-UP??NOT KIM. ROSE DENIED THE ALLEGATIONS. KANYE AND KIM BECAME OFFICIAL IN APRIL OF THAT YEAR. FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS THE TWO HAD REACHED A GOSSIP COLUMN D??TENTE WITH KANYE AND KIM MARRYING AND HAVING TWO CHILDREN AND AMBER AND WIZ MARRYING AND HAVING ONE CHILD. FOLLOWING ROSE AND WIZ??S SPLIT IN LATE 2014 HER BEEF WITH KANYE REIGNITED. IN FEBRUARY 2015 KIM??S LITTLE SISTER KYLIE JENNER (17) BEGAN DATING THE RAPPER TYGA (25). NOW TYGA HAS A CHILD WITH THE HIP-HOP MODEL BLAC CHYNA WHO IS BEST FRIENDS WITH ROSE. WHEN THE RELATIONSHIP CAME TO LIGHT ROSE WENT ON THE BREAKFAST CLUB AND BLASTED IT. ??KYLIE??S A BABY? SAID ROSE. ??SHE NEEDS TO GO TO BED AT 7 O??CLOCK AND RELAX. IT??S RIDICULOUS. TYGA SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF HIMSELF. THAT??S HOW I FEEL FOR SURE. HE HAS A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN AND A BABY THAT HE LEFT FOR A 16-YEAR-OLD WHO JUST TURNED 17.? ROSE DID MAKE SOME GOOD POINTS??IN THEIR HOME STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE KYLIE/TYGA COUPLING QUALIFIES AS STATUTORY RAPE. THE INTERVIEW PROMPTED KYLIE??S SISTER KHLOE KARDASHIAN TO FIRE OFF A FEW TWEETS AT ROSE LABELING HER A HYPOCRITE FOR STRIPPING AT 15 YET CRITICIZING KYLIE FOR HER ILLICIT RELATIONSHIP WITH TYGA. ROSE DIDN??T TAKE THE CRITICISM LYING DOWN AND DECIDED TO DRAG KIM??AND BY EXTENSION KANYE??INTO THE MIX: KANYE??S INFAMOUS ??30 SHOWERS? INTERVIEW ON THE BREAKFAST CLUB WAS IN RESPONSE TO THIS TWEET BY ROSE. AND IF THAT WEREN??T ENOUGH IN RECENT WEEKS ROSE??S PAL (AND TYGA??S EX) BLAC CHYNA HAS BEGAN DATING ROB KARDASHIAN THE SEMI-ESTRANGED BROTHER OF KYLIE KIM KHLOE AND CO. IT??S HARD TO DETERMINE WHO??S MORE AT FAULT HERE. IF KANYE CHEATED ON HER ROSE HAS A RIGHT TO BE UPSET. BUT IT??S BEEN SIX YEARS SINCE THEY??VE SPLIT. THE TWO HAVE BOTH MOVED ON AND STARTED SEPARATE FAMILIES YET ROSE WHO IS MOSTLY FAMOUS DUE TO HER ASSOCIATION WITH KANYE SEEMS TO KEEP TETHERING HERSELF TO KANYE AND THE KARDASHIANS FOR THE CONSIDERABLE INK IT GENERATES. AND THE SAME GOES FOR BLAC CHYNA TYGA AND THE KARDASHIANS. THE BEST THING KANYE CAN DO IS IGNORE THEM ENTIRELY BUT HE'S NEVER BEEN ONE TO TAKE AN INSULT LYING DOWN. WHEN ROSE CAUGHT WIND OF THE RECENT KANYE-WIZ SPAT AND THE INSULTS HE THREW HER WAY SHE WENT FOR THE JUGULAR: AS LONG AS THERE??S INK TO BE SPILLED AND GOSSIP COLUMNS TO BE FILLED DON??T EXPECT THIS FEUD TO DIE DOWN ANYTIME SOON. ROSE??S CELEBRITY DEPENDS ON IT. ,91443.0
1233,10322325.0,2016-01-27T05:01:00+00:00,JOE BIDEN HAS ALREADY STARTED THE WAR ON CANCER,A MOON SHOT TO CURE CANCER MIGHT SEEM AN IMPOSSIBLE DREAM EVEN FOR A GENERATION SHAPED BY JFK??S VISION. YET THAT IS THE METAPHOR THAT VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN IS EMBRACING AS HE PUTS THE PIECES IN PLACE TO CARRY OUT THE MISSION GIVEN HIM BY THE PRESIDENT FOR THEIR FINAL YEAR IN OFFICE. THERE COULDN??T BE A MORE WELCOME ASSIGNMENT FOR BIDEN THE FATHER WHO LOST HIS 46-YEAR-OLD SON TO BRAIN CANCER LAST YEAR AND FOR BIDEN THE PUBLIC SERVANT WHO LAMENTED WHEN HE WITHDREW FROM THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE THAT HE HAD HOPED TO BE THE PRESIDENT WHO CURED CANCER. IN THE RUN-UP TO THAT DECISION BIDEN??S FRIEND AND LONGTIME AIDE FORMER SENATOR TED KAUFMAN ASKED HIM THIS CORE QUESTION: WHAT IS IT YOU WOULD WANT TO DO AS PRESIDENT? ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT CAME UP WAS CANCER. KAUFMAN TOLD THE DAILY BEAST THAT WHEN BEAU BIDEN WAS FIRST DIAGNOSED IN 2013 THE VICE PRESIDENT REACTED ??LIKE ANY PARENT WAS OBSESSED WITH TRYING TO HELP HIS SON THROUGH THIS. HE TALKED TO DOZENS OF PEOPLE ANYBODY WHO COULD HELP?? AND OVER THAT PERIOD HE ACCUMULATED A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE PRESENT STATE OF PLAY AROUND CANCER IN THIS COUNTRY.? BIDEN SAYS A CANCER MOON SHOT IS MUCH BIGGER THAN HIS SON BUT WHERE BEAU??S ILLNESS WAS THE DRIVING FORCE IT WAS ALL THAT TIME SPENT WITH DOCTORS THEIR ASSURANCES OF HOPE THEIR CONFIDENCE THAT BETTER TREATMENTS WERE ON THE HORIZON THAT INFLUENCED BIDEN. ??IN CONSTANT MEETINGS WITH DOCTORS HE SAW THE MUCH BIGGER SCOPE OF WHAT COULD BE DONE? KAUFMAN SAYS. ??HE REALLY FELT IF BEAU LIVES ANOTHER SIX MONTHS EVEN THAT HE FELT THINGS COULD BE BETTER??MONTHS NOT YEARS.? THIS HOLDING OUT OF HOPE PERHAPS FALSE HOPE IS FAMILIAR TO ANYONE WHO HAS NAVIGATED THE WORLD OF CANCER. THE LATE STEVE JOBS TALKED OF ??MAKING IT TO THE NEXT LILY PAD? IN HIS EFFORT TO OUTDISTANCE THE DISEASE. MY LATE HUSBAND FOUGHT METASTATIC KIDNEY CANCER FOR ALMOST FIVE YEARS?ŸBEFORE IT SPREAD TO HIS BRAIN AND KILLED HIM. THE CLINICAL TRIALS HE TOOK PART IN SHOWED PROMISE BASED ON ANIMAL TESTING AND HE MARVELED AT THE MANY MICE OUT THERE WHO WERE CURED HUMANS NOT SO MUCH. TOM DIED ALMOST ELEVEN YEARS AGO AND HE WAS ON THE CUTTING EDGE THEN OF IMMUNOTHERAPY. HE CALLED IT ??SHAKE AND BAKE? BECAUSE THE DRUGS THAT MARSHALED HIS IMMUNE SYSTEM TO FIGHT THE CANCER CAUSED FLU-LIKE SYMPTOMS WITH BONE-RACKING CHILLS AND THEN FEVERS AS HIGH AS 105 DEGREES. HE OFTEN SAID THE TREATMENT FELT WORSE THAN THE DISEASE. A LOT OF PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN THIS AREA EVEN IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND BIDEN SAYS HE??S LOOKING FOR ??QUANTUM LEAPS.? HE BELIEVES WE??RE ON THE PRECIPICE OF REAL BREAKTHROUGHS IN IMMUNOTHERAPY AND GENOMICS THAT WILL TAKE CANCER TREATMENT FAR BEYOND THE BLUNT INSTRUMENTS OF CHEMOTHERAPY AND RADIATION THERAPY. AT DAVOS LAST WEEK BIDEN MET WITH CANCER EXPERTS FROM AROUND THE WORLD AND SAID ??OUR GOAL IS TO MAKE A DECADE??S WORTH OF ADVANCES?ŸIN FIVE YEARS?ŸINSTEAD OF 10 AND EVENTUALLY END CANCER AS WE KNOW IT. WE??RE NOT LOOKING FOR INCREMENTAL CHANGES. I??M LOOKING FOR QUANTUM LEAPS.? NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH DIRECTOR FRANCIS COLLINS WHO CREDITS BIDEN WITH WORKING WITH CONGRESS TO INCREASE THE NIH BUDGET TO THE HIGHEST IT??S BEEN IN A DECADE CALLED THE VICE PRESIDENT ??DELIGHTFULLY UNPLUGGED? AS HE MADE HIS CANCER MOON SHOT CENTER STAGE AT THE DAVOS GATHERING OF GLOBAL LEADERS. IN THE WEEKS SINCE PRESIDENT OBAMA TAPPED HIM TO LEAD THIS NEW CANCER INITIATIVE BIDEN HAS MET WITH ALL THE MAJOR CANCER GROUPS SOME TWO DOZEN AND 200 INDIVIDUALS THAT KAUFMAN DESCRIBES AS A ??WHO??S WHO IN CANCER.? A FORMAL ??PRESIDENTIAL MEMORANDUM? WITH KENNEDY-ERA MOON SHOT LANGUAGE WILL ESTABLISH A TASK FORCE OF FEDERAL AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS FROM THE NIH TO THE PENTAGON AND ONCE THAT IS COMPLETE BIDEN WILL CONVENE A MEETING AT THE WHITE HOUSE TO ESTABLISH AN AGENDA FOR THE YEAR AHEAD ??AND THE MEASURABLES? SAYS PRESS SECRETARY MEGHAN DUBYAK. AT A ROUNDTABLE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA CANCER CENTER BIDEN SAID HE DOESN??T WANT ANYONE TO THINK HE??S ??NA??VE? IN SETTING SUCH A SWEEPING GOAL AS CURING CANCER. HE KNOWS IT CAN??T BE DONE OVERNIGHT BUT HE INSISTS THAT TREMENDOUS LEAPS CAN BE MADE BY MARSHALING THE RESOURCES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND LEVERAGING WHAT??S ALREADY HAPPENING IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. I FOR ONE WOULDN??T BET AGAINST HIM. CANCER RESEARCH HAS NEVER HAD A CHEERLEADER AS HIGH-PROFILE AND AS COMMITTED AS BIDEN. IT WASN??T THAT LONG AGO THAT HIV-AIDS WAS A DEATH SENTENCE. CAN THE SAME GREAT LEAP FORWARD OCCUR FOR CANCER? A LOT OF SMART PEOPLE ARE SAYING IT COULD. FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS THE POLITICS ARE IRRELEVANT. EVERYONE WISHES BIDEN WELL. THERE ARE NO HIDDEN AGENDAS. ??WHAT HE??S DOING IS PRIMARILY TO HONOR HIS SON BUT ALSO TO DO SOMETHING TRULY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THE NEXT BEAU DOESN??T HAVE TO DIE PREMATURELY? SAYS JONAH BLANK WHO WORKED FOR BIDEN ON HIS SENATE STAFF AND IS NOW WITH THE RAND CORPORATION. ??WILL IT HAPPEN IN THE NEXT YEAR? PROBABLY NOT. THE NEXT FIVE OR 10? MAYBE AS A LONGSHOT. BUT BIDEN MIGHT WELL HAVE ANOTHER 20 YEARS OF CIVIC CONTRIBUTIONS AND WOULDN??T THAT BE A GREAT LEGACY?? AS A SOCIETY WE PAY MORE ATTENTION TO FORMER PRESIDENTS THAN FORMER VICE PRESIDENTS BUT THAT WON??T DETER BIDEN. ??I PLAN ON DOING THIS THE REST OF MY LIFE? HE ENTHUSED WHEN TALKING TO CANCER RESEARCHERS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA??S CANCER CENTER. AND WHEN THE BREAKTHROUGH HAPPENS THE HEADLINE WILL WRITE ITSELF: ??BIG F---ING DEAL.? ,6767.0
1257,10341847.0,2016-01-27T18:26:00+00:00,INSIDE THE UPRISING AGAINST MOLDOVA??S DONALD TRUMP,CHISINAU MOLDOVA ?? EUROPE??S POOREST COUNTRY MOLDOVA HAS ONE VERY RICH PROBLEM. EVERYBODY YOU TALK TO FROM A TAXI DRIVER TO THE SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT TO A HIPSTER AT A COFFEE SHOP SAYS THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS CONTROLLED BY ONE SHADOWY MAN THE WIDELY WILDLY HATED VLAD PLAHOTNIUC. (NICKNAME: PLAHA ?? THE SCAFFOLD) HE IS MOLDOVA??S DONALD TRUMP CHISINAU??S BERLUSCONI??A BILLIONAIRE WITH BIG APPETITES FOR POWER MONEY AND WOMEN AND NO SENSE OF LIMITS. PLAHOTNIUC OWNS FOUR NATIONAL TELEVISION AND THREE RADIO STATIONS PRIVATE SECURITY FORCES LUXURIOUS HOTELS. NOBODY KNOWS EXACTLY HOW MUCH HE IS WORTH. MEANWHILE HE LEADS THE MOLDOVAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY ALTHOUGH HIS OFFICIAL STATUS IS VICE CHAIR. HE LIKES TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE HIS FRONT MEN. LIKE TRUMP OR BERLUSCONI PLAHOTNIUC SEEMS TO HAVE NO SENSE OF LIMITS OR DECENCY. WHEN ONE OF THE COUNTRY??S LEADING TELEVISION JOURNALISTS (THE MEGYN KELLY OF MOLDOVA ONE MIGHT STAY) SHE GOT A CALL WARNING HER HE WAS ABOUT TO RELEASE A SEX TAPE OF HER AND HER LOVER FILMED INSIDE HER APARTMENT. WASHINGTON AND EUROPE PLAYING AT REALPOLITIK IGNORE THE POLITICAL REALITIES HERE MAKING DEALS WITH PLAHOTNIUC??S PAWNS IN MOLDOVA??S PARLIAMENT WHO PRESENT THEMSELVES AS PRO-EUROPE PRO-WEST AND ANTI-RUSSIAN. THE RESULT IS A DEEP SENSE OF HOPELESSNESS AND FRUSTRATION AMONG THOSE ON THE GROUND ACTUALLY WORKING TO BUILD CIVIL SOCIETY. LAST WEEK A NEW GOVERNMENT WAS FORMED WHEN 58 DEPUTIES VOTED FOR IT IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT. ON MONDAY MOLDOVA??S PARLIAMENT SPEAKER ANDRIAN CANDU ADMITTED IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE DAILY BEAST THAT PLAHOTNIUC HAD ??PROVIDED THE MAJORITY.? IT WAS A DIRTY SHAMEFUL FIGHT AND IN THE AFTERMATH ONE OF MOST POPULAR TELEVISION NEWS PROGRAMS ??POLITICS? TRIED TO INVITE PLAHOTNIUC TO APPEAR AND TO OFFER HIS EXPLANATIONS ABOUT THE VOTE. WHEN THERE WAS NO RESPONSE THE SHOW??S ANCHOR NATALIA MORARI ONE OF MOLDOVA??S MOST CELEBRATED TV JOURNALISTS WROTE AN OPEN LETTER TO THE OLIGARCH AND PUBLISHED IT ON SOCIAL NETWORKS. ??YOU WILL NEVER BECOME THE ONE YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO BE??THE LEGITIMATE LEADER OF MOLDOVA. IN THE SHADOWS??YES. SURREPTITIOUSLY??YES. BUT NEVER LEGITIMATELY? MORARI WROTE. RETALIATION CAME THE SAME DAY. MORARI RECEIVED A PHONE CALL FROM ONE OF?Ÿ PLAHOTNIUC??S ASSOCIATES WHOM SHE KNEW WELL. ??THEY TOLD ME TO BE PREPARED SINCE VERY SOON THEY WILL RELEASE A ??HORRIBLY SCARY?? VIDEO OF ME HAVING SEX WITH MY LOVER THAT THEY HAVE SECRETLY RECORDED IN MY BEDROOM SEVERAL YEARS AGO? MORARI TOLD THE DAILY BEAST IN AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW. ??THAT SEEMS TO BE PLAHOTNIUC??S FAVORITE STYLE TO DISCREDIT PEOPLE? SAID MORARI. ??WE INTERVIEWED OFFICIALS WHO TOLD US THAT IN THE 1990S HE OWNED A SAUNA WHERE HE PROVIDED BUSINESSMEN AND EVEN DIPLOMATS WITH YOUNG PROSTITUTES PLAHOTNIUC KEPT A COLLECTION OF VIDEOS TO BLACKMAIL PEOPLE AND PUSH THEM TO CERTAIN DEALS.? THIS IS THE REGIME THEN PUBLICLY SUPPORTED BY VICTORIA NULAND U.S. ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE VICTORIA NULAND LAST WEEK WHEN SHE CALLED A ??PRO-EUROPEAN GOVERNMENT.? IN MOLDOVA IN FACT AMERICA MUST CHOOSE BETWEEN PUSHING FOR DEMOCRATIC VALUES OR PUSHING BACK AGAINST RUSSIA. ON TUESDAY THE U.S. EUROPEAN COMMAND ISSUED AN ??UPDATED THEATER STRATEGY? DOCUMENT HIGHLIGHTING RUSSIAN AGGRESSION AS A TOP CONCERN. ??RUSSIA IS PRESENTING ENDURING CHALLENGES TO OUR ALLIES AND PARTNERS IN MULTIPLE REGIONS THEREFORE IT IS A GLOBAL CHALLENGE THAT REQUIRES A GLOBAL RESPONSE? THE REPORT SAID. APPARENTLY WASHINGTON WANTS MOLDOVA TO FIT INTO THAT STRATEGY. IN REACTION ON WEDNESDAY PRO-KREMLIN ACTIVISTS PUT OUT A BANNER ON A BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE U.S. EMBASSY WITH A CARICATURE OF U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA BRANDED AS A ??KILLER.? IN MOLDOVA ORDINARY PEOPLE AREN??T THINKING ABOUT GEOPOLITICS THEY ARE TRYING TO SURVIVE ON AN AVERAGE SALARIES OF LESS THAN $200 A MONTH IN A COUNTRY WHERE OFFICIALS ROB THEM AGAIN AND AGAIN. SO INCREASINGLY THEY ARE TAKING TO THE STREETS. ON SUNDAY MORE THAN 15000 MOLDAVANS SOME WITH PRO-WESTERN AND SOME WITH PRO-RUSSIAN POLITICAL VIEWS JOINED AN OPPOSITION RALLY IN FRONT OF THE GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS HERE IN THE CAPITAL. PROTESTERS WERE PARTICULARLY ANGRY ABOUT THE RUSHED APPOINTMENT OF PAVEL FILIP PLAHOTNIUC??S LONG TIME ASSOCIATE AS PRIME MINISTER. THE REORGANIZATION TOOK PLACE ABOUT TWO MONTHS BEFORE THE CURRENT PRESIDENT??S MANDATE IS SET TO EXPIRE SO THE NEW GOVERNMENT GETS TO SCHEDULE THE NEXT NATIONAL ELECTIONS. ??THE CABINET WAS APPOINTED WITHOUT DEBATES? SAID VLADIMIR SOLOVIEV EDITOR-IN-CHIEF OF NEWSMAKER AN INDEPENDENT MOLDAVAN ONLINE PUBLICATION SUPPORTED BY WESTERN GRANT MONEY. WIDELY BELIEVED STORIES CIRCULATED AND WERE REPEATED TO THE DAILY BEAST BY PARLIAMENTARY OFFICIALS AND INVESTIGATIVE REPORTERS TO THE EFFECT THAT BRIBES FROM $200000 TO UP TO $2 MILLION WERE OFFERED TO DEPUTIES FROM OPPOSITION PARTIES TO GET THEM TO VOTE FOR THE COALITION. THE PROTESTORS THE NIGHT OF THE VOTE WERE IN A FEROCIOUS MOOD. ??DEPUTIES CHANGED INTO POLICE UNIFORMS AND ESCAPED THE PARLIAMENT SO THE CROWDS OUTSIDE WOULD NOT TEAR THEM APART? SAID SOLOVIEV. ??NO EUROPEAN COUNTRY WOULD EVER ALLOW SUCH A SHAMEFUL APPOINTMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT.? THE NEW CABINET WAS ESTABLISHED BY MIDNIGHT THURSDAY IN A GREAT HURRY. ??BUT THE U.S. POSITION HAD BEEN ALREADY ANNOUNCED AND NOW THE COUNTRY ASSOCIATES NULAND??S WORDS WITH THIS SITUATION.? WAS NULAND AWARE OF THE ANTI-DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES TAKING PLACE IN THE COUNTRY? DID SHE KNOW OF THE SHADY REPUTATION OF PLAHOTNIUC? ONE KNOWLEDGEABLE MOLDOVAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL SPEAKING ON BACKGROUND TO THE DAILY BEAST SAID THAT AS LONG AGO AS LAST JUNE NULAND DELIVERED WASHINGTON??S GUIDELINES TO PLAHOTNIUC: PROVIDE US WITH THE PRO-WESTERN MAJORITY AND WITHDRAW YOURSELF FROM THE PARLIAMENT. SO THE DEAL IS DONE AND THE OLIGARCH LIKE A PUPPET MASTER STAYS BEHIND A CURTAIN. PARLIAMENT SPEAKER CANDU TOLD THE DAILY BEAST ON MONDAY THAT MOLDOVA??S LEADERSHIP COULD NOT AFFORD EARLY ELECTIONS THAT CARRIED WITH THEM THE RISK OF LOSING POWER TO PRO-RUSSIAN POLITICAL PARTIES. SO THE ELECTIONS HAVE NOT BEEN SCHEDULED YET. IN THE EARLY ??90S MOLDOVA LOST A PART OF ITS TERRITORY??THE PRO-RUSSIAN TRANSNISTRIA REGION??AND DURING THE LAST TWO DECADES HAS BUILT MILITARY BASES OCCUPIED BY SOME 2000 TROOPS ON THE BORDER OF THE UNRECOGNIZED REPUBLIC. SINCE THE CRIMEAN CRISES TWO YEARS AGO MOLDOVA??S AUTHORITIES HAVE LIVED IN FEAR THAT PRO-RUSSIAN MILITIA MIGHT ATTACK FROM THE BREAKAWAY TRANSNISTRIA AND THAT RUSSIA MIGHT TRY TO ANNEX THE SEPARATIST REGION WHICH ALSO BORDERS UKRAINE. DURING THE FEW MONTHS LEFT BEFORE THE ELECTIONS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN SOMETIME THIS YEAR THE NEW GOVERNMENT HAS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IT CAN PERFORM OFFICIALS TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. TO DO THAT IT MUST PUBLISH AN INVESTIGATIVE REPORT ABOUT THE STOLEN MONEY ESTABLISH A NATIONAL ANTI-CORRUPTION INSTITUTION FIND LOANS IN THE WEST TO SLOW DOWN THE ECONOMIC CRISES AND MAYBE EVEN PROSECUTE AT LEAST ONE CORRUPT OLIGARCH. OTHERWISE ??IF WE DO NOT SUCCEED? CANDU TOLD US MOLDOVA WOULD FAIL NULAND??S EXPECTATIONS. AS WASHINGTON??S EMISSARY IN POST-SOVIET COUNTRIES NULAND HAS PLAYED THE ROLE OF TOUGH FIXER AND AN ENFORCER OF PRO-U.S. INTERESTS. DURING THE PRO-WESTERN ??REVOLUTION OF DIGNITY? IN UKRAINE FOR EXAMPLE SHE BECAME FAMOUS FOR PLAYING THE ROLE OF FAIRY QUEEN AND HANDING OUT COOKIES TO PROTESTERS. SHE IS ALSO REMEMBERED FOR HER STRONG ??FUCK THE EU? COMMENT IN A LEAKED PHONE CONVERSATION WITH GEOFFREY PYATT U.S. AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE IN 2014. AFTER SUGGESTING THAT ??YATS? CURRENT PRIME MINISTER ARSENIY YATSENYUK WOULD BE THE BEST MAN TO LEAD THE NEW UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT NULAND CONCLUDED ??SO THAT WOULD BE GREAT I THINK TO HELP GLUE THIS THING AND TO HAVE THE U.N. HELP GLUE IT AND YOU KNOW FUCK THE E.U? WHICH SHE APPARENTLY FELT HAD BEEN EQUIVOCAL IN ITS SUPPORT FOR THE UPRISING. THERE??S NO DOUBT POLITICS IS A ROUGH GAME IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD. THE POPULAR MOLDOVAN POLITICIAN RENATO USATY TOLD US THAT YES HE HAS A HOUSE AND A BUSINESS IN RUSSIA AS WELL AS ??CONNECTIONS AND FRIENDSHIPS AT ALL LEVELS FROM MANAGERS OF RUSSIAN OIL COMPANIES TO THE FSB [SECRET SERVICE] OR POLICE OFFICERS.? AND USATY SEES PLAHOTNIUC AS HIS PERSONAL ENEMY: ??I AM CONCERNED THAT MY LIFE IS UNDER THREAT? SAID THE PRO-RUSSIAN POLITICIAN. LAST WEEK AUTHORITIES BANNED SEVERAL JOURNALISTS FROM ENTERING THE COUNTRY AND COVERING THE EVENTS. ON THURSDAY ANGRY CROWDS BROKE INTO THE PARLIAMENT SHORTLY AFTER THE LAWMAKERS VOTED FOR THE NEW CABINET DEMANDING EARLY ELECTIONS. THE VOTE NOW COULD BE A PROBLEM FOR THE WEST AS PRO-RUSSIAN PARTIES GROW MORE AND MORE POPULAR IN MOLDOVA AND WHERE DEMOCRACY WAS A VICTIM OF THE GEOPOLITICAL GAME. TWO OF THE OPPOSITION??S PARTY LEADERS USATY AND IGOR DODON ARE SUPPORTERS OF MOLDOVA JOINING THE RUSSIAN-LED CUSTOMS UNION OF EX-SOVIET STATES. THE GREATEST AFFLICTION AND RISK TO WESTERN DEMOCRATIC VALUES IN THE ARC OF FORMER SOVIET COUNTRIES FROM MOLDOVA TO LATVIA IS CORRUPTION WHICH COULD CAUSE THE LOCAL ELITE TO TURN TO RUSSIA. ?Ÿ??MOLDOVA IS TRAPPED? SAYS MAYA SANDU A HARVARD-EDUCATED REFORMIST POLITICIAN ??AND THIS COUNTRY IS IN DANGER. WE NEED TO BUILD DEMOCRACY FROM SCRATCH.? THE PROBLEM SANDU INSISTS IS THAT THE CURRENT WESTERN-BACKED GOVERNMENT IS IN FACT FAR FROM BEING PRO-EUROPEAN. AS MOLDAVA??S MINISTER OF EDUCATION FROM 2012 TO 2014 SHE SAYS SHE SAW CORRUPTION AND UNPROFESSIONALISM IN THE GOVERNMENT WITH HER OWN EYES. ??EVERYBODY IS TIRED OF THE OLIGARCHS? SHE SAYS. ??IF I HAD A CHANCE TO TALK WITH PLAHOTNIUC I WOULD TELL HIM TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY.? ,8997.0

JUST A FEW WEEKS AFTER DITCHING THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE LINDSEY GRAHAM TRIED TO SHAKE IT UP FRIDAY BY SNUBBING A CLOSE SENATE COLLEAGUE. THE SOUTH CAROLINA SENATOR AND SUNDAY SHOW PERMA-GUEST ENDORSED JEB BUSH THIS FRIDAY MORNING POPPING INTO A MEETING ROOM IN A NORTH CHARLESTON DOUBLETREE HOTEL TO PRAISE THE FORMER FLORIDA GOVERNOR. AND SINCE NO BUSH EVENT WOULD BE COMPLETE WITHOUT A DISCUSSION OF MARCO RUBIO THE GOVERNOR??S RIVAL CAME UP THROUGHOUT. BUSH HAS DONE LITTLE TO HIDE HIS DISAPPROVAL OF RUBIO??S PRESIDENTIAL POLITICKING BUT GRAHAM??S DECISION TO GET ON BOARD WITH THE MARCO-BASHING SURPRISED SOME. AFTER ALL RUBIO AND GRAHAM ARE CUT FROM IDENTICAL IDEOLOGICAL CLOTH WHEN IT COMES TO FOREIGN POLICY AND GRAHAM JOINED WITH RUBIO IN 2013 TO PUSH FOR COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM. SO WHY DID GRAHAM OPT FOR A LOW-POLLING FORMER GOVERNOR SADDLED WITH A PROBLEMATIC LAST NAME INSTEAD OF TEAMING UP AGAIN WITH HIS SENATE ALLY? THERE ARE A HOST OF INTERESTING THEORIES BUT IMMIGRATION WAS THE MOST PROMINENT ISSUE AT THE PRESS EVENT WHERE GRAHAM ANNOUNCED THE ENDORSEMENT. FLANKED BY OTHER SUPPORTERS AND ADDRESSING NATIONAL MEDIA BUSH CHARGED THAT RUBIO??S ABANDONMENT OF HIS IMMIGRATION REFORM EFFORTS??THE FLORIDA SENATOR DECIDED TO OPPOSE HIS OWN BILL A FEW MONTHS AFTER IT PASSED??REFLECTED POORLY ON HIS CHARACTER. ??MARCO CUT AND RUN PLAIN AND SIMPLE FOR WHATEVER REASON? THE FORMER GOVERNOR SAID. ??THERE MAY BE LEGITIMATE REASONS BUT HE CUT AND RUN. HE ASKED FOR MY SUPPORT ON A BILL AND HE CUT AND RUN. HE CUT AND RUN ON HIS COLLEAGUES AS WELL.? GRAHAM OF COURSE WAS ONE OF THOSE COLLEAGUES. AND WHEN REPORTERS PRESSED HIM ON THE ISSUE HE DIDN??T HAVE KIND WORDS FOR HIS ERSTWHILE ALLY. ??I??M NOT HERE TO TALK ABOUT MARCO RUBIO??S COMMITMENT TO IMMIGRATION REFORM? HE SAID. ??I??VE SEEN JEB HAS BEEN CONSISTENT. ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT I WORKED HARD TO PASS A BILL. YOU CAN ALWAYS MAKE THE BILL BETTER. I NEVER CUT AND RUN.? GRAHAM ALLIES SPEAKING ANONYMOUSLY BECAUSE GRAHAM DIDN??T AUTHORIZE THEM TO TALK ARGUED THAT THE SOUTH CAROLINIAN SUSTAINED MORE POLITICAL INJURY BECAUSE OF HIS CONSISTENT IMMIGRATION STANCE AND RUBIO HUNG HIM OUT TO DRY. THEY SAY FLORIDA??S GROWING HISPANIC POPULATION MEANS RUBIO COULD HAVE STAYED THE IMMIGRATION-REFORM COURSE WITHOUT SERIOUSLY JEOPARDIZING HIS POLITICAL FUTURE. GRAHAM MEANWHILE WON THE ??LINDSEY GRAHAMNESTY? NICKNAME FROM RUSH LIMBAUGH BECAUSE OF HIS WORK ON THE ISSUE AND FACED TWO TRICKY PRIMARY ELECTIONS BECAUSE OF HIS PRO-REFORM STANCE. IN THEIR VIEW RUBIO??S REPUDIATION OF HIS OWN BILL??FOUR MONTHS AFTER HE VOTED FOR IT??DIDN??T EXACTLY MAKE HIM A PROFILE IN COURAGE.

ACCORDING TO FANNY COSANDEY A FRENCH HISTORIAN AND A PROFESSOR AT THE SCHOOL FOR ADVANCED STUDIES IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES IN PARIS WHILE THE COUNT AND THE QUEEN MAY HAVE SHARED A LOVE STORY IT LIKELY ONLY UNFOLDED ON THE PAGE NOT IN THE BEDROOM. \""PERSONALLY I DON'T THINK IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR QUEEN MARIE ANTOINETTE TO HAVE HAD AN ACTUAL PHYSICAL RELATIONSHIP WITH FERSEN\"" COSANDEY TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. \""MAYBE IT WAS A PLATONIC LOVE MAYBE IT WAS A STRONGER RELATIONSHIP??

1400,10430388.0,2016-01-30T05:01:00+00:00,THE DOG CANCER AND ME: BETTER THAN YESTERDAY,THE OLD DOG IS DYING IT??S HARD TO SAY IF HE KNOWS. HE LIES ON THE FLOOR IN FRONT OF THE GLASS DOOR IN THE OUTBUILDING WHERE I WORK TOO SPENT TO CLIMB UP ONTO THE LEATHER CHAIR WHERE FOR 10 YEARS OR SO HE HAS DROWSED WHILE I PECK AWAY AT THE KEYS. IT??S RAINING OUTSIDE AND A DEER WALKS PAST NOT 20 FEET AWAY AND THE DOG LIFTS HIS EYEBROWS ENOUGH TO CAUSE HIS FOREHEAD TO WRINKLE INTO FURROWS AND THEN DROPS HIS CHIN BACK ONTO HIS PAWS AND GOES BACK TO WHEREVER HE WAS. IT??S STRANGE TO IMAGINE BUT INSIDE HIM THERE IS A STORM. THE SPEED OF IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE. THREE WEEKS AGO??A DAY OR TWO MORE NOW??HE WAKES ME UP IN THE NIGHT PANTING. WE HEAD INTO THE KITCHEN AND I OFFER HIM SOME FRESH WATER. HE TURNS IT DOWN AND STANDS BY THE DOOR AND AFTER I LET HIM OUT HE DRINKS RAINWATER FROM MRS. DEXTER??S FLOWERPOTS. THEN HE LIES DOWN ON THE PORCH FOR HALF AN HOUR COOLING OFF AND I SIT BY THE DOOR READING AND AT 2:30 OR SO HE COMES BACK IN. THREE HOURS PREVIOUS BACK BEFORE THE FIRST TIME WE WENT TO BED I??D CLEANED THE GOOP THAT RUNS OUT OF THE INSIDE CORNERS OF HIS EYES AS I DO EVERY NIGHT. THAT WAS MIDNIGHT. AT 3 A.M. THE STUFF IS BACK TWO INCHES LONG AND DARKER THAN BEFORE. HE IS A PALE LAB ALMOST WHITE AND IN THE DIM LIGHT THE STAINS ARE THERE AGAIN RUNNING FROM THE CORNERS OF HIS EYES??WHICH ARE ALMOST BLACK??AND TOGETHER WITH THE LINES OF GOOP LOOK LIKE OLD-FASHIONED KEYHOLES. HE TAKES A SHOT AT GETTING UP ON THE BED AND MISSES SCRAMBLING AT THE EDGE OF THE MATTRESS LOOKING FOR SOME PURCHASE FOR HIS HIND FEET AND THEN DROPS HARD BACK ONTO THE FLOOR. I PILE PILLOWS BESIDE THE BED AND COVER THEM WITH A SHEET AND IN THE FIVE OR 10 SECONDS BEFORE I AM BACK IN BED MYSELF HE IS SNORING. IN THE MORNING HE TURNS DOWN BREAKFAST. IT TAKES A MINUTE FOR THIS NEWS TO SETTLE: HENRY IS TURNING DOWN FOOD. THIS IS EXACTLY AS LIKELY AS FINDING HIM DOWN BY THE RIVER PLAYING A HARMONICA. *** FRIDAY AFTERNOON DR. PARENT TAKES THE DOG??S VITAL SIGNS AS THEY SAY AND THEN PULLS SOME BLOOD FOR TESTS AND THEN EXAMINES THE ENTIRE CREATURE RUNNING HIS HANDS UP AND DOWN HIS COAT. THE DOG PANTS AND LICKS AT A FEW DROPS OF SPILLED WATER ON THE EXAMINATION TABLE. DR. PARENT DOES NOT LIKE WHAT HE IS FEELING AND ALL THERE IS TO SAY ABOUT THE NEXT 10 MINUTES??IF THERE IS SOMETHING MORE TO THIS STORY THAN THE END OF A DOG??IT IS THAT WHAT YOU DO WHEN THERE??S NOTHING YOU CAN DO CAN MATTER FOR A LONG TIME. HENRY CONTINUES NOT TO EAT. I STIR-FRY CHICKEN HE CAN??T STOMACH THE SMELL. IN THE MORNING??IT??S SATURDAY NOW??I FRY A REDUCED-FOR-QUICK-SALE 28-OUNCE BONELESS RIB-EYE STEAK RARE. ENOUGH MEAT ON THAT PLATE TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT AND HE TURNS AWAY. A COUPLE OF HOURS LATER I TRY A 3-OUNCE FANCY FEAST CHICKEN HEARTS & LIVER FEAST IN GRAVY SLICED GOURMET CAT FOOD WHICH COMES OUT OF THE CAN WHOLE QUIVERING LIKE JELL-O AND WHICH THE ANIMAL HAS IN THE PAST SWALLOWED IN ITS ENTIRETY WHILE I HAVE TURNED AWAY FOR THE HALF SECOND IT TAKES TO CALL THE CAT. BUT NOT THIS TIME. THIS TIME HE CAN??T EAT AND I KNOW ABOUT THAT. *** ODDLY ENOUGH WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS BEFORE HENRY AND I. EXCEPT LAST TIME I WAS THE ONE WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO DIE. I??D BEEN BITTEN BY A DOG??NOT HENRY BY THE WAY??A PUPPY WHO GOT EXCITED WHILE WE WERE PLAYING??AND THE INFECTION SETTLED IN MY SPINE FIRST AND THEN SPREAD EVERYWHERE INTO JOINTS AND MANY OF MY FAVORITE ORGANS. TEN WEEKS IN THE HOSPITAL MOST OF IT AT WHAT WAS A CALLED A SELECT CARE FACILITY IN PHOENIX. IT WAS A BAD TIME??HALLUCINATIONS DEPRESSION NIGHTMARES??ALL THE CONNECTIONS TO THE REGULAR WORLD FADING AND THE WORLD PARTICULARLY THE NURSING STAFF WAS AMAZINGLY INDIFFERENT. AND WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THE SORRY STORY OF THAT HOSPITAL I WOULD MENTION THAT TRULY HORRIBLE PEOPLE REVEAL THEMSELVES WHEN YOU ARE HELPLESS AND EXPECTED TO DIE ANY DAY. IN ANY CASE PART OF IT A SMALL PART WAS NOT BEING ABLE TO EAT MEANING I UNDERSTAND WHAT THE DOG IS FEELING NOW. YOU UNDERSTAND BUT CAN??T ACTUALLY REMEMBER I SUPPOSE?? NOT UNTIL IT??S ON YOU AGAIN. *** SUNDAY NIGHT I TALK HIM INTO A FEW BITES OF AMERICAN CHEESE AND A MINT PATTY. LATER??BACK AROUND 3 A.M.??WE MOVE TO THE OUTBUILDING WHERE MY OFFICE IS AND A SPARE BED SO AS NOT TO AWAKEN MRS. DEXTER ANYMORE THAN WE ALREADY HAVE. MRS. DEXTER HAS OVER THE YEARS DEVELOPED AN UNFRIENDLY RESPONSE TO BEING STIRRED AT THIS HOUR KNOWING FROM A LIFETIME OF EXPERIENCE THAT GOOD NEWS DOES NOT COME AT 3 IN THE MORNING. MEANWHILE OVER IN THE OUTBUILDING/OFFICE WE LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN SO THE BEAST CAN COME AND GO AS HE WANTS. THE OUTSIDE TEMPERATURE HAS DROPPED INTO THE LOW 30S AND INSIDE THE TEMPERATURE HAS ALSO DROPPED INTO THE LOW 30S AND THIS TIME I LIFT THE DOG INTO BED BECAUSE WITHOUT HIM I WILL FREEZE. ON FRIDAY BEFORE HE STOPPED EATING HENRY WEIGHED IN AT 131 POUNDS AT DR. PARENT??S OFFICE AND WHATEVER HE WEIGHS NOW MY LIFTING HIM INTO BED IS LIKE THE STORIES YOU SEE NOW AND THEN WHERE GRANDMA LIFTS THE STUDEBAKER OFF JUNIOR WHEN IT FALLS OFF THE JACK. MONDAY THE TEST RESULTS COME IN. STAGE FOUR LYMPHOMA AND YOU ONLY GET FIVE STAGES. THE VET??A DIFFERENT VET A CANCER SPECIALIST??SAYS THAT IF THE CHEMOTHERAPY WORKS HENRY MIGHT LAST ANOTHER YEAR. A GOOD YEAR MAYBE. CHEMO IS EASIER ON DOGS THAN IT IS ON PEOPLE AT LEAST UNTIL IT COMES BACK. AND IT WILL COME BACK SHE IS PRETTY CLEAR ABOUT THAT AND NEXT TIME IT WON??T WORK AS WELL OR FOR AS LONG. AND IT WILL GO ON A YEAR MAYBE MORE IF YOU??RE LUCKY AND IN THE END THE CANCER IS GOING TO WIN. *** AND A WEEK AND A HALF GOES BY. CHEMOTHERAPY EVERY TUESDAY PILLS EVERY MORNING. CHECKING HIS TEMPERATURE. LAST NIGHT HE WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO GET BACK UP ON THE BED BUT WE ARE STILL SLEEPING IN THE OFFICE. AND I AM SITTING HERE THINKING OF ARIZONA OF THE AFTERNOON I FINALLY GOT OUT OF THE LAST HOSPITAL AND WAS SITTING IN A WHEELCHAIR WAITING FOR MRS. DEXTER TO BRING THE CAR AROUND WHEN INSTEAD SHE WALKS IN HOLDING HENRY ON A LEASH. HE SEES ME AND TEARS HIMSELF AND THE LEASH OUT OF HER HAND. HE HAS BEEN IN A KENNEL 10 WEEKS. A HUNDRED POUNDS OF BONE AND MUSCLE WITH A 20-YARD HEAD START AND I AM IN A WHEELCHAIR EMACIATED DOWN TO NOT MUCH BIGGER THAN THE DOG AND IN THAT MOMENT??EQUAL PARTS RELIEF HAPPINESS AND TERROR??I WAS BACK AMONG THE LIVING. AS FOR HENRY I DON??T KNOW WHAT HE WAS THINKING THEN??I NEVER CLAIMED THIS WAS THE SMARTEST ANIMAL IN THE WORLD??OR WHAT HE??S THINKING NOW. HE??S BETTER TODAY THAN YESTERDAY THOUGH AND WAS BETTER YESTERDAY THAN THE DAY BEFORE AND ACCORDING TO THE VET THAT IS HOW IT WILL PROBABLY GO DAY AFTER DAY UNTIL IT DOESN??T. ,30962.0

A HEATED QUARREL MAY HAVE TRIGGERED MALIZA??S BRUTAL ATTACK ON THE YOUNG WOMAN WHO DETECTIVES LATER DETERMINED WAS BADLY BRUISED AND BLOODIED INCLUDING IN HER LOWER BOWEL AREA THE SOURCES SAID.

JUST TWO DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS ROMO HAD BEEN SWOONING AFTER POSTING ON HER FACEBOOK PAGE THAT SHE ??GOT ENGAGED.? THE SAME DAY ROMO POSTED A LOVING AD HOC NOTE OUTING HER CRUSH ON THE MAN WHO APPEARS TO BE HER FIANCE.

THEY REVELED WELL INTO THE EARLY MORNING THE FOLLOWING DAY BEFORE CALLING IT QUITS AT 4 A.M. THE SOURCES SAID.

THE COUPLE EVENTUALLY RETURNED TO THEIR STREET LEVEL QUEENS APARTMENT LOCATED ON 86TH STREET NEAR 91ST AVENUE IN WOODHAVEN. THE TWO HAD SHARED THEIR HOME A CHOPPED-UP SUBDIVISION WHERE THEY RENTED A BEDROOM AND SHARED A COMMON SPACE WITH OTHER TENANTS FOR THE PAST TWO MONTHS. BUT AFTER LEAVING THEIR FRIENDS MALIZA AND ROMO BICKERED AND THE NIGHT WENT SOUTH SOURCES SAID. MALIZA TOLD COPS ACCORDING TO SOURCES THAT THE TWO DECIDED TO TURN IN AROUND 5 A.M.

HE RUSHED TO MAKE THE PHONE CALL TO HIS STEPDAD WHO THE SOURCE SAID DISREGARDED THE GOODBYE AS A LEGITIMATE SUICIDE WARNING AND TOLD MALIZA TO MEET HIM A FEW STREET BLOCKS AWAY FROM THE HOME ON JAMAICA AVENUE. MALIZA MET UP WITH HIS STEPDAD AND TOGETHER THEY RETURNED TO THE APARTMENT. THE STEPDAD IMMEDIATELY CALLED 9-1-1 AT AROUND 10:45 P.M. MALIZA??S SEQUENCE OF EVENTS INITIALLY LED POLICE TO BELIEVE THAT ROMO OVERDOSED.

THE ALBUM OPENS WITH ONE OF DYLAN??S MOST CONTROVERSIAL SONGS: ??HURRICANE.? WIDELY CONSIDERED TO BE HIS LAST GREAT PROTEST SONG IT??S A BRILLIANT EIGHT-MINUTE STATEMENT AGAINST THE WRONGFUL CONVICTION OF MIDDLEWEIGHT BOXER RUBIN \HURRICANE\"" CARTER FOR A GRUESOME 1966 TRIPLE-HOMICIDE IN PATERSON NEW JERSEY. MUCH LIKE NETFLIX??S MAKING A MURDERER IT BROUGHT A DELUGE OF NATIONAL ATTENTION TO THE INJUSTICES OF AMERICA??S LEGAL SYSTEM. IN USING ONE MAN??S SMALL-TOWN LEGAL FIGHT FORTY YEARS EARLIER DYLAN MADE CARTER??S IMPRISONMENT AN INESCAPABLE TOPIC OF PUBLIC CONVERSATION. THE MUSIC ITSELF RAGES AT AN ENTHRALLINGLY BREAKNECK PACE GROWING MORE FIERY WITH EACH VERSE??PUNCTUATED AT ONE POINT BY DYLAN??S INDIGNANT USE OF THE WORD ??NIGGER? TO SCORN THOSE WHO DISMISSED CARTER??S INNOCENCE ON RACIAL GROUNDS. BUT THE LYRICS CO-WRITTEN WITH PLAYWRIGHT JACQUES LEVY TEEM WITH INACCURACY DESPITE THE AUTHORS?? GOOD INTENTIONS. THE PAIR TOOK EXTRAORDINARY POETIC LICENSE WITH THE DETAILS OF THE CASE: ORIGINALLY ACCUSING TWO STAR WITNESSES OF ROBBING THE BODIES LEFT AT THE SCENE (A PROBLEM WHICH RESULTED IN COLUMBIA RECORDS FORCING DYLAN TO RE-RECORD THE SONG JUST BEFORE RELEASE) PAINTING CARTER AS A GENTLE SAINT NEGLECTING TO MENTION ANY OF HIS FAMOUSLY VIOLENT TEMPER AND PREVIOUS RUN-INS WITH THE LAW AND SUGGESTING EYEWITNESS PATRICIA VALENTINE WAS PART OF A POLICE CONSPIRACY TO FRAME CARTER (SHE SUED DYLAN FOR SLANDER AND LOST IN COURT). BUT DYLAN RELENTLESSLY TROTTED OUT THE SONG ON TOUR AND AT BENEFIT SHOWS AND SOME CREDIT THAT INCREASED AWARENESS FOR CARTER??S 1976 RETRIAL??ONE WHICH THE BOXER LOST REMAINING IN JAIL FOR NINE MORE YEARS UNTIL HIS CONVICTION WAS FINALLY OVERTURNED. DYLAN??S PARTNERSHIP WITH LEVY RESULTED IN ANOTHER FAR MORE QUESTIONABLE JOURNALISTIC SONG: ??JOEY.? THE ELEVEN-MINUTE BALLAD IS AN ODE TO NEW YORK MOBSTER ??CRAZY JOE? GALLO WHO WAS FAMOUSLY GUNNED DOWN AT UMBERTO??S CLAM HOUSE IN LITTLE ITALY. LEVY AND DYLAN PAINT THE BRUTAL MOBSTER AS A WRONGFULLY PERSECUTED MAN OF PRINCIPLE. ??WHAT MADE THEM WANT TO COME AND BLOW YOU AWAY?? THE SONG??S CHORUS ASKS. WELL MAYBE IT WAS THE FACT THAT GALLO INITIATED ONE OF THE BLOODIEST MOB WARS OF THE TWENTIETH-CENTURY AND WAS A PATHOLOGICAL KILLER WHO BRAGGED ABOUT MURDERING A MAN IN A BARBER CHAIR AND ALLEGEDLY ORDERED A BRUTAL HIT ON A RIVAL BOSS.?Ÿ ONE VERSE CLAIMS POOR HELPLESS GALLO OPTED NOT TO CARRY A GUN IN HIS LATER YEARS BECAUSE HE DIDN??T WANT HIS CHILDREN TO KNOW VIOLENCE. THAT WOULD BE MORALLY HEROIC IF NOT FOR THE HANDGUN GALLO PULLED OUT WHILE BEING MASSACRED OVER HIS BOWL OF MUSSELS. THE SONG WAS INDEED ??ONE OF THE MOST MINDLESSLY AMORAL PIECES OF ROMANTICIST BULLSHIT EVER RECORDED? AS LESTER BANGS WROTE IN 1976. BUT THE MARTYRING OF SUCH A RUTHLESS FIGURE WAS LIKELY THE RESULT OF GALLO??S MYTHOLOGICAL JAIL STAY IN WHICH THE GANGSTER READ UP ON NIETZSCHE AND BEFRIENDED BLACK INMATES. UPON HIS RELEASE HE MOVED TO GREENWICH VILLAGE AND BEFRIENDED ACTORS AND LITERARY FIGURES??A HIPSTER GOON OF SORTS.?Ÿ BUT THE MELODY IS BEAUTIFUL ESPECIALLY AIDED BY HOWLING BACKUP VOCALS FROM EMMYLOU HARRIS?Ÿ AND RONEE BLAKLEY. AND WHEN TAKEN WITH SOME MEASURE OF SKEPTICISM??AS A REWRITING OF HISTORY OR A PAEAN TO A FICTIONAL ANTI-HERO??IT??S ACTUALLY A GOOD SONG FLAWS BE DAMNED. INTERESTINGLY IN A 2009 INTERVIEW DYLAN CLAIMED HIS PARTNER WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE LYRICS IN ??JOEY.? PERHAPS HE RECOGNIZES THE EGREGIOUSNESS OF THE WORDS TOO. THE DUO ALSO WROTE THE PIANO-DRIVEN ??ISIS? ONE OF DYLAN??S MOST TOWERING ALLEGORIES A HYPNOTIC SEVEN-MINUTE ODYSSEY-LIKE FABLE ABOUT A RAMBLIN?? MAN SEEKING ADVENTURE TRAVELING TO ??PYRAMIDS ALL EMBEDDED IN ICE? ONLY TO DISCOVER AN EMPTY TOMB AND RETURN HOME TO HIS WIFE A ??MYSTICAL CHILD.? WHILE SHROUDED IN MYTHICAL IMAGERY THE SONG WAS ACTUALLY A RARE GLIMPSE INTO DYLAN??S PERSONAL LIFE: IT ALMOST NAKEDLY MIRRORED HIS SEPARATION AND REUNION AT THE TIME WITH SARA DYLAN. ??MOZAMBIQUE? IS A SING-SONGY TUNE THAT ALLEGEDLY EMERGED FROM A COMPETITION BETWEEN DYLAN AND LEVY TO SEE WHO COULD FIND THE MOST WORDS RHYMING WITH THE SOUTHEASTERN AFRICAN COUNTRY??S NAME. AS BREEZILY AS THE SONG CAME TO EXIST IT??S PERHAPS AS EASY TO OVERLOOK. ??ONE MORE CUP OF COFFEE (VALLEY BELOW)? AND ??OH SISTER? HOWEVER ARE INDELIBLE CLASSICS THAT SEE DYLAN EXPERIMENTING WITH MELISMATIC ALMOST-RABBINICAL VOCAL PATTERNS. THE FORMER IS LARGELY SEEN AS YET ANOTHER METAPHOR FOR HIS MARITAL ESTRANGEMENT COMPLETE WITH THEMES OF ABANDONMENT HEARTBREAK AND THE UNKNOWN ROAD AHEAD. THE LATTER SONG MEANWHILE WAS A PENETRATING LOOK AT THE HUMANITY AND FRAGILITY OF LOVE WITH SCARLET RIVERA??S VIOLIN PLAYING AN ENORMOUS ROLE IN SELLING THE SINCERITY. DYLAN??S FANTASTICAL STORYTELLING TOOK ON A NEW LEVEL OF SCREENWRITERLY ATTENTION TO DETAIL WITH ??ROMANCE IN DURANGO? AND ??BLACK DIAMOND BAY? BOTH FEATURED IN THE LATTER THIRD OF THE ALBUM. ??ROMANCE? SOUNDS READS AND FEELS LIKE A NON-EXISTENT SAM PECKINPAH OR SERGIO LEONE FILM ABOUT A MAN AND HIS LOVER MAGDALENA ON THE RUN IN MEXICO DUST ON HIS FACE AND CAPE AS THEY FLEE THE LAW AND ULTIMATELY PERISH TOGETHER IN A FATAL SHOOTOUT. ??BLACK DIAMOND BAY? ON THE OTHER HAND IS A VERBOSE SHORT STORY ABOUT THE INHABITANTS OF AN ISLAND HOTEL WHO EACH FACE DOWN THEIR MORTALITY AFTER A VOLCANO ERUPTS AND ENGULFS THE TINY LANDMASS. THE SONG??S EXPLORATION OF FUTILITY IS UNDERSCORED BY THE FINAL VERSE IN WHICH THE CURTAIN IS PEELED BACK TO REVEAL THE NARRATOR IS JUST AN INDIFFERENT VIEWER OF ??OLD CRONKITE? ON THE NIGHTLY NEWS DETAILING SOME MASS DEATH OR ANOTHER. ??SO I TURNED IT OFF AND WENT TO GRAB ANOTHER BEER? DYLAN SINGS OF HIS BOREDOM. ??SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIME YOU TURN AROUND / THERE??S ANOTHER HARD-LUCK STORY THAT YOU??RE GONNA HEAR / AND THERE??S REALLY NOTHIN?? ANYONE CAN SAY.??Ÿ AND THE KICKER IN OUR COLLECTIVE GUT OF APATHY: ??AND I NEVER DID PLAN TO GO ANYWAY TO BLACK DIAMOND BAY.? WHILE EACH OF THE FIRST EIGHT SONGS OF DESIRE COULD BE THE SUBJECT OF LENGTHY DISCUSSION THE ALBUM??S CLOSER ??SARA? IS PERHAPS ITS MOST FASCINATING FOR ONE REASON: IT??S THE INCREDIBLY RARE MOMENT DYLAN DROPS ALL PRETENSE OF PERSONA AND PUTS HIS PERSONAL LIFE ON PUBLIC DISPLAY. IF AS BOB??S SON JAKOB ONCE SAID 1974??S BLOOD ON THE TRACKS WAS ??[HIS] PARENTS TALKING? THEN ??SARA? IS THE SOUND OF HIS PARENTS ENDING IT FOR GOOD. IT??S A DESPERATE HEARTBREAKINGLY INTIMATE PLEA FROM DYLAN FOR HIS ESTRANGED WIFE NOT TO ABANDON HIM FOREVER. WITH BORGES-LIKE ATTENTION TO BIOGRAPHICAL DETAIL DYLAN REMINISCES ABOUT BEACH TRIPS WITH THE KIDS WATCHING THEM COLLECT SEA SHELLS IN THEIR PAILS VACATIONS IN PORTUGAL AND JAMAICA READING SNOW WHITE WITH THE CHILDREN. HE CONFESSES THAT HE WROTE HIS 1966 EPIC COMPOSITION ??SAD EYED LADY OF THE LOWLANDS? FOR SARA AFTER STAYING UP ALL NIGHT AT THE CHELSEA HOTEL. IT??S ENOUGH TO MAKE THE LISTENER CRY??A RARE FEAT FOR THE TYPICALLY BITING DYLAN??ESPECIALLY WHEN HE LAMENTS THAT ALL THOSE BEACHES ARE NOW METAPHORICALLY SPEAKING ??DESERTED EXCEPT FOR SOME KELP? AND BEGS SARA TO ??FORGIVE ME MY UNWORTHINESS.? THE FAMOUSLY ARROGANT DYLAN WAS PRACTICALLY LYING NAKED ON THE FLOOR WEEPING FOR ALL TO SEE.

NOT COUNTING ONE CHRISTMAS-THEMED EPISODE HAMMOND TOOK OVER THE REINS AFTER APPEARING ALONGSIDE KILLAM AND THE REAL TRUMP IN NOVEMBER. HIS GRAND RETURN CULMINATED IN THIS PAST WEEK??S COLD OPEN FEATURING ANOTHER FORMER CAST MEMBER: TINA FEY AS SARAH PALIN. DURING THE FINAL EPISODE OF 2015 HAMMOND??S TRUMP RE-ENTERED THE FOLD OUT OF WHAT APPEARED TO BE NECESSITY DURING A GOP DEBATE SKETCH THAT ALSO FEATURED KILLAM AS TED CRUZ WHOM HE HAS BEEN PLAYING ON THE SHOW FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS. BY THE FIRST EPISODE OF 2016 TRUMP AND CRUZ WERE THE TWO FRONTRUNNERS IN THE REPUBLICAN RACE WHICH MEANT HAMMOND AND KILLAM FACED OFF ONCE MORE THIS TIME OVER THE MEANING OF ??NEW YORK VALUES.? PRODUCERS CLEARLY FELT KILLAM WASN??T READY TO PULL DOUBLE-DUTY AS BOTH TRUMP AND CRUZ REPLICATING THE FEAT DANA CARVEY PULLED OFF DURING THE 1992 ELECTION WHEN HE PLAYED BOTH GEORGE H.W. BUSH AND ROSS PEROT IN THE SAME SKETCH. AT THAT POINT IN SNL??S HISTORY PHIL HARTMAN WAS FEELING AMERICA??S PAIN AS BILL CLINTON. (FUN FACT: DAVID SPADE WAS TOLD BY THE SHOW HE WOULD BE PLAYING PEROT AND EVEN PERFECTED HIS IMPRESSION BUT LATER DISCOVERED HE WOULD ONLY BE USED IN WIDE SHOTS TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THERE WERE THREE PEOPLE ON THE DEBATE STAGE.) ??I WASN??T PLANNING ON BEING IN ANY SKETCHES? HAMMOND TOLD ESQUIRE MAGAZINE LAST SPRING AFTER HE FIRST RE-APPEARED AS FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON DURING SEASON 40. ??I LIKE THE ANNOUNCER THING BECAUSE YOU CAN DO IT FROM NEW ORLEANS OR YOU CAN JUST COME TO NEW YORK FOR TWO WEEKS AND THEN GO BACK. BUT THEN [WHEN I LEARNED] THAT KATE MCKINNON WAS GONNA BE HILLARY THEN I WENT ??OKAY. I HAVE TO DO IT.?? I MEAN THIS KID IS A VIRTUOSO. YOU DON??T EVEN KNOW WHAT THIS GIRL CAN DO HOW GOOD SHE IS. SHE??S OUT OF THIS WORLD.? BUT THOSE COMMENTS DO NOT FULLY EXPLAIN WHY HAMMOND DECIDED TO START PLAYING TRUMP ON WHAT HAS BECOME A WEEKLY BASIS. IF HE NEEDED CONVINCING TO ESSENTIALLY REJOIN THE CAST IT HAS PAID OFF FOR BOTH THE SHOW AND VIEWERS. TRUMP HAS BECOME SUCH A LARGER-THAN-LIFE FIGURE IN THE AMERICAN POLITICAL CONVERSATION THAT HE NEEDS TO BE PLAYED BY A COMEDIAN WHO CAN IMITATE THE GRAVITAS THE CANDIDATE HIMSELF CLAIMS TO POSSESS. JUST AS ONLY TINA FEY CAN BE SARAH PALIN IN THE PUBLIC IMAGINATION DARRELL HAMMOND IS OUR ONE AND ONLY DONALD TRUMP. THE SAME GOES FOR ANOTHER OF THIS ELECTION CYCLE??S MOST INDELIBLE CHARACTERS: BERNIE SANDERS. I??M SURE KYLE MOONEY OR BECK BENNETT COULD PULL OFF A DECENT ENOUGH SANDERS IMPRESSION BUT THE WORLD WANTED TO SEE LARRY DAVID AS THE VERMONT SOCIALIST AND SNL HAS DELIVERED THAT DREAM CASTING NOW ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS. THE SHOW HAS ALREADY TAPPED DAVID TO HOST ON FEBRUARY 6 WHICH JUST HAPPENS TO BE THE FIRST SHOW TO AIR FOLLOWING THE IOWA CAUCUS. EXPECT MULTIPLE BERNIE SANDERS SKETCHES IN THAT EPISODE. TRUMP HILLARY CRUZ AND BERNIE ARE THE FOUR BIGGEST PLAYERS IN THE 2016 ELECTION SO FAR BUT ONLY TWO OF THEM ARE BEING PLAYED BY FULL-TIME CAST MEMBERS. AND ONLY KATE MCKINNON??S CLINTON RISES TO THE ICONIC LEVEL OF PERFORMANCES LIKE FERRELL AS GEORGE W. BUSH WHO ALSO CAME OUT OF RETIREMENT THIS YEAR TO REMIND US HOW MUCH WE MISS HIM ON SNL. IMAGINE THAT DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON ARE THE GENERAL ELECTION NOMINEES??NOT AN UNLIKELY SCENARIO AS EACH CANDIDATE IS LEADING IN THEIR RESPECTIVE NATIONAL POLLS. THAT WOULD LEAVE HAMMOND PORTRAYING BOTH THE REPUBLICAN CONTENDER AND THE ASPIRING FIRST GENTLEMAN DURING WHAT WOULD SURELY BE THE MOST HEAVILY WATCHED SNL EPISODES OF 2016. AT 60 YEARS OLD HAMMOND IS AT LEAST TWICE THE AGE OF NEARLY EVERY OTHER SNL CAST MEMBER CURRENTLY ON THE SHOW (ASIDE FROM LESLIE JONES WHO AT 47 BECAME THE OLDEST ACTOR EVER HIRED BY LORNE MICHAELS LAST YEAR). FROM THE BEGINNING SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A YOUNG PERSON??S GAME. BUT MORE THAN TWO DECADES AFTER HE FIRST JOINED THE CAST HAMMOND IS SUDDENLY SNL??S MVP. ,28072.0

THAT??S BAIT.? TRUMP SAYS IT??S NECESSARY TO END GUN FREE ZONES DUE TO THE RECENT SPATE OF TERRORIST ATTACKS SUCH AS THOSE IN PARIS AND CALIFORNIA.

FOR OUR ENEMIES AND THE DANGEROUSLY INSANE TO EXPLOIT.? THE GROUP NOTED THAT AT THE CNBC DEBATE LAST YEAR WHERE TRUMP BRAGGED ABOUT BEING ONE OF THE FEW NEW YORK CITY RESIDENTS TO HAVE A CONCEALED CARRY PERMIT BUT ASKED HIM POINT-BLANK IF HE WOULD END THE GUN FREE DESIGNATION AT HIS PROPERTIES. ??WE CALLED A FEW TRUMP RESORTS A FEW TRUMP PROPERTIES THAT DO NOT ALLOW GUNS WITH OR WITHOUT A PERMIT. WOULD YOU CHANGE THOSE POLICIES?? MODERATOR CARL QUINTANILLA ASKED. ??I WOULD CHANGE THEM? TRUMP TERSELY REPLIED. YET SO FAR THE POLICIES HAVEN??T BEEN REVERSED ON TRUMP PROPERTIES. ??IF DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO EARN THE SUPPORT OF GUN OWNERS HE NEEDS TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON THAT PROMISE? THE GROUP??S STATEMENT CONTINUED. GUN OWNERS OF AMERICA ENDORSED TED CRUZ IN SEPTEMBER IN PART THE GROUP SAID BECAUSE HE WAS THE ONLY CANDIDATE WHO ??COMPLETED AND RETURNED THE GOA PRESIDENTIAL SURVEY ON THE SECOND AMENDMENT.? THEY DESCRIBE THE FIRST-TERM TEXAS SENATOR AS SOMEONE WHO WILL BE A ??STALWART DEFENDER OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT IN THE WHITE HOUSE? AND ??WILL HELP SHOULDER THE BURDEN OF FIGHTING AGAINST THE GUN GRABBERS DEDICATED TO EVISCERATING THE SECOND AMENDMENT.? CRUZ HAS OVERTAKEN TRUMP IN THE FIRST IN THE NATION CAUCUS STATE OF IOWA BUT HAS REFRAINED FROM CHALLENGING TRUMP PRESUMABLY SO CRUZ CAN INHERIT THOSE VOTERS SHOULD THE TRUMP PHENOMENON FADE. BUT THE CRITICISM FROM THE GOA COULD SYMBOLIZE A NEW TURN IN THE RACE AS THEY ARE THE FIRST CRUZ-BACKED GROUP TO DIRECTLY TAKE ON THE REAL ESTATE MAGNATE CHALLENGING HIM FROM A POPULIST TALK-SHOW-INFLUENCED RIGHT FLANK. FOR HIS PART CRUZ HAS TOUTED THE GOA??S ENDORSEMENT SAYING AT A CNN DEBATE THAT HE WON THEIR SUPPORT FOR OPPOSING NEW BACKGROUND CHECKS IN THE WAKE OF THE MASSACRE OF SCHOOL CHILDREN IN NEWTOWN CONNECTICUT. ??I WAS HONORED TO BE ENDORSED BY GUN OWNERS OF AMERICA AS THE STRONGEST SUPPORTER OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT ON THE STAGE TODAY? CRUZ SAID. GOA WHICH BOASTS OVER 300000 MEMBERS WAS FOUNDED IN 1975 AND HAS LARGELY SERVED AS A FOIL TO THE MUCH LARGER NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION WHICH THE GROUP ACCUSES OF BEING TOO WILLING TO COMPROMISE ON THE ISSUE OF GUN RIGHTS. IN 2008 FOR EXAMPLE THE GROUP WAS VOCIFEROUS IN THEIR CRITICISM OF NRA-ENDORSED REPUBLICAN NOMINEE JOHN MCCAIN WHOM THEY DESCRIBED AS A ??LIBERAL GUN GRABBER.? THE GROUP GAVE HIM A D- RATING. THE GOA HAS BEEN CRITICIZED BY EVEN SOME SECOND AMENDMENT SUPPORTERS FOR ITS EXTREMISM AND FOR THE TIES SOME OF ITS LEADERSHIP HAVE TO WHITE EXTREMIST OUTFITS. BUT BY PRODDING TRUMP ON THE POLICIES OF HIS PROPERTIES THE GROUP IS ALSO CALLING ATTENTION TO A FACT THAT HAS LARGELY GONE UNREMARKED UPON IN THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL RACE: MANY OF THE LOCATIONS THAT BEAR THE REAL ESTATE MOGUL??S NAME ARE NOT IN FACT RUN BY HIM AND USE HIS NAME STRICTLY FOR MARKETING PURPOSES. THIS IS NOT A NEW ISSUE FOR TRUMP. HE??S FACED LAWSUITS FROM BUYERS AT THREE-SEPARATE TRUMP-BRANDED PROPERTIES WHO SAY THAT HE MISLED THEM INTO BELIEVING THAT HE WAS THE DEVELOPER OF THEM. BUT AS THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORTED IN 2011 WHEN THE PLANNED BUILDINGS ENCOUNTERED FINANCIAL TROUBLE IT BECAME CLEAR THAT TRUMP MERELY RENTED HIS NAME TO THE DEVELOPMENTS AND HAD NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT THEN BECAME OF THEM ALLOWING TRUMP TO KEEP THE LICENSING FEES WHILE THE WOULD-BE BUYERS LOST THEIR DEPOSITS. A NUMBER OF TRUMP PROPERTIES IN WHICH THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL FRONT-RUNNER DOES STILL OWN REMAIN GUN-FREE ZONES AMONG THEM TRUMP INTERNATIONAL HOTEL AND TOWER IN CHICAGO TRUMP NATIONAL GULF CLUB IN LOS ANGELES AND TRUMP INTERNATIONAL HOTEL WAIKIKI BEACH WALK IN HONOLULU.

FIRST SECURITY AT TRUMP??S RALLY REMOVED HOUGH A CONVERT TO ISLAM AND A CHARLOTTE MOSQUE SPOKESMAN WHEN HE CHANTED ??ISLAM IS NOT THE PROBLEM!? THEN HAMID 56 WAS ESCORTED OUT AFTER SHE ROSE TO HER FEET IN SILENT PROTEST??WEARING A T-SHIRT WITH THE MESSAGE ??SALAM I COME IN PEACE? AND A YELLOW STAR BEARING THE WORD ??MUSLIM? AFFIXED TO HER CHEST.

ROSENBLUTH HAD WORKED FOR YEARS WITH HOUGH AND EDITH GARWOOD OF AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL. THEY SHOUTED THEY SCREAMED AND THEY GOT THROWN OUT BUT THEY DIDN??T GET MUCH MEDIA ATTENTION. AN NBCNEWS.COM ARTICLE ??TRUMP INTERRUPTED TEN TIMES AT NORTH CAROLINA RALLY? FAILED TO MENTION THEIR PROTEST. THE ACTIVISTS REGROUPED FOR A SECOND SHOT: A TOWN HALL ON DEC. 12 AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA CAMPUS IN AIKEN S.C. NOTICING THAT THEIR SHOUTS WERE BEING USED AS GROUNDS FOR REMOVAL THEY DECIDED TO TURN (MOSTLY) TO SILENT PROTEST. ROSENBLUTH TOLD THE TEAM ABOUT AN IMAGE FROM EUROPE THAT HE THOUGHT THEY COULD USE TO ILLUSTRATE THEIR CAUSE: AN EIGHT-POINTED YELLOW STAR THAT WAS REMINISCENT OF THE SIX-POINTED STAR OF DAVID THAT JEWS WERE FORCED TO WEAR DURING THE HOLOCAUST. SWISS MUSLIMS HAD USED THE YELLOW STAR WITH ??MUSLIM? WRITTEN ACROSS IT IN PROTESTS IN 2011 AN ACTION THAT JEWISH LEADERS HAD PROTESTED AS OFFENSIVE APPROPRIATION OF HOLOCAUST IMAGERY. ROSENBLUTH STARTED A FACEBOOK PAGE ??GO YELLOW AGAINST HATE? AND THE TEAM CREATED ITS OWN STARS WITH ??NO RACISM? AND ??STOP ISLAMOPHOBIA? WRITTEN ON SOME.

HAMID WROTE IN: ??PLEASE MAKE ME ONE.

MEANWHILE STAGE LEFT A BIT ROSENBLUTH TOOK TO FACEBOOK TO POST A PHOTO OF HIMSELF WITH THE CAPTION ??GUESS WHERE I AM!? HE HAD JUST MET HAMID FOR THE FIRST TIME THOUGH HE HAD KNOWN OF HER FOR YEARS AND THEY MOVED DOWN FURTHER THAN THE OTHER FIVE ACTIVISTS. AS HOUGH SHOUTED HAMID STOOD UP IN PROTEST WITH ROSENBLUTH BESIDE HER. IN RESPONSE SECURITY PULLED HIM OUT AND THEN THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT FINALLY EXPELLING THE ROW OF FIVE REMAINING ACTIVISTS. OUTSIDE THE VENUE ROSENBLUTH UPDATED HIS FACEBOOK FRIENDS: ??ONCE AGAIN WE GOT THEM TO DISRUPT THEIR OWN RALLY.? LATER ON FACEBOOK HE TOLD HOUGH: ??IT WAS AN HONOR AND A PLEASURE TO PROTEST WITH YOU SIR.? ??I JUST SHUT DOWN THE TRUMP RALLY FOR THE SECOND TIME? THE MOSQUE SPOKESMAN WROTE. A FRIEND FROM CHARLOTTE JOKED: ??SORRY JIBRIL YOU DIDNT MAKE CNN YET.? THE ANTI-TRUMP EIGHT REGROUPED AT A RESTAURANT WHERE THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT GOT A CALL FROM CNN. HAMID AND HER FRIEND PILED BACK INTO THE CAMARO TO RETURN TO THE RALLY WHERE MEDIA TRUCKS WERE LINED UP. SHE DID THE INTERVIEW WITH HER FRIEND OFF CAMERA. WITHIN AN HOUR OF HER CNN APPEARANCE MUSLIM ACTIVISTS AND OTHERS STARTED SPREADING THE MESSAGE OF THE PROTEST AND THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT HAD BECOME THE MOVEMENT??S OWN MEME: ??#ROSEHAMID #RESPECT YOUR COURAGE & BRAVERY.? THE DEMOCRATIC WOMEN OF UNION COUNTY N.C.

SAWYERS NODDED FLASHING BACK TO THOSE YEARS. ??ONE THING I WAS STRUCK BY WHEN I READ DREAMS FROM MY FATHER WHEN I HAD JUST GRADUATED COLLEGE AND I WAS STILL IN PARTY MODE WAS WHEN I GOT TO THE POINT WHERE HE SAID HE USED TO SMOKE WEED AND WHEN YOU HAD MONEY YOU??D GET SOME COKE? HE SAID. ??I WAS LIKE ??HE SAID THAT IN HIS BOOK? IS HE CRAZY? BUT IT??S INDICATIVE OF WHO HE IS AND WHO THEY ARE AS PEOPLE.

I??M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THE RESULTS OF THOSE CHANGES BUT I THINK IT EVEN STARTS BEFORE THAT.? BUT FIRST SHE SAID HOLLYWOOD??S STUDIO EXECS AND FINANCIERS HAVE TO START CHANGING THEIR WAY OF THINKING AND ??TAKE MORE RISKS ON FILMS LIKE THIS.? ??THAT??S ONE OF THE REASONS I DID THIS??ŸSHE SAID. \MICHELLE OBAMA TO ME MEANS ANYTHING??S POSSIBLE.

THERE WAS NO AGENDA WHEN WE FILMED THIS.? I POINT OUT THAT THE SEXUAL CHEMISTRY BETWEEN THEIR BARACK AND MICHELLE CRACKLES QUITE A BIT ONSCREEN A MOST UNUSUAL WAY TO SEE A SITTING PRESIDENT. ??WE SEE PICTURES AND THEY??RE TOUCHING EACH OTHER? SUMPTER SMILED. ??THERE??S SOMETHING GOING ON.? ??THEY WERE 28 25 AND THEY WEREN??T BEING DISSECTED BY ANYBODY? SAWYERS ADDED.

FORTUNATELY FOR ME I??M A COMEDIAN. IT??S MY JOB TO MAKE FUN OF PEOPLE AND IT??S AN ABSOLUTE PLEASURE. BUT MOST PEOPLE IN AMERICA CAN??T GET AWAY WITH PUBLICLY MAKING FUN OF PEOPLE??S ETHNICITY BECAUSE IT??S ??POLITICALLY INCORRECT.? BUT WHAT DOES ??POLITICAL CORRECTNESS? REALLY ACCOMPLISH IN AMERICA? RECENTLY I FILMED A DOCUMENTARY SERIES FOR NETFLIX EXPLORING FOUR DIFFERENT SUBJECT MATTERS: RACISM MARRIAGE SILICON VALLEY AND DRUGS. FOR THE EPISODE ON RACISM I HAD A ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSION WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE MEDIA ACTION NETWORK FOR ASIAN AMERICANS THE ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE THE NAACP THE NATIONAL HISPANIC MEDIA COALITION AMERICAN INDIANS IN FILM & TELEVISION THE COUNCIL ON AMERICAN-ISLAMIC RELATIONS. WE WERE THERE TO DISCUSS THE WAY I AND SOME OTHERS IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY OFTEN TALK ABOUT??AND MAKE STEREOTYPICAL FUN OF??ASIANS JEWS BLACKS AMERICAN INDIANS AND MUSLIMS NOT NECESSARILY IN THAT ORDER (AND BY NO MEANS IS THAT LIST ALL-INCLUSIVE). WE HAD AN HONEST DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT IT??S FUNNY APPROPRIATE HELPFUL OR HURTFUL TO TRAFFIC IN ETHNIC RACIAL AND RELIGIOUS STEREOTYPES. I KNOW STEREOTYPES AND POLITICALLY INCORRECT LANGUAGE ARE HURTFUL TO SOME PEOPLE BUT AS WE TALKED ONE-ON-ONE THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS??EACH OF THEM OUTSTANDING ORGANIZATIONS DOING VALUABLE WORK TO HIGHLIGHT THE ETHNIC RACIAL AND RELIGIOUS SENSITIVITIES OF AMERICANS CONCERNING THE WAYS WE TALK TO AND ABOUT EACH OTHER??ALL ENDED UP SMILING AND LAUGHING ABOUT EXAMPLES OF POLITICALLY INCORRECT HUMOR BECAUSE THEY COULD SEE I WAS SINCERELY JOKING. THERE??S A VAST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHITE OFFICERS CHASING DOWN AND KILLING UNARMED BLACK MEN VERSUS MAKING A JOKE ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE BEING LATE. AND WHILE WE??RE AT IT: NAACP STANDS FOR THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF COLORED PEOPLE? NO ONE THINKS THIS ACRONYM NEEDS AN UPDATE? NOW I DON??T MEAN TO SHORTCHANGE THE REAL DAMAGE THAT POLITICAL INCORRECTNESS CAUSES. BLACK COMEDIANS ARE FAMOUS FOR USING THE N-WORD IN THEIR COMEDY WITHOUT ANYONE RAISING AN OBJECTION BUT I WOULDN??T DARE USE THAT WORD MYSELF SINCE I STILL FEEL LOUSY ABOUT NORTH AMERICA??S 400-YEAR AWARD-WINNING RECORD OF MISTREATING BLACK PEOPLE. BUT IF THE BLACK COMMUNITY THINK THE N-WORD IS FUNNY WELL THEN MORE BLACK POWER TO THEM AND MAZEL TOV TO EVERYBODY??AND YET EVEN THOUGH THE CLASSICAL DEFINITION OF COMEDY IS TRAGEDY PLUS TIME IT REMAINS UNFUNNY WHEN A WHITE PERSON USES THE N-WORD.?Ÿ IN THE SAME VEIN AMERICA??S CAPITAL CITY OF WASHINGTON D.C. HAS LITTLE BUSINESS CALLING ITS FOOTBALL TEAM THE ??REDSKINS? AFTER EUROPEAN AMERICANS DID THEIR SMALLPOX-AND-IMPERIAL-BEST TO OBLITERATE THE NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATION. THE GERMANS DON??T HAVE A BUNDESLIGA SOCCER TEAM CALLED THE BERLIN JEWS FOR A REASON. IF NATIVE AMERICANS WANT TO GO AHEAD AND JOKE ABOUT THEIR SKIN COLOR I HAVE NO RESERVATIONS. OBVIOUSLY WE DON??T WANT A NATION FULL OF NASTY RACISTS AND HEARTFELT MISANTHROPES TRUMPETING THEIR SPITE ON PROUD PUBLIC DISPLAY BUT WE DO WANT PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO HONESTLY EXPRESS THEMSELVES AND KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HUMOR AND MALICE. THIS IS AMERICA AFTER ALL AND THE FIRST AMENDMENT DESERVES TO COME FIRST. S??REN KIERKEGAARD THAT DOUR 1800S DANISH DELIGHT MADE A REALLY GOOD POINT WHEN HE WROTE ??PEOPLE DEMAND FREEDOM OF SPEECH AS A COMPENSATION FOR THE FREEDOM OF THOUGHT WHICH THEY SELDOM USE.? AND THAT??S THE NUT??OR TESTICLE??OF THE PROBLEM: WE WANT PEOPLE TO SPEAK THEIR MINDS??IF ONLY THEY??D USE THEIR MINDS FOR JUST A SPLIT-SECOND BEFORE THEY SPOKE INSTEAD OF BLURTING OUT THE FIRST STUPID THING THAT BUBBLES UP. ANOTHER EUROPEAN SMARTY-PANTS ARTHUR SCHOPENHAUER THAT GREAT GERMAN PHILOSOPHER FROM THE SAME ERA WASN??T KIDDING AROUND WHEN HE WROTE ??A SENSE OF HUMOR IS THE ONLY DIVINE QUALITY OF MAN.? WITHOUT A SENSE OF HUMOR COMMUNICATION AND CONVERSATION AMONG MEN WOMEN HERMAPHRODITES AND TRANSGENDERED ALIKE WOULD ALL BE HOPELESS AND IF YOU??VE EVER MET SOMEONE??ESPECIALLY A HERMAPHRODITE??WITHOUT A SENSE OF HUMOR YOU KNOW DAMN WELL THAT THE SITUATION IS HOPELESS. SO WHAT??S NEEDED IS NOT POLITICAL CORRECTNESS BUT RATHER MORE APPRECIATION OF AMERICAN HISTORY MORE SELF-CONFIDENCE IN EACH OF OUR INDIVIDUAL AMERICAN SOULS SOME JOY IN OUR HEARTS AND A COLLECTIVE SENSE OF HUMOR IF WE??RE ALL GOING TO GET ALONG AND TALK ABOUT WHAT WEIRD TRIBAL-ETHNIC-RELIGIOUS-RACIAL DNA PERFUME AND SKIN TONE EACH OF US IS WEARING. AMERICANS HAVE GIVEN POLITICAL CORRECTNESS A TRY AND IT??S NOT WORKING. WE??RE BETTER OFF JUST SAYING WHAT??S ON OUR MIND??AND THINKING ABOUT IT BEFORE WE SAY IT??AND LAUGHING ABOUT IT AFTER WE SAY IT. JUST AS THERE??S NOTHING FUNNY ABOUT DEATH CANCER ABORTION SUICIDE POVERTY AND A BROKEN HEART THAT CERTAINLY DOESN??T MEAN WE SHOULDN??T JOKE ABOUT EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THOSE TRAGEDIES. LIKEWISE A GOOD LAUGH OVER AMERICA??S FAILED EXPERIMENT IN POLITICAL CORRECTNESS IS THE ORDER OF THE DAY. PLEASE I??M BEGGING YOU AMERICA: MAKE FUN OF THIS JEW-MORMON GIRL WHOSE GRANDFATHER WAS A SOLDIER IN HITLER??S GERMAN ARMY.

JOE MCCARTHY. SURE HE PEPPERS HIS CONVERSATIONS WITH REFERENCES TO LUDWIG VON MISES AND FRIEDRICH HAYEK TWO ??AUSTRIAN SCHOOL? ECONOMISTS IMPORTANT TO LIBERTARIANS AND HE GENUFLECTS REGULARLY IN THE DIRECTION OF CUTTING THE SIZE SCOPE AND SPENDING OF GOVERNMENT (ONE LOOSE DEFINITION OF LIBERTARIAN POLITICS). THAT IS UNLESS YOU??RE TALKING ABOUT DEFENSE SPENDING WHICH CAN ALWAYS BE JACKED UP EVEN WITHOUT PAYING FOR ANY INCREASES. THE PLAIN TRUTH IS THAT TED CRUZ IS NOT AT ALL LIBERTARIAN BUT IF HE WANTS TO SUCCEED IN THE GOP NOMINATING PROCESS??AND ESPECIALLY THE GENERAL ELECTION IN NOVEMBER??HE MIGHT WANT TO START FOLLOWING MISES RATHER THAN MERELY INVOKING HIM. ??MEN ARE FIGHTING? MISES AN ARCH INTERNATIONALIST AND COSMOPOLITAN ONCE SURMISED ??BECAUSE THEY ARE CONVINCED THAT THE EXTERMINATION OF ADVERSARIES IS THE ONLY MEANS OF PROMOTING THEIR OWN WELL-BEING.? SUCH SENTIMENTS ARE VERY MUCH AT ODDS WITH CRUZ WHO HAS RANTED ABOUT CARPET BOMBING THE MIDDLE EAST SO THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO ANSWER??FINALLY!??THE AGE-OLD QUESTION OF WHETHER ??SAND CAN GLOW IN THE DARK.? LIBERTARIANS ARE NOT PACIFISTS OR ISOLATIONISTS BY ANY STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION BUT NEITHER ARE WE AT ONE WITH THE WAR HYSTERICS POSSESSING THE FOLKS GUNNING FOR THE GOP (AND DEMOCRATIC IF YOU??RE HILLARY CLINTON) NOMINATION. AS A RULE LIBERTARIANS ALSO SUPPORT MAKING THE BORDERS MORE OPEN TO MORE PEOPLE AND GOODS FROM ABROAD WHILE CRUZ IS ARGUABLY EVEN MORE ANTI-IMMIGRANT THAN DONALD TRUMP. TRUMP AFTER ALL (PDF) WOULD LET THE ??GOOD? MEXICANS BACK IN AFTER DEPORTING THEM. MEANWHILE CRUZ??S FLIP-FLOPPING ON TRADE-PROMOTION AUTHORITY AND THE TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP SEEMS FAR MORE MOTIVATED BY POLITICS THAN PRINCIPLE. AND IT SEEMS THAT CRUZ RARELY GOES A DAY WITHOUT PALLING AROUND WITH DEATH-TO-THE-GAYS EVANGELICALS AND INSISTING THAT ??ANY PRESIDENT WHO DOESN??T BEGIN EVERY DAY ON HIS KNEES ISN??T FIT TO BE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THIS COUNTRY.? THAT SORT OF THING ALIENATES ALL THE LIBERTARIANS I KNOW NONE MORE SO THAN THE RELIGIOUS ONES WHO ESPECIALLY WANT TO KEEP GOVERNMENT AND FAITH SEPARATE (SO THAT POLITICS DOESN??T BEFOUL RELIGION). UNFORTUNATELY FOR CRUZ ALIENATING LIBERTARIANS IS NO WAY TO WIN THE GOP NOMINATION OR THE WHITE HOUSE. WHILE HE??S LEADING POLLS GOING INTO THE IOWA CAUCUSES AT THE START OF FEBRUARY HE??S ONLY IN THE THIRD PLACE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE (BEHIND DONALD TRUMP AND MARCO RUBIO) AND HE??S 20 POINTS BEHIND THE DONALD NATIONALLY. HE??S IN A DEAD HEAT WITH HILLARY CLINTON IN HEAD-TO-HEAD MATCHUPS. WHEN IT COMES TO THE GENERAL ELECTION REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES HAVE WON A MAJORITY OF THE POPULAR VOTE ONLY ONCE SINCE 1988 (THAT WAS GEORGE W. BUSH IN 2004). COME NOVEMBER REPUBLICANS WILL NEED ALL THE VOTES THEY CAN GET??AND THOSE VOTES ARE NOT GOING TO COME FROM THE DWINDLING NUMBER OF HARD-CORE SOCIAL CONSERVATIVES THAT RELIABLY TURN OUT FOR THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE. THEY MIGHT HOWEVER COME FROM LIBERTARIAN-LEANING VOTERS ESPECIALLY IF THE GOP COULD DROP ITS CULTURE-WARRING AND ACTUALLY LIVE UP TO ITS ENDLESSLY PROFESSED IDEALS OF MAKING THE GOVERNMENT SMALLER IN ALL AREAS OF OUR LIVES. TWO SCHOLARS AT THE CATO INSTITUTE DAVID BOAZ AND DAVID KIRBY ARGUE THAT ABOUT 15 PERCENT (PDF) OF THE AMERICAN ELECTORATE IS RELIABLY LIBERTARIAN??THAT IS SOCIALLY LIBERAL AND FISCALLY CONSERVATIVE??AND THAT UPWARDS OF 70 PERCENT OF THEM WILL VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS WHEN OFFERED A CANDIDATE NOT OVERLY NOXIOUS TO THE FULL RANGE OF LIBERTARIAN SENSIBILITIES. POLLSTERS AT ZOGBY GALLUP AND PEW FIND LARGER PERCENTAGES OF LIBERTARIANS BASED ON RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT IN PROMOTING MORALS REGULATING THE ECONOMY AND PROVIDING BASIC GOODS AND SERVICES. IN ANY GIVEN NATIONAL ELECTION THE LIBERTARIAN VOTE IS ENOUGH TO SWING THINGS IN ONE DIRECTION OR ANOTHER. THAT MAY ALSO HOLD TRUE IN VARIOUS REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES TOO. AND FOR ALL HIS REACTIONARY POSITIONS CRUZ DOES APPROACH LIBERTARIAN SENSIBILITIES IN SOME MEANINGFUL WAYS. HE??S IN FAVOR OF STRONG SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS AND AMONG THE GOP HOPEFULS HE IS SECOND ONLY TO RAND PAUL ON ENDING BULK COLLECTION OF METADATA AND REINING IN THE SURVEILLANCE STATE. HE HAS BEEN OUTSPOKEN AGAINST IDIOTIC AND ENVIRONMENTALLY DESTRUCTIVE CORN-BASED ETHANOL MANDATES A POSITION THAT SURPRISINGLY HASN??T HURT HIM IN IOWA. AND CRUZ SAYS THAT HE IS A STRONG FEDERALIST MEANING THAT MOST POLITICAL DECISIONS SHOULD BE PUSHED DOWN TO THE MOST LOCAL AND THEORETICALLY REPRESENTATIVE LEVEL POSSIBLE AMONG FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THIS IS WHY HE TALKS ABOUT HAVING THE DEFINITION OF MARRIAGE DECIDED BY THE STATES RATHER THAN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. OF COURSE HAD THE SUPREME COURT RULED DIFFERENTLY LAST YEAR ON THE MATTER ONE ASSUMES CRUZ WOULD BE OK WITH THAT TOO BECAUSE HE RARELY MISSES AN OPPORTUNITY TO INVOKE ??TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE?. THAT??S THE MAIN PROBLEM WITH FEDERALISM IN THE END: IT IS ALWAYS RESULTS-DRIVEN AND DEPENDING ON WHAT A PARTICULAR PERSON WANTS IN A GIVEN SITUATION HE WILL ALWAYS CLAIM AN EXEMPTION TO A GENERAL RULE. JUST ASK THE DEMOCRATS DURING THE CONTESTED 2000 ELECTION WHEN THEY REVERSED EVERYTHING THEIR PARTY STOOD FOR AND INSISTED THAT NO REALLY THE FLORIDA VOTE WAS A STATE ISSUE. AND ASK THE REPUBLICANS WHO INSISTED THAT NO REALLY THE FATE OF TERRI SCHIAVO WAS A PRESSING CONCERN FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE STATE??S RIGHTS POSITIONS CRUZ TYPICALLY TAKES ARE NOT LIBERTARIAN DAVID BOAZ TOLD ME IN A RECENT INTERVIEW. ??A FIRM FEDERALIST WOULD PUSH FOR THE REPEAL OF FEDERAL DRUG LAWS? SAID BOAZ THE EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE CATO INSTITUTE AND AUTHOR OF LAST YEAR??S THE LIBERTARIAN MIND. ??CRUZ DOESN??T DO THAT.? CRUZ ALSO BELIEVES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD GOVERN ABORTION WHICH MAKES YOU WONDER WHY HE THINKS GAY MARRIAGE SHOULD BE LEFT UP TO THE STATES. THAT SAID THERE??S OVERLAP ON SOME ISSUES THAT MIGHT PROVIDE COMMON GROUND BETWEEN CRUZ AND LIBERTARIANS. CRUZ HAS RECENTLY ??EVOLVED? ON MARIJUANA AND AFTER ATTACKING PRESIDENT OBAMA FOR FAILING TO ENFORCE FEDERAL LAW IN COLORADO AND WASHINGTON NOW SAYS HE??S OPEN TO THE STATES EXPERIMENTING WITH LEGALIZED POT. BOAZ RIGHTLY OBSERVED TO ME THAT CRUZ TURNS OFF LIBERTARIANS ??WITH HIS HEAVY EMPHASIS ON EVANGELICAL ISSUES? SUCH AS GAY MARRIAGE AND ABORTION. THE APOCALYPTIC EXTREMITY OF HIS RHETORIC IS OFF-PUTTING EVEN BEYOND ITS CONTENTS AND THERE??S A STRONG CASE THAT CRUZ HAS BLOWN UP ANY POSSIBLE OF RAPPROCHMENT WITH LIBERTARIAN VOTERS. BUT HE??AND THE REST OF THE GOP FIELD AS WELLY??WOULD DO WELL TO START COURTING LIBERTARIANS IF THEY??RE SERIOUS ABOUT DRIVING ALL THE WAY TO THE HOOP IN THE 2016 CAMPAIGN. WHOEVER BECOMES THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE IS IN LUCK FOR HE WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY FACE HILLARY CLINTON A CANDIDATE AS REPUGNANT ON VIRTUALLY EVERY LEVEL AS THE CURRENT CROP OF REPUBLICANS. ON THE OTHER HAND THERE??S A REASON WHY MOST CURRENT CANDIDATES ARE DEAD EVEN WITH HER IN HYPOTHETICAL MATCHUPS. AND IT??S NOT BECAUSE THE GOP IS INSUFFICIENTLY HATEFUL TOWARD GAYS SYRIAN REFUGEES AND EBOLA PATIENTS. THE 15 PERCENT??OR MORE??OF THE ELECTORATE THAT RELIABLY TRENDS LIBERTARIAN AND HAVE SHOWN A WILLINGNESS TO VOTE REPUBLICAN IN THE PAST ARE OUT THERE BUT IT WON??T VOTE GOP UNLESS THEY BELIEVE THE PARTY IS SERIOUS NOT ABOUT PRAYING AND MAKING SAND GLOW BUT ABOUT REDUCING THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF GOVERNMENT. THAT MAY BE TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR EVEN AND ESPECIALLY FROM A CANDIDATE AND PARTY THAT IS CONSTANTLY TALKING ABOUT SMALLER GOVERNMENT. BUT IT??S HARD TO SEE MANY LIBERTARIANS PULLING THE LEVER FOR ANYBODY WHO ONLY TALKS THE TALK. ,16634.0

FACES WHILE THEY??RE STILL ALIVE. OTHER GO-TO MOVES OUT OF THE CARTEL PLAYBOOK INCLUDE USING CHAINSAWS AND OTHER POWER TOOLS AS TORTURE DEVICES ISIS-STYLE BEHEADINGS AND DISSOLVING PEOPLE IN VATS OF ACID. MANY EXPERTS BELIEVE THE INCREASED VIOLENCE IN PLACES LIKE TIERRA CALIENTE IS INDICATIVE OF THE FAILURE OF THE DEA-SPONSORED ??KINGPIN STRATEGY? WHICH EMPHASIZES HUNTING DOWN HIGH-RANKING CARTEL LEADERS AS OPPOSED TO STRESSING INTERDICTION EFFORTS. ONCE A GIVEN CRIME LORD IS TAKEN DOWN CRITICS SAY IT ALMOST ALWAYS TOUCHES OFF A BATTLE AMONG HIS SECONDS AND LIEUTENANTS AS THEY SEEK TO TAKE OVER AND GAIN POWER FOR THEMSELVES. ??WHEN A CARTEL DIVIDES AND FORMS NEW GROUPS??WELL THOSE NEW GROUPS NEED TO FIND SOURCES OF INCOME? SAYS MAYRA JIM??NEZ AN INDEPENDENT MEXICAN JOURNALIST WHO HAS COVERED THE TIERRA CALIENTE REGION FOR MORE THAN A DECADE. ??THAT DRIVES THEM TO TAKE OVER NEW PLAZAS AND TO EXTORT AND KIDNAP PEOPLE IN THEM.? FOR EXAMPLE SOME OF THE MOST POWERFUL CARTELS IN GUERRERO??INCLUDING THE ROJOS AND THE GUERREROS UNIDOS??ARE SPLINTERS OF THE BELTRAN-LEYVA?ŸORGANIZATION WHICH THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT TOOK DOWN IN 2011.

TURF WARS HAVE BECOME MORE VIOLENT AS EACH GROUP SEEKS TO SEND A MESSAGE ABOUT ??WHO??S THE TOUGHEST DOG ON THE BLOCK? SAYS AMERICA??S PROGRAM DIRECTOR CARLSEN WHO JUST RETURNED FROM A RESEARCH TRIP TO TIERRA CALIENTE.

321,9738095.0,2016-01-08T05:02:00+00:00,THE GOLDEN GLOBES ARE MORE THAN THE OSCARS?? DRUNK CORRUPT COUSIN,WITH ITS FREE-FLOWING CHAMPAGNE NONSENSICAL NOMINATIONS AND WINNERS THAT MIGHT HAVE VOTERS WAKING UP MONDAY MORNING WITH HANGOVERS OF REGRET IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE THAT THE PREVAILING ATTITUDE ABOUT THE HOLLYWOOD FOREIGN PRESS ASSOCIATION??S ANNUAL STAR-STUDDED AWARDS CEREMONY IS: GO HOME?ŸGOLDEN GLOBES YOU??RE DRUNK. THIS IS AFTER ALL THE AWARDS ORGANIZATION THAT GAVE THREE NOMINATIONS TO THE GHASTLY ANGELINA JOLIE-JOHNNY DEPP FILM?ŸTHE TOURIST??PRESUMABLY FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DROOL OVER THE STATUESQUE SEX GODS??AND THE SAME YEAR RULED THE BORDERLINE UNWATCHABLE GAY MAN??S FEVER DREAM?ŸBURLESQUE A CONTENDER FOR BEST PICTURE. IT??S THE ORGANIZATION THAT IS STILL HAUNTED BY THE?Ÿ1982 BRIBERY CONTROVERSY IN WHICH ACTRESS PIA ZADORA WON THE AWARD FOR NEW STAR OF THE YEAR AFTER HER HUSBAND REPORTEDLY BOUGHT VOTERS OFF. THAT NOMINATED GLENN CLOSE FOR BEST ACTRESS FOR 101 DALMATIONS GAVE RENEE ZELLWEGER A TROPHY FOR HER PERFORMANCE IN NURSE BETTY AND CONSIDERED JENNIFER LOVE HEWITT AWARD-WORTHY FOR HER WORK IN LIFETIME??S THE CLIENT LIST. THAT HOSTED THE ORIGINAL ENVELOPE-READING FAIL LONG BEFORE STEVE HARVEY HEARD OF THE PHILLIPPIANS OR COLUMBIA: ELIZABETH TAYLOR??S BATTY BLEATING OF ??GLAAAAAADIATOR!? BEFORE HAVING READ ANY OF THE NOMINEES. THAT GAVE MADONNA TWO GOLDEN GLOBES INCLUDING ONE FOR ACTING. THE GOLDEN GLOBES IS YOUR FRIEND KAREN DRINKING FROM STRANGERS?? GLASSES AFTER TOO MANY MIMOSAS AT DRUNK BRUNCH. WHICH IS TO SAY THAT GOLDEN GLOBES MIGHT BE THE BEST OF ALL THE AWARD SHOWS. THOUGH KOOKY PUZZLING NONSENSICAL INFURIATING AND AT LEAST IN THAT 1982 CASE CORRUPT THE GOLDEN GLOBES IS ROUTINELY THE MOST ENTERTAINING AWARD SHOW OF THE YEAR AND IN TERMS OF REWARDING FILM AND TELEVISION THE ONE WITH THE BEST PULSE ON CURRENT EDGY FARE. (ALTHOUGH THAT PULSE CAN BE WORRISOMELY ERRATIC.) IT??S EASY TO LAUGH FOR EXAMPLE WHEN THE GOLDEN GLOBES NOMINATE THE SHORT-LIVED KELSEY GRAMMER DRAMA BOSS IN A YEAR WHEN IT SNUBS BREAKING BAD OR TO STARE QUIZZICALLY AT THIS YEAR??S BEST TV COMEDY LIST: MOZART IN THE JUNGLE? AND THE GLOBES?? FILM NOMINATIONS CAN VEER ON LUNACY DRAWING THE IRE OF EVEN CASUAL CINEPHILES. BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT THE GLOBES HAVE AN EXCELLENT TRACK-RECORD AS KINGMAKER IN THE TV CATEGORIES SINGLING OUT SERIES ON THE CREST OF BECOMING BUZZWORTHY THAT ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE EMMY AWARDS ROUTINELY IGNORE. AND IN THE WORLD OF FILM THE GLOBES CAN OFTEN BE THE COOLER MORE POPULIST ANSWER TO AN ACADEMY AWARDS BODY THAT NOTORIOUSLY SCOFFS AT GENRE FARE AND HAS HISTORICALLY FAVORED LITTLE-SEEN INDIES OVER WELL-MADE MONEY-MAKING MOVIES WE??VE ALL SEEN AND LOVED. LET??S LOOK AT THE TV SIDE FOR STARTERS. ROSEANNE ARGUABLY ONE OF THE GREATEST FAMILY SITCOMS IN TV HISTORY WON THE GOLDEN GLOBE FOR BEST COMEDY IN 1994. THE EMMYS NEVER NOMINATED IT IN THAT CATEGORY. NOT ONCE! THE X-FILES GREY??S ANATOMY SIX FEET UNDER CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM THE U.K. THE OFFICE NIP/TUCK AND GIRLS ALL WON THE TOP PRIZE AT THE GLOBES BUT NEVER REPEATED AT THE EMMYS WHICH WERE BUSY GIVING ROUGHLY A MILLION TROPHIES TO THE WEST WING FRASIER AND MODERN FAMILY. STEVE CARELL JENNIFER GARNER AMY POEHLER AND HUGH LAURIE ALL HAVE GOLDEN GLOBES FOR ICONIC PERFORMANCES ON THE OFFICE ALIAS PARKS AND RECREATION AND HOUSE RESPECTIVELY THAT NEVER EARNED THEM EMMYS. KERI RUSSELL AND KATEY SAGAL HAVE GLOBES FOR FELICITY AND SONS OF ANARCHY??BUT NOT EVEN EMMY NOMINATIONS FOR THOSE PERFORMANCES. MAYBE HELEN HUNT DESERVED HER FOUR CONSECUTIVE EMMY AWARDS FOR MAD ABOUT YOU AND MAYBE THERE??S A CASE FOR CANDICE BERGEN NEEDING FIVE EMMYS IN SEVEN YEARS FOR MURPHY BROWN. BUT WHILE THE EMMYS WERE RUBBER-STAMPING THEIR WINS YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT THE LIKES OF KIRSTIE ALLEY (CHEERS) ROSEANNE BARR (ROSEANNE) CYBILL SHEPARD (CYBILL) JENNA ELFMAN (DHARMA AND GREG) AND CALISTA FLOCKHART (ALLY MCBEAL) WERE TAKING TURNS AT THE GLOBES PODIUM. GOLDEN GLOBE NOMINATIONS ALONE CAN BE ENOUGH TO SIGNAL THAT AN UNDER-THE-RADAR SHOW IS WORTH SAMPLING BUT A WIN CAN TAKE THAT SHOW TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL. YOU SAW THAT LAST YEAR WHEN A WIN FOR?ŸTRANSPARENT LEGITIMIZED FOR MAINSTREAM AMERICA WHAT HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN A CRITICAL DARLING. AND WHEN THE RESPLENDENT GINA RODRIGUEZ TEARFULLY ACCEPTED HER TROPHY FOR JANE THE VIRGIN AND OFFERED A SPEECH OVERFLOWING WITH JOY AND EMOTION IT MIRRORED THOSE VERY ASPECTS OF JANE AND WON OVER VIEWERS WHO WERE MAYBE HESITANT TO GIVE IT A TRY. A WIN THIS YEAR FOR AN UNDERRATED SERIES LIKE CASUAL OR A CABLE SERIES LIKE OUTLANDER OR MR. ROBOT??TWO SHOWS PAVING THE WAY FOR THE FUTURE OF THE PRESTIGE DRAMA??COULD HAVE THE SAME EFFECT. PLUS THE GOLDEN GLOBES NOMINATED SARAH MICHELLE GELLAR FOR BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER WHEN THE EMMYS NEVER DID SO THAT??S THE ONLY THING THAT SHOULD NEED TO BE SAID ABOUT ITS TASTE LEVEL. ?Ÿ THE ORGANIZATION HAS SERVED A SIMILAR FUNCTION AS HOLLYWOOD KINGMAKER ON THE FILM SIDE TOO. IT EVEN USED TO HAVE A NEW STAR OF THE YEAR AWARD (THE ONE PIA ZADORA CONTROVERSIALLY TOOK HOME) TO CEMENT IT. THAT TROPHY IS NOW DEFUNCT BUT THE ORGANIZATION STILL HAS THE SAME POWER. FOR ALL THE EYE-ROLLING OVER THE TENDENCY OF THE HFPA TO ENGAGE IN THE CRUDELY NAMED PRACTICE OF STARFUCKING??BEING SEDUCED INTO NOMINATING MOVIES AND ACTORS JUST BECAUSE THEY??RE SUPER DUPER FAMOUS??THERE??S A LESS POPULAR ARGUMENT TO BE MADE IN DEFENSE OF THIS PRACTICE PARTICULARLY WHEN IT??S USED TO CATAPULT RISING TALENT TO THE A-LIST. IT MADE A STAR OUT OF HUGH JACKMAN WHO MADE HIS FIRST BIG HOLLYWOOD SPLASH AFTER HIS SURPRISE NOMINATION IN THE SLIGHT THOUGH CHARMING ROMANTIC COMEDY KATE AND LEOPOLD. A NOMINATION FOR JENNIFER LOPEZ FOR SELENA IS ANOTHER GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS. EMILY BLUNT WAS A GOLDEN GLOBE WINNER LONG BEFORE ASCENDING THE HOLLYWOOD RANKS AND SCARLETT JOHANSSON WAS A FOUR-TIME NOMINATED GLOBES DARLING BEFORE BECOMING A MAJOR HOLLYWOOD PLAYER HERSELF. ?ŸA NOMINATION FOR EMMA STONE FOR EASY A SKYROCKETED HER CAREER. OCCASIONALLY TOO THE GLOBES SERVE AS A CORRECTIVE FOR PERFORMANCES AND FILMS THE MORE TRADITIONAL AND PREDICTABLE ACADEMY AWARDS ISN??T ADVENTUROUS ENOUGH TO REWARD. JIM CARREY FOR EXAMPLE EARNED A MUCH-DESERVED GOLDEN GLOBE FOR ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND BEFORE BEING SNUBBED BY OSCAR. IN RECENT YEARS JAKE GYLLENHAAL (NIGHTCRAWLER) ROBERT REDFORD (ALL IS LOST) MICHAEL FASSBENDER (SHAME) AND RYAN GOSLING (BLUE VALENTINE) ALL EARNED GLOBE NOMINATIONS FOR OSCAR-WORTHY PERFORMANCES IGNORED BY OSCAR. SALLY HAWKINS WON A GLOBE FOR HAPPY-GO-LUCKY BEFORE BEING CRUELLY OVERLOOKED FOR EVEN A NOMINATION AT THE OSCARS. GRETA GERWIG (FRANCES HA) JULY DELPY (BEFORE MIDNIGHT) AND JULIA LOUIS-DREYFUS (ENOUGH SAID) WERE ALL GLOBE NOMINEES IN 2013 FOR THRILLING PERFORMANCES THAT DIDN??T MAKE THE OSCAR CUT. GLOBE NOMINEES RACHEL WEISZ AND TILDA SWINTON GAVE ARGUABLY THE BEST PERFORMANCES IN 2012 AND 2011 FOR DEEP BLUE SEA AND WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN RESPECTIVELY BUT CAME UP EMPTY AS ACADEMY AWARD CONTENDERS. THE BEST COMEDY OR MUSICAL CATEGORY SPECIFICALLY HAS BEEN A HAVEN FOR MOVIES AND THEIR ACTORS WHO ARE OFTEN IGNORED BY THE ACADEMY DUE TO ITS HISTORICAL BIAS AGAINST COMEDY: BACK TO THE FUTURE INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS BORAT THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS HEDWIG AND THE ANGRY INCH WHEN HARRY MET SALLY LEGALLY BLONDE HOME ALONE BRIDESMAIDS THE HANGOVER AND GHOSTBUSTERS. SPY AND TRAINWRECK TWO OF THE BEST REVIEWED AND MOST ENTERTAINING FILMS OF 2015 ARE NOMINATED FOR BEST PICTURE AT THE GLOBES. DOES A GOLDEN GLOBE NOD VALIDATE EITHER OF THESE FILMS MORE THAN THEIR BOX OFFICE TOTALS OR GLOWING REVIEWS? (DID NODS FOR SISTER ACT MY BEST FRIEND??S WEDDING OR AIRPLANE! FOR THAT MATTER?) NO. BUT IT??S NICE WHEN MOVIES THAT AUDIENCES ACTUALLY SAW AND LIKED COULD BE CONSIDERED AWARD-WORTHY. ?Ÿ PLUS THERE??S A FAIR ARGUMENT THAT THE MOVIES LISTED ABOVE HAVE HAD AS MUCH OF AN IMPACT ON CINEMA??WHETHER CHANGING THE FACE OF COMEDY IN THE MOVIES OR PUSHING FORWARD TASTE LEVELS??AS ANY OF THE HO-HUM BEST PICTURE ACADEMY AWARD NOMINEES THAT HAVE BEEN RIDICULED AS HINDSIGHT SHARPENS TO 20/20: CHOCOLAT FINDING NEVERLAND AND CRASH. FOR NOW THOUGH LET??S STOP OURSELVES BEFORE WE PUT TOO MUCH CARE AND THOUGHT INTO THE HONORING OF RICH AND FAMOUS CELEBRITIES WHO ARE ALREADY RECEIVING HONORS EVERY TIME SOMEONE SNEEZES. AT THE VERY LEAST THE GOLDEN GLOBES DESERVES TO BE DEFENDED AS THREE-PLUS HOURS OF TELEVISED ENTERTAINMENT. ESPECIALLY SINCE CASTING THE LIKES OF RICKY GERVAIS TINA FEY AND AMY POEHLER AS HOSTS THE GOLDEN GLOBES HAS BEEN THE MOST FUN OF AWARDS TELECASTS IN THE LONG SLOG OF OSCAR SEASON. THE IRREVERENCE AND BITING WIT OF THE STARS IS PARTIALLY TO THANK BUT SO IS THE GLOBES?? REPUTATION AS THE CEREMONY TO NOT TAKE ALL THAT SERIOUSLY. THEY CAN TAKE THE PISS OUT OF THE STARS BECAUSE THE STARS ARE GETTING PISS-DRUNK THEMSELVES UNLIKE AT THE STUFFIER OSCARS THAT MERITS MORE DECORUM AND POLITENESS. THE SPEECHES ARE MORE ENTERTAINING BECAUSE THE WINNERS ARE EITHER TIPSY OR EVEN BETTER OVERCOME WITH EMOTION IN STAR-IS-BORN MOMENTS LIKE LAST YEAR WITH GINA RODRIGUEZ. SO GO HOME GOLDEN GLOBES YOU??RE DRUNK? MORE LIKE SHOTS FOR EVERYONE GLOBES! HERE??S TO ANOTHER ROUND. ,30036.0

BUT THIS YEAR A RULE-TWEAK FROM THE LAST ELECTION CYCLE INTENDED TO BOOST THE REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT JUST MIGHT BACKFIRE ON THEM AND END UP HELPING SOMEONE MANY SEE AS REPUBLICAN ENEMY #1: DONALD TRUMP. IT STARTED IN 2012 WHEN ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS CHANGED A RULE TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR INSURGENT CANDIDATES (LIKE THEN-REP. RON PAUL) TO CHALLENGE A PRESUMPTIVE GOP NOMINEE (SEE: MITT ROMNEY) ON THE CONVENTION FLOOR. THE NEW RULE REQUIRED A NOMINEE TO WIN OUTRIGHT IN AT LEAST EIGHT STATES??UP FROM FIVE STATES??TO BE NOMINATED AT THE CONVENTION. WHILE THE RULE GIVES THE FRONTRUNNER A BIG ADVANTAGE IT??S SAFE TO SAY THE RNC ESTABLISHMENT DIDN??T HAVE DONALD TRUMP OR TED CRUZ IN MIND WHEN IT WAS CRAFTED. THIS YEAR REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT CANDIDATES ARE FINDING THEMSELVES IN A SITUATION THAT FEELS A LOT LIKE RON PAUL??S IN 2012??CANDIDATES LIKE CHRIS CHRISTIE MARCO RUBIO AND JEB BUSH MARGINALIZED UNDERDOGS HOPING TO USE OBSCURE RULES TO GET TRACTION ON THE CONVENTION FLOOR IF THINGS GET CRAZY. BECAUSE THEIR ESTABLISHMENT ALLIES RAISED THE BAR FOR BEING NOMINATED IN 2012 THINGS COULD BE A LITTLE TRICKIER FOR THEM IF THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION GOES OFF THE RAILS THIS SUMMER AND THE PARTY PICKS ITS NOMINEE AT A FLOOR BATTLE. AND THAT HAS DIANA ORROCK EXCITED. ORROCK THE REPUBLICAN COMMITTEEWOMAN FROM NEVADA IS ONE OF TRUMP??S ONLY AVOWED ALLIES IN THE RNC. ??I LIKE A LOT OF WHAT MR.

THOUGH IN 2012 REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT VOTERS COALESCED BEHIND ROMNEY WHILE GRASSROOTS VOTERS FAILED TO TEAM UP WITH ONE OR TWO FAVORITE CANDIDATES. SO THE HIGH THRESHOLD LESSENED THEIR CLOUT. HOWEVER THIS YEAR REPRESENTS A NEAR-PERFECT INVERSION OF THAT WITH ESTABLISHMENT VOTERS SCRAMBLING TO PICK A FAVORITE FROM A HOST OF LIKABLE CANDIDATES BUT GRASSROOTS VOTERS MOSTLY SETTLED BEHIND TRUMP AND TED CRUZ.

ON TUESDAY IN THE EAST ROOM OF THE WHITE HOUSE OBAMA WILL UNVEIL A SERIES OF ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN GUN LAWS AND GUN SAFETY--AND INFURIATE HIS CRITICS. WHY DIDN??T HE DO IT SOONER? THAT QUESTION WAS POSED TO ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS IN A CALL WITH REPORTERS AND THE ANSWER COULD BE SUMMED UP IN A PHRASE OBAMA OFTEN USES: ENOUGH IS ENOUGH -- AND TIME IS RUNNING OUT ON HIS WATCH. THE CENTRAL ELEMENT OF HIS EXECUTIVE ACTIONS IS SHRINKING WHAT IS COMMONLY CALLED THE ??GUN SHOW LOOPHOLE.? GUN DEALERS WHO SELL OVER THE INTERNET OR HAVE A BOOTH AT A GUN SHOW OR FLEA MARKET WHERE THEY SELL FIREARMS FOR PROFIT WILL NOT LONGER BE EXEMPT FROM CONDUCTING BACKGROUND CHECKS ON BUYERS. THE EXEMPTION FOR HOBBYISTS AND COLLECTORS WILL STILL REMAIN THOUGH. ??JUST BECAUSE YOU SHOP FOR GUNS WITH A MOUSE AND NOT WITH YOUR FEET YOU CAN??T ESCAPE BACKGROUND CHECKS? VALERIE JARRETT A SENIOR ADVISER TOLD REPORTERS. ANOTHER RELATIVELY NEW ??TRUST LOOPHOLE? WILL ALSO BE CLOSED WHERE GUNS ARE ACQUIRED THROUGH A CORPORATION OR TRUST OR SOME OTHER LEGAL ENTITY. IN 2000 THERE WERE FEWER THAN 900 REQUESTS FOR THESE PURCHASES TWO YEARS AGO THE NUMBER WAS 90000 ACCORDING TO ATTORNEY GENERAL LORETTA LYNCH. LYNCH SPOKE TO THE RAPIDLY CHANGING MARKETPLACE FOR GUNS TELLING REPORTERS IT SHOULD BE CALLED THE ??INTERNET LOOPHOLE? THAT GUN SHOWS PALE NEXT TO GUNS BOUGHT AND SOLD ON THE WEB. ??GUN SALES ARE MOVING ONLINE NOT ONLY TO CONSUMERS BUT TO THE DARK WEB WHERE ILLICIT ACTIVITY TAKES PLACE? SHE SAID. DAN GROSS WITH THE BRADY CAMPAIGN PRAISED THE EXPANSION OF BACKGROUND CHECKS THAT THE LATE JAMES BRADY AND HIS WIFE SARAH CHAMPIONED AFTER HE WAS GRIEVOUSLY WOUNDED DURING THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON PRESIDENT REAGAN. \BRADY BACKGROUND CHECKS HAVE BLOCKED MORE THAN 2.4 MILLION GUN SALES TO PROHIBITED PURCHASERS SAVING COUNTLESS LIVES. THE PROBLEM IS EVERY DAY THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF COMMERCIAL SALES WHERE BACKGROUND CHECKS ARE NOT REQUIRED. THANKS TO THE PRESIDENT??S HISTORIC ACTION TODAY THAT WILL NO LONGER BE THE CASE? GROSS SAID IN A STATEMENT. AMONG THE OTHER STEPS OBAMA WILL ANNOUNCE AND THAT HIS AIDES DETAILED TO REPORTERS INCLUDE MODERNIZING THE NATIONAL INSTANT CHECK SYSTEM (NICS) WHICH LYNCH SAID RECEIVES 63000 REQUESTS EVERY DAY REQUIRING PHONE CALLS. INSTEAD IT WILL BECOME AN AUTOMATED 24/7 SYSTEM. CURRENTLY IF A GUN DEALER DOESN??T GET A RESPONSE BACK WITHIN THREE DAYS THE SALE CAN BE MADE. DYLANN ROOF THE SHOOTER WHO ATTACKED A BLACK CHURCH IN CHARLESTON SOUTH CAROLINA LAST YEAR WOULD HAVE BEEN STOPPED FROM PURCHASING HIS GUN IF THE SYSTEM HAD BEEN MORE EFFICIENT. EVEN SO LYNCH WAS RELUCTANT TO CUSTOMIZE ANY OF THE PRESIDENT??S ACTIONS TO ANY PARTICULAR CASE. OFFICIALS REPEATED WHAT OBAMA OFTEN SAYS THAT NO ONE LAW OR EXECUTIVE ORDER COULD STOP ALL GUN VIOLENCE. ??FRANKLY IF IT DOES STOP ONE ACT OF VIOLENCE IT IS WORTH IT? SAID LYNCH. IN THE FACT SHEET DISTRIBUTED BY THE WHITE HOUSE THERE ARE NUMEROUS REFERENCES TO THE BUREAU OF ALCOHOL TOBACCO FIREARMS AND EXPLOSIVES (ATF) REFINING ITS RULES AND STEPPING UP ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAWS. OBAMA IS REQUESTING FUNDING TO HIRE 200 NEW ATF AGENTS IN HIS BUDGET TO CONGRESS ALONG WITH $500 MILLION TO INCREASE ACCESS TO MENTAL-HEALTH TREATMENT. THERE IS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR ADDRESSING MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS BUT CONGRESS HAS A LONG HISTORY OF STARVING THE ATF OF RESOURCES AND THERE IS LITTLE LIKELIHOOD THE REPUBLICAN-LED HOUSE WILL APPROVE FUNDING MORE ATF AGENTS. WITH THE REVELATION THAT GUNS NOW KILL MORE AMERICANS THAN CAR ACCIDENTS THERE IS A NEW URGENCY TO THE ISSUE OF GUN VIOLENCE. YET ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS WERE UNABLE TO SAY HOW MANY GUN DEALERS MIGHT BE BROUGHT INTO COMPLIANCE WITH BACKGROUND CHECKS UNDER OBAMA??S NEW EXECUTIVE ORDER. RECORD KEEPING AROUND GUNS IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE IN PART BECAUSE THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION HAS KEPT IT THAT WAY. PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL UNDERSCORE WHEN HE SPEAKS FROM THE EAST ROOM THAT HE HIS TAKING ??COMMONSENSE? ACTIONS THAT ARE BACKED BY A STRONG MAJORITY OF AMERICANS. EVEN REPUBLICAN SUPPORT IS ??NORTH OF 75 PERCENT? SAID PRESS SECRETARY JOSH ERNEST. A COMMON REFRAIN FROM OBAMA??S CRITICS IS THAT NONE OF THE ACTIONS THAT HE IS INTRODUCING WOULD HAVE PREVENTED ANY OF THE INDIVIDUAL ACTS OF CARNAGE THAT PERIODICALLY DOMINATE THE HEADLINES. THAT MAY BE TRUE BUT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS CRAFTED A SET OF GUIDELINES AND REGULATIONS THAT TOGETHER COULD HAVE AN AFFECT BUT THAT SHOULD IN NO WAY ABSOLVE CONGRESS FROM ACTING. OBAMA WON??T BE LETTING CONGRESS OFF THE HOOK AND IN AN ELECTION YEAR THAT??S GOOD POLITICS AND IN THE CASE OF GUNS GOOD POLICY TOO. BEFORE THE HOLIDAYS CONGRESS VOTED AGAINST CLOSING A LOOPHOLE THAT ALLOWS SOMEONE ON THE NO-FLY LIST TO LEGALLY PURCHASE A FIREARM. OBAMA HAS FOUND HIS VOICE ON THIS ISSUE AND HE IS READY TO TAKE HIS CASE TO THE PUBLIC BELIEVING THE COUNTRY IS WITH HIM AND READY TO TURN THE CORNER ON GUN VIOLENCE.?Ÿ ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. """,18799.0

WHILE BARTON MAY BE NEW TO SUPER PACS HE IS NOT AT ALL NEW TO POLITICS. THE FORMER CHRISTIAN SCHOOL PRINCIPAL AND ORDAINED MINISTER WAS ALSO THE VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE TEXAS GOP FOR NEARLY 10 YEARS.

WHO ARE ALSO DEVOTEES OF THE RIGHT-LEANING ASSEMBLY OF YAHWEH 7TH DAY CHURCH. BARTON??S OWN POLITICS ARE CONSERVATIVE AND AS HE DESCRIBES THEM ??BIBLE CENTERED.? HE IS STAUNCHLY ANTI-ABORTION ANTI-GAY MARRIAGE PRO-SECOND AMENDMENT AND PRO-FREE MARKET. HE HAS SPOKEN EXTENSIVELY ABOUT HIS BELIEF THAT THAT JESUS WAS AGAINST CAPITAL GAINS TAXES THE ESTATE TAX AND THE MINIMUM WAGE. HE HAS CALLED PRESIDENT OBAMA ??THE MOST BIBLICALLY HOSTILE PRESIDENT IN U.S. HISTORY? AND CALLS ON CHRISTIANS TO VOTE FOR AND ELECT ??RIGHTEOUS? LEADERS. BARTON??S INVOLVEMENT IN POLITICS IN THE PAST AND NOW IS A LOGICAL EXTENSION OF WALLBUILDERS THE ALEDO TEX. COMPANY HE FOUNDED WHOSE MISSION IS TO ENCOURAGE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO DEVELOP POLICIES THAT ??REFLECT BIBLICAL VALUES.? WALLBUILDERS ALSO CALLS ON CHRISTIANS TO INVOLVE THEMSELVES GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS AND CREATES DVDS AND BOOKS THAT FEATURE SOME OF THE THOUSANDS OF ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS FROM THE COUNTRY??S FOUNDING THAT BARTON HAS ACQUIRED WHICH HE POINTS TO AS PROOF THAT THE UNITED STATES WAS FOUNDED EXPLICITLY AS A CHRISTIAN NATION. AS MUCH AS BARTON??S WRITINGS HAVE DRAWN FANS AMONG THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT HIS WORK HAS RECEIVED EQUALLY EXTENSIVE CRITICISM FROM SCHOLARS AND HISTORIANS THAT CALL HIS WORK DEEPLY FLAWED AND CHEERY PICKED HISTORY. ??DAVID BARTON HAS REPEATEDLY SAID THAT PORTIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION ARE TAKEN VERBATIM FROM THE BIBLE WHICH IS LUDICROUS AND EASILY DISPROVED? SAID PETER MONTGOMERY A SENIOR FELLOW WITH PEOPLE FOR THE AMERICAN WAY THE PROGRESSIVE INTEREST GROUP THAT HAS DEVOTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO FOLLOWING BARTON AND DEBUNKING HIS WORK. ??HE SAYS THAT CONSTITUTION AND THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE CAME OUT OF PREACHERS?? SERMONS SO THAT WE SHOULD LOOK AT THEM AS CHRISTIAN DOCUMENTS EVEN THOUGH THE CONSTITUTION EXPLICITLY IS NOT THAT AND WAS CHOSEN TO NOT BE THAT.? BUT NOT ALL OF THE CRITICISM OF BARTON??S WORK COMES FROM THE LEFT. HIS 2012 BOOK?ŸTHE JEFFERSON LIES EXPOSING THE MYTHS YOU'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED ABOUT THOMAS JEFFERSON WAS PULLED FROM BOOKSHELVES BY ITS CHRISTIAN PUBLISHER OVER MULTIPLE INACCURACIES AN EPISODE DISMISSED AS A SMEAR CAMPAIGN FROM ??LIBERAL BASTARDS? BY BARTON SUPPORTERS INCLUDING GLENN BECK WHO OFFERED TO RE-PUBLISH THE BOOK HIMSELF. THE CONTROVERSY APPEARS TO HAVE DONE NOTHING TO DIMINISH BARTON IN THE EYES OF HIS SUPPORTERS. ??YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER THE SOURCE? MIKE GONZALEZ SAID. ??WHO ARE YOU GOING TO BELIEVE? THE PERSON WHO OWNS ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS OR A PROFESSOR WHO HAS NONE OF THOSE AND IS JUST BASICALLY GOING OFF OF REVISED HISTORY? DAVID BARTON IS A WALKING HISTORY BOOK. HE IS A MAN OF INTEGRITY.? THAT KIND OF PERSONAL LOYALTY TO A LEADER AMONG EVANGELICALS IS INVALUABLE FOR ANY CAMPAIGN BUT IS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO CRUZ WHO HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE IS NOT LOOKING TO EXPAND HIS APPEAL BEYOND THE BASE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TO NEW VOTERS PARTICULARLY IF THEY??RE EVANGELICALS. TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS BARTON??S KTP PAC HOSTED A GATHERING OF 300 HIGH-PROFILE PASTORS IN CISCO TEX. LAST MONTH TO INTRODUCE FAITH LEADERS TO CRUZ. CONWAY??S KTP I HAS HIRED 14 FIELD STAFF IN SOUTH CAROLINA TEN IN IOWA AND STAFFERS IN MISSOURI OKLAHOMA KANSAS IN STATES IN SEVERAL THE SEC PRIMARY STATES. SHE HAS ALSO PLOWED CASH INTO PHONE BANKING DOOR KNOCKING DIGITAL AND SOCIAL OUTREACH IN EARLY STATES AND RECENTLY MADE A $1 MILLION AD BUY IN THE FOUR EARLY STATES. ??MY PHILOSOPHY IS THAT OUR RESOURCES ARE AMPLE BUT NOT UNLIMITED? SHE SAID. WHILE CONWAY??S AND BARTON??S SUPER PACS HAVE BEEN VISIBLY ACTIVE KTP II AND KTP III THE NAUGEBAUER AND WILKS?? SUPER PACS HAVE KEPT NEARLY EVERY PENNY OF THEIR ORIGINAL $25 MILLION HAULS DORMANT LIKE TWO LOADED GUNS JUST WAITING TO FIRE. THIS SITUATION HAS CAUSED HEARTBURN FOR CRUZ STAFFERS AND ASSOCIATES WHO HAVE NO SAY??AND NO IDEA??ABOUT WHEN HOW OR EVEN IF THE MONEY WILL BE SPENT. CONWAY SAID THAT THE FOUR SUPER PACS ARE ??AFFILIATED SO THAT WE WON??T DUPLICATE EFFORTS.? THEY COORDINATE STRATEGY AND MESSAGING BUT ULTIMATELY THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS FOR EACH PAC LIES WITHIN THE PAC ITSELF. THE PATH THE SUPER PACS SETTLE ON COULD MAKE THE DIFFERENCE FOR CRUZ WHOSE MOMENTUM HAS STALLED IN THE POLLS BUT IS A CLEAR SECOND TO DONALD TRUMP IN IOWA AND SOUTH CAROLINA AND ACROSS THE REST OF THE SOUTH WHICH WILL VOTE AS A BLOCK IN THE ??SEC PRIMARY? ON MARCH 1.

THEY HAD BEEN WEARING LONG BLACK LEATHER COATS AND HAD NOT ESCAPED THE NOTICE OF TWO COPS IN A RADIO CAR. ??WHAT DID BOB DYLAN CALL IT? WE LOOKED SHADIER THAN A LADY WITH A MOUSTACHE? VICKERS TOLD THE FIRST INFORMANT. VICKERS SAID HE AND HIS COMRADES BECAME WORRIED WHEN THE COPS ORDERED THEM INTO A NARROW TENEMENT HALLWAY RATHER THAN JUST STOPPING AND FRISKING THEM IN THE STREET. WHITE BEGAN TO TUSSLE WITH THE COPS AND SHOOTING ERUPTED. ONE OF THE COPS OFFICER ANTHONY PLATE WAS SHOT IN THE FACE. ??KNOCKED HIS EYE OUT? VICKERS RECALLED TO THE SECOND INFORMANT. THE OTHER COP SGT. HOWARD STEWARD WAS SHOT IN THE LEG. WHITE WAS SHOT FOUR TIMES IN THE CHEST RUSSELL ONCE IN THE LEFT BUTTOCK. VICKERS WAS HIT TWO TIMES IN THE UPPER BODY. HE REMEMBERED THAT THE HALLWAY WAS CHOKED WITH GUN SMOKE AS HE STEPPED INTO THE STREET. ??OH GOD IT WAS TERRIBLE. I WOULD NEVER EVER WANT TO GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN? VICKERS TOLD THE SECOND INFORMANT. ??I HAD COTTON IN MY MOUTH. I WAS SCARED BUT IT WAS TOO LATE TO BE SCARED. I WAS IN ANOTHER WORLD. IT WAS ROBOT-LIKE ROBOTIC. I CAN??T DESCRIBE THE WORLD I WAS IN. I COULD NEVER DESCRIBE IT. I THINK ABOUT THAT SOMETIMES.? VICKERS RECOUNTED SEEING FIGURES APPROACHING. ??I SAW THE POLICE COMING BACKUP? HE RECALLED. HE RESISTED AN URGE TO FLEE. HE DECIDED TO CHARGE STRAIGHT AT THE ONCOMING COPS INSTEAD. ??I SAID ??I??LL TAKE THE FIGHT TO THEM??? HE RECALLED. HE SOUNDED STILL STUNNED AS HE RECOUNTED WHAT HAPPENED NEXT. ??WHEN I WENT TO GO TOWARD THEM THEY WENT RIGHT BY ME? HE REMEMBERED. ??I SAID ??OH SHIT.??? HE CONTINUED ON TO THE CORNER AND STOPPED A TAXICAB. ??I GOT IN PULLED A GUN ON HIM? VICKERS REMEMBERED. ??I SAID ??DRIVE!??? THE CABBIE DID AS INSTRUCTED UNTIL VICKERS TOLD HIM TO PULL OVER. VICKERS SLIPPED THROUGH AN ALLEYWAY AND CAUGHT ANOTHER TAXI. ??I PAID FOR IT? HE REPORTED. HE HAD THIS CAB DROP HIM BY A PHONE BOOTH. ??I MADE A CALL? HE REMEMBERED. ??THEY TOLD ME TO GO TO FORDHAM UNIVERSITY.? HE SAID THAT TWO CO-EDS HID HIM IN A WOMEN??S DORM FOR TWO DAYS. A COMRADE THEN PICKED HIM UP AND DROVE HIM TO A SAFE HOUSE IN THE BRONX. ??I WAS HIT REAL BAD I WAS SHOT? HE TOLD THE FIRST INFORMANT. HE REPORTED THAT HIS COMRADES SNUCK HIM INTO THE SAME HOSPITAL WHERE THE TWO SHOT COPS HAD BEEN TAKEN. BOTH COPS HAD SURVIVED INCLUDING THE ONE WHO HAD BEEN HIT IN THE FACE. WHITE HAD ALSO SURVIVED DESPITE THE FOUR WOUNDS TO HIS CHEST. RUSSELL HAD SUCCUMBED TO THE SINGLE WOUND TO THE BUTTOCK THE BULLET HAVING RICOCHETED OFF A BONE AND TORN INTO HIS SPLEEN. ??WHEN YOUR TIME??S UP YOUR TIME??S UP? VICKERS TOLD THE FIRST INFORMANT. VICKERS GOT X-RAYS BUT STILL HAD A BULLET IN HIM WHEN HE WAS SPIRITED OUT OF THE HOSPITAL AVOIDING A SHOOTOUT THAT NO DOUBT WOULD HAVE ERUPTED HAD THE POLICE DISCOVERED HIM. ??WE HAD MACHINEGUNS GRENADES? VICKERS RECALLED. ??WE SAID ??LORD IT??S A GOOD THING THEY NEVER NOTICED US BECAUSE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN ALL HELL IN THAT HOSPITAL.??? VICKERS FOUND REFUGE AT ANOTHER SAFE HOUSE. THE POLICE BULLET STILL IN HIM CONSTITUTED A THREAT NOT JUST TO HIS HEALTH BUT ALSO TO HIS FREEDOM AS EVIDENCE THAT HE HAD BEEN IN THE SHOOTOUT. ??JOANNE CHESIMARD SHE WORKED ON TAKING IT OUT? VICKERS REPORTED TO THE FIRST INFORMANT. VICKERS??S ACCOUNT SHIFTED TO THE NAME CHESIMARD ADOPTED AS SHE BECAME KNOWN AS THE SOUL OF THE BLACK LIBERATION ARMY. ??ASSATA SHAKUR SHE TOOK THE BULLET OUT? VICKERS SAID. VICKERS RECALLED CONVALESCING FOR A TIME IN NEW JERSEY AND CONTINUING ON TO PHILADELPHIA. ??THEN I WAS READY? VICKERS TOLD THE FIRST INFORMANT. ??WE STARTED SOME MORE SHIT.? POLICE BELIEVE THAT THIS INCLUDED THE ASSASSINATION OF FOSTER AND LAURIE WHO HAD SERVED TOGETHER WITH THE MARINES IN VIETNAM ONLY TO BE GUNNED DOWN IN THE STREETS OF NEW YORK. A DUFFLE BAG WAS FOUND AT THE MURDER SCENE CONTAINING A NUMBER OF ITEMS ONE A BOMB-MAKING MANUAL. ??WHEN THOSE COPS GOT KILLED DOWN IN THE VILLAGE MY FINGERPRINTS SHOWED UP ON SOME STUFF THAT WAS LAID BEHIND ON A COUPLE OF BOOKS? VICKERS TOLD THE SECOND INFORMANT. ??MY FINGERPRINTS SHOW UP ON A COUPLE OF BOOKS BUT THEY COULDN??T GET ME ON NOTHING.? A MONTH LATER VICKERS WAS ARRESTED FOR THE NON-FATAL SHOOTING OF A COP IN NEWARK N.J. THE FINGERPRINTS FROM THE SCENE OF THE DOUBLE ASSASSINATION IN NEW YORK PROVED ONLY THAT HE HAD HANDLED THE BOMB-MAKING MANUAL AT SOME TIME AND HE WAS NOT CHARGED. HE WAS INDICTED FOR THE EARLIER SHOOTOUT IN HARLEM IN WHICH TWO COPS WERE WOUNDED BUT A MISTRIAL WAS FOLLOWED BY THE ACQUITTAL THAT MADE EVEN VICKERS WONDER ABOUT THE JURORS. VICKERS??S LUCK ENDED WHEN HE WAS CONVICTED OF THE NEWARK SHOOTING. HE WAS SENTENCED TO 10 YEARS. ??I DID MY TIME? VICKERS SAID. MEANWHILE ASSATA SHAKUR WAS CONVICTED OF THE 1973 KILLING NEW JERSEY STATE TROOPER WERNER FOERSTER. SHE ESCAPED FROM PRISON IN 1979 AND WAS ON THE RUN FOR FIVE YEARS BEFORE SHE MANAGED TO REACH CUBA. THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT GRANTED HER ASYLUM IN 1984. BY THEN VICKERS HAD FINISHED HIS TERM AND MOVED TO UPSTATE NEW YORK. HE BEGAN USING DRUGS AND THEN STARTED SELLING THEM. THE POLICE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THEIR ASSASSINATED BROTHERS AND SENT TWO INFORMANTS HIS WAY IN SUCCESSION WITH THE HOPE OF MAKING A MURDER CASE AS WELL AS A DRUG CASE AGAINST VICKERS. BOTH INFORMANTS BROUGHT ALONG BOOKS ABOUT THE ERA WHEN THE BLA DECLARED WAR ON COPS. VICKERS REMINISCED AS THE INVESTIGATORS HOPED BUT HE STOPPED SHORT OF INCRIMINATING HIMSELF IN ANY KILLINGS. THE INVESTIGATORS HAD TO SETTLE FOR SIX COUNTS OF SELLING HEROIN. AT THE TRIAL LATE LAST YEAR THE EVIDENCE INCLUDED RECORDINGS IN WHICH VICKERS ADVISED AN INFORMANT ON THE BEST WAY TO KILL AS WELL AS HOW TO MAKE BOMBS AND SILENCERS. ??YOU CAN TAKE A POTATO A NICE IDAHO POTATO AND JUST STICK IT ON THERE AND THAT MAKES A GOOD SILENCER? VICKERS SUGGESTED. THE PROSECUTION ALSO PLAYED THE RECORDING IN WHICH VICKERS ASKED WHAT THAT LONG-AGO JURY HAD BEEN THINKING WHEN IT ACQUITTED HIM. THE PRESENT JURY MADE CLEAR WHAT IT WAS THINKING BY REPEATING THE SAME WORD SIX TIMES. ??GUILTY...GUILTY??GUILTY??GUILTY...GUILTY??GUILTY.? AT THE SENTENCING THE PROSECUTOR REMINDED THE JUDGE OF SOMETHING VICKERS HAD SAID IN THE RECORDINGS. ??IT??S EASY TO KILL SOMEONE? VICKERS HAD SAID. ??THE HARD PART IS GETTING AWAY WITH IT.? ONE PERSON WHO CONTINUES TO GET AWAY WITH IT IS SHAKUR. THE SO-CALLED NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS BETWEEN CUBA AND THE UNITED STATES CANNOT RIGHTLY BE CALLED ANYTHING CLOSE TO NORMAL AS LONG AS SHE CONTINUES TO ENJOY CUBAN REFUGE FROM AMERICAN JUSTICE. ,3970.0

SOMETIME IN THE NEXT YEAR A COMPANY CALLED BOYALIFE GENOMICS WILL OPEN A MASSIVE FACTORY IN THE COASTAL CHINESE CITY OF TIANJIN WHERE IT PLANS TO CLONE 100000 CATTLE PER YEAR??A WAY TO ADDRESS THE MIDDLE KINGDOM??S RISING APPETITE FOR BEEF. EVENTUALLY THE COMPANY AIMS TO CLONE 1 MILLION CATTLE A YEAR AS WELL AS OTHER ANIMALS LIKE CHAMPION RACEHORSES AND DRUG-SNIFFING DOGS. CLONED HUMANS??OR AS BOYALIFE??S FOUNDER XIAO-CHUN XU CALLS THEM ??FRANKENSTEINS???ARE NOT ON THE MENU. NOT YET. XU??S ULTRAMODERN FACTORY??ITS LAYOUT IS BIGGER THAN THREE FOOTBALL FIELDS??IS THE LATEST MANIFESTATION OF THE SCI-FI CLONING CRAZE THAT??S SEEN MEMBERS OF A FLORIDA NONPROFIT TRY TO CLONE A 2000-YEAR-OLD TREE AND A SOUTH KOREAN COMPANY CLONE TWO PUPPIES IN AN ATTEMPT TO REINCARNATE A BRITISH COUPLE??S BELOVED DEAD DOG. OF COURSE SCRAPING BARK FROM A TREE OR SENDING IN A VIAL OF YOUR DOG??S DNA IS FAR DIFFERENT FROM CHURNING OUT 100000 IDENTICAL CATTLE. THAT LEVEL OF EFFICIENCY AND SPEED IS UNPRECEDENTED AND XU HOPES IT WILL CHANGE THE FUTURE OF ANIMAL REPRODUCTION. THE CHINESE-BORN DOCTOR WITH A PHD FROM WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY AND AN MBA FROM EMORY IS PART NERDY SCIENTIST PART BUSINESSMAN WITH THAT RARE COMBINATION OF BRAINS AND STREET SMARTS. AFTER WORKING AS A PROJECT MANAGER AT PFIZER HE MOVED BACK TO CHINA WHERE IN 2009 HE FOUNDED A MASSIVE STEM-CELL DATABASE WITH THE HELP OF SEVEN RESEARCH INSTITUTES. THREE YEARS LATER XU FOUNDED BOYALIFE GROUP A $2 BILLION VENTURE WITH FOUR LOCATIONS AND 22 SUBSIDIARIES??THE NEWEST IS BOYALIFE GENOMICS. WHILE ACTING AS FOUNDER AND CEO OF BOYALIFE XU IS ALSO AN ADJUNCT PROFESSOR OF MOLECULAR MEDICINE AT PEKING UNIVERSITY WHERE HE??S HERALDED AS AN EXPERT IN EVERYTHING FROM ARTHRITIS TO ONCOLOGY. PRIOR TO THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS NEW CLONING FACTORY THE 44-YEAR-OLD XU HAD REMAINED OUT OF THE GLOBAL SPOTLIGHT. BUT WITH THE NEWS THAT HIS TIANJIN VENTURE HOPES TO CLONE MORE MAMMALS IN A YEAR THAN HUMANITY HAS MANAGED TO CLONE IN THE PREVIOUS 200000 HIS PHONE HAS STARTED RINGING OFF THE HOOK. CLONING OR ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION IS A NATURALLY OCCURRING PHENOMENON IN NATURE. A NUMBER OF PLANTS BACTERIA AND SINGLE-CELLED ORGANISMS REPRODUCE THIS WAY. FUNGI FOR EXAMPLE SPLIT IN TWO STRAWBERRIES GROW CLONES OF THEMSELVES ON THEIR STEMS. ARTIFICIAL CLONING WHICH XU??S TEAM WILL USE TO MAKE CATTLE IS DECIDEDLY MORE COMPLICATED. THE SCIENCE WORLD RECOGNIZES THREE TYPES OF CLONING: GENETIC THERAPEUTIC AND REPRODUCTIVE. IT??S THE LAST ONE THAT??S USED TO CLONE WHOLE ANIMALS THROUGH A PROCESS CALLED NUCLEAR TRANSFER. TO DO THIS RESEARCHERS REPLACE THE DNA FROM A NEW CELL WITH THAT OF AN ANIMAL THEY INTEND TO CLONE. EVENTUALLY THE MODIFIED EGG IS PLACED INSIDE AN ADULT FEMALE WHO LATER GIVES BIRTH TO THE CLONE. WHILE RESEARCHERS REPORTEDLY CLONED FROGS AS EARLY AS THE 1950S SCIENTISTS WEREN??T ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY CLONE A MAMMAL UNTIL DECADES LATER. IT WAS THREE SCIENTISTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH WHO ACHIEVED THE FEAT WITH THE BIRTH OF A CLONED SHEEP IN 1996??THE ONLY ONE TO SUCCEED OUT OF 277 ATTEMPTS TO LIVE. THE CLONE WAS NAMED DOLLY BECAUSE IT WAS MADE FROM THE CELL OF A MAMMARY GLAND AND THE RESEARCHERS ??COULDN??T THINK OF A MORE IMPRESSIVE PAIR THAN DOLLY PARTON??S.? IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS CLONING AS A SCIENCE TOOK OFF WITH RESEARCHERS PRODUCING SUCCESSFUL CLONES OF A RHESUS MONKEY COW GOAT AND MORE. TODAY A NUMBER OF COMPANIES EXIST TO CLONE ANIMALS WITH SOME FOCUSED ON FARM LIVESTOCK LIKE BULLS AND COWS AND OTHERS ON AN INCREASINGLY BIG BUSINESS: FAMILY DOGS. THE LARGEST OF THESE COMPANIES SOOAM BIOTECH HAS REPORTEDLY CLONED 700 PUPPIES SINCE OPENING IN 2004. THE SOUTH KOREAN FIRM ACTUALLY PAIRED WITH XU TO CREATE BOYALIFE GENOMICS BUT IN AN EMAIL TO THE DAILY BEAST DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE NEW VENTURE. BUT IF IT??S DEVOTION TO CLONING DOGS IS ANY INDICATION (??[WE] HEAL THE BROKEN HEARTS?) IT COULD PLAY A BIG ROLE IN BOYALIFE??S FUTURE. YET EVEN AS COMPANIES LIKE SOOAM GROW IN POPULARITY ANXIETY HAS MOUNTED AROUND THE IDEA OF HOW FAR CLONING COULD GO. ONE OF SOOAM??S OWN RESEARCHERS HWANG WOO-SUK ONCE ALLEGED THAT HE HAD CLONED HUMAN EMBRYOS. THE CLAIM HAS SINCE BEEN STRUCK DOWN BUT THE FEAR ASSOCIATED WITH IT DEFINITELY HAS NOT. WHILE THE GENERAL PUBLIC WEIGHS THE PROS AND CONS OF ANIMAL CLONING THE LEGAL WORLD IS DOING THE SAME. IN THE U.S. CLONING OF FARM ANIMALS IS CURRENTLY LEGAL??WITH THE FEDERAL DRUG ADMINISTRATION DECLARING THAT THESE CLONES ARE AS ??SAFE AS THE FOOD WE EAT EVERY DAY.? THE SAME IS TRUE IN CHINA BUT NOT EVERYWHERE. IN AUGUST THE EUROPEAN UNION EDGED CLOSER TO OUTLAWING THE PRACTICE ALL TOGETHER WITH THE EU PARLIAMENT VOTING IN FAVOR OF A SWEEPING CLONING BAN THAT WOULD INCLUDE FARM ANIMALS. MEANWHILE LAWS SURROUNDING THE CLONING OF HUMANS REMAIN MURKY. IN THE U.S. THERE IS NO FEDERAL LAW EXPLICITLY BANNING HUMAN CLONES??WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT THE PRACTICE IS WHOLLY LEGAL. AT LEAST 15 STATES HAVE PASSED LEGISLATION REGARDING HUMAN CLONING??EIGHT OF WHICH PROHIBIT IT ENTIRELY. THE UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY BANNED THE PRACTICE IN 2005 AND THE SCIENCE WORLD AS A WHOLE REJECTS IT AS UNETHICAL AND UNSAFE. LEADERS AT THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCE HAVE BEEN PETITIONING FOR A WORLDWIDE BAN ON THE PRACTICE SINCE 2002 CALLING IT ??DANGEROUS AND LIKELY TO FAIL.? AMONG OTHER OUTSPOKEN ORGANIZATIONS ARE THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION?ŸAMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE AND THE FDA. DURING A 2002 CONGRESSIONAL HEARING ON HUMAN CLONING A RESEARCHER NAMED RUDOLF JAENISCH SPELLED OUT WHY HE BELIEVED ANIMAL CLONING WAS TOO DANGEROUS TO MIMIC IN HUMANS. SUCCESSFUL ANIMAL CLONES HE SAID ARE PRECEDED BY MANY FAILED ATTEMPTS. THOSE THAT MAKE IT ARE OFTEN PLAGUED WITH HEALTH ISSUES. INDEED REPRODUCTIVE CLONING IN ANIMALS??THE SAME TYPE THAT COULD IN THEORY BE USED ON HUMANS??COMES WITH IMMENSE RISK. THE PERCENTAGE OF CLONING EFFORTS THAT SUCCEED IS GENERALLY BETWEEN ONE AND FOUR PERCENT. IN THE FEW CLONES THAT SURVIVEBIIRTH DEFECTS ABOUND??RANGING FROM BRAIN DEFICIENCIES TO DRASTICALLY SHORTENED LIFE SPANS. AND EVEN THOUGH HE PLANS TO CLONE 1 MILLION COWS ONE DAY XU LIKE THE MAJORITY OF HIS SCIENTIFIC PEERS SAYS HE IS GRAVELY AGAINST THE CONCEPT OF HUMAN CLONES. ??NO WE DON??T DO HUMAN CLONING WE WON??T MAKE FRANKENSTEINS? XU TOLD NBC. ??THE TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE IS VERY ADVANCED??[BUT] EVERY TECHNOLOGY HAS TO HAVE A BOUNDARY.? ,53565.0

PULL UP THE FAINTING COUCH AMERICA. READY THE SMELLING SALTS AND HAVE A STURDY FRIEND NEARBY TO PASS YOU A SNIFTER OF BRANDY TO CALM YOUR NERVES. I??M ABOUT TO DROP SOME TRUTH. RATS ARE NOT HUMAN BEINGS. I WILL GIVE YOU A MOMENT TO COLLECT YOURSELVES. THE REASON I FEEL COMPELLED TO MAKE AN EARTH-SHATTERING ANNOUNCEMENT SUCH AS THIS IS APPARENTLY MAJOR NEWS OUTLETS CANNOT QUITE TELL THE DIFFERENCE. TO WIT THIS TWEET AND THE ASSOCIATED ARTICLE: IF THERE WERE A NOTION I COULD PURGE FROM THE NATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS IT WOULD BE THE IDEA THAT ??SCIENCE? EVER STANDS AT A PULPIT ??SHOWING? THINGS. SCIENCE IS NOT A MONOLITHIC WHOLE AND IT IS NOT REPRESENTED BY A LAB COAT-WEARING GENTLEMAN WITH SNOWY HAIR AND A LASER POINTER. IT IS NOT AN INSTITUTE THAT RELEASES PRESS MATERIALS AND IT DOESN??T HAVE A SPOKESPERSON. SCIENCE IS A METHOD FOR INVESTIGATING THE WORLD. IT IS PROPERLY APPLIED A MEANS FOR OBSERVING WHAT HAPPENS AROUND US OFFERING EXPLANATIONS FOR WHY THOSE THINGS HAPPEN AND TESTING THOSE EXPLANATIONS. OVER TIME EVIDENCE BUILDS UP THAT HELPS SUPPORT THE EXPLANATIONS THAT BEST WITHSTAND SCRUTINY. IT IS NOT A MOUTHPIECE THAT PRONOUNCES AT REGULAR INTERVALS ON VARIOUS SUBJECTS. A STUDY MAY OFFER A PIECE OF EVIDENCE ABOUT A PARTICULAR QUESTION (AND PLENTY OF STUDIES ARE GARBAGE) BUT NO SINGLE STUDY CAN EVER HOPE TO SPEAK FOR ??SCIENCE? AS A WHOLE. BUT IF CONFLATING THE RESULTS OF A SINGLE STUDY WITH THE ENTIRE SCIENTIFIC METHOD IS BAD ENOUGH GROSSLY OVERSTATING THE FINDINGS OF THAT STUDY IN A MANNER MEANT TO PLAY ON COMMON PARENTAL FEARS IS MUCH WORSE. WHICH BRINGS ME TO HOW TIME IS PRESENTING THESE FINDINGS IN PARTICULAR. DID RESEARCHERS FOLLOW NEW PARENTS AROUND AND TIME HOW OFTEN THEY STARED AT THEIR PHONES INSTEAD OF THEIR KIDS? DID THEY MONITOR THEIR INSTAGRAM AND FACEBOOK ACCOUNTS FOR DURATION SPENT ONLINE INSTEAD OF INTERACTING WITH THEIR CHILDREN? DID THE STUDY DEAL WITH HUMAN BEINGS WHATSOEVER? NO. IT DEALT WITH RATS. MORE SPECIFICALLY IT DEALT WITH RATS THAT WERE BORN INTO SPECIALLY DESIGNED ENVIRONMENTS WHERE RESOURCES FOR PROPER NESTING WERE DELIBERATELY MADE SCARCE. IT TURNS OUT THE MOTHER RATS IN THOSE ENVIRONMENTS WERE DISTRACTED BY THEIR INSUFFICIENT RESOURCES AND THEIR BABIES DIDN??T GET AS MUCH ATTENTION FROM THEM. COMPARED TO RATS RAISED IN NORMAL ENVIRONMENTS THOSE ATTENTION-DEPRIVED RATS SEEMED TO ENJOY PLEASURABLE THINGS SUCH AS SUGAR AND PLAYING LESS THAN PEERS. COULD THIS STUDY BE AN INTERESTING INSIGHT INTO THE WORKINGS OF RAT BRAINS? SURE. DOES IT SURPRISE ME TO LEARN THAT RATS RAISED BY MOTHERS STRESSED BY A LACK OF RESOURCES WOULD HAVE SOME KIND OF NEGATIVE LONG-TERM EFFECT? NOT IN THE LEAST. WHAT DOES THE STUDY ACTUALLY SAY ABOUT HUMAN PARENTS AND CELLPHONE USE? NOT A GODDAMN THING. HOWEVER IF YOU PIROUETTE OUT INTO ALL MANNER OF EXTRAPOLATION AND CONJECTURE YOU CAN COME UP WITH ALL SORTS OF EYE-CATCHING CONCLUSIONS. COULD ONE USE A BROAD DEFINITION LIKE ??DISTRACTION? TO DESCRIBE BOTH ONE??S ANDROID USE AND A RAT??S DESPERATELY SEARCHING FOR MATERIAL TO KEEP ITS BABY WARM? YES I SUPPOSE ONE COULD. AND IT SEEMS THAT??S ALL THE SIMILARITY NECESSARY TO APPLY CONCLUSIONS FROM THE LATTER TO HUMAN BEINGS DOING THE FORMER. THE EFFECTS OF ??DISTRACTED PARENTING? COME UP FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE NEWS. HELL I??VE WRITTEN ABOUT MY OWN FRUSTRATIONS WITH PARENTS WHO SPEND MORE TIME STARING AT THEIR IPHONES DURING VISITS THAN THEY DO TALKING WITH ME. IT??S MERELY MY OWN SUSPICION WITH NARY A STUDY DESIGN TO BACK IT UP BUT I SUSPECT IT??S BETTER FOR CHILDREN TO HAVE THEIR PARENTS?? UNDIVIDED ATTENTION ON A CONSISTENT BASIS. BUT THAT CONCLUSION RESTS ON MY OWN COMMON SENSE AND EXPERIENCE AS A PARENT RATHER THAN WILDLY MISAPPLIED FINDINGS FROM RESEARCH ON LAB RODENTS. SCIENTISTS ARE HUMAN BEINGS AND LIKE ALL PEOPLE WHO WORK HARD AT SOMETHING WANT THAT WORK TO GET VISIBILITY. HENCE PROMOTING THEIR FINDINGS IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO ATTRACT THE MOST ATTENTION LIKE SUGGESTING THEY MAY HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR PARENTS WHO USE CELLPHONES. BUT PRESS MATERIALS ABOUT A STUDY DESERVE JUST AS MUCH SKEPTICISM AS THOSE FROM A MOVIE STUDIO OR POLITICIAN??S OFFICE. FAILING TO QUESTION WHETHER RAT BEHAVIORS IN A CAGE HAVE ANYTHING USEFUL TO TELL US ABOUT SOMETHING AS ENORMOUSLY COMPLEX AND NUANCED AS HUMAN CHILDREARING IS EGREGIOUS. SHOULD EVERY STUDY THAT DRAWS CONCLUSIONS FROM ANIMAL STUDIES BY DISCARDED OUT OF HAND? NO. BUT NEITHER SHOULD THEY BE PRESENTED AS TELLING EVERYONE WHAT ??SCIENCE? WRIT LARGE SHOWS ABOUT SOMETHING EVEN UNDER THE BEST OF CIRCUMSTANCES. FOR MY OWN PART I SUSPECT I??M AS GUILTY AS ANYONE OF BEING MORE DISTRACTED THAN I OUGHT BY MY OWN CELLPHONE. THERE??S ALWAYS SOMETHING TRENDING AND I GET BEGUILED TOO. MY NEW YEAR??S RESOLUTION WAS TO LEAVE MY SMART PHONE ON THE SHELF MORE OFTEN IN FACT. BUT RATS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH MY MEDIA HABITS AND THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH YOURS EITHER. ,3425.0
1,9544391.0,2016-01-01T05:01:00+00:00,WHY EVERYBODY SHOULD WORK IN HOLLYWOOD,I??M CONVINCED THAT WORKING IN HOLLYWOOD IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT WAY TO TEACH PEOPLE HOW TO WORK. YOU HAVE TO WORK WELL UNDER CONSTANT PRESSURE. YOU HAVE TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MORE THINGS THAN ANYONE SHOULD HAVE TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR. AND YOU HAVE TO BE CUNNING. I??VE WORKED IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION OF MAJOR MOTION PICTURES AND TELEVISION THEN SWITCHED OVER TO WORKING IN CONTENT AT AN ADVERTISING AGENCY AND NOW WORK AS A CREATIVE DIRECTOR AT A MEDIA COMPANY BUT IN ALL MY TRAVELS THE MOST INCREDIBLE WORKERS WERE THOSE WHO GOT THEIR START IN THE FILM & TELEVISION BIZ. WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE THINGS THAT MAKE ME GOOD AT MY JOB I CAN TRACE THEM BACK TO WHAT I LEARNED BEING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE FOOD CHAIN IN HOLLYWOOD AND FIGHTING MY WAY UP. HERE??S WHAT I LEARNED: THERE IS NO OTHER OPTION. IF YOU AREN??T GOOD WITH YOUR TIME AND YOU CAN??T STAY ORGANIZED YOU??LL NEVER MAKE IT IN THIS TOWN. IT??S TOO FAST THERE??S TOO MUCH HAPPENING AND IT??S TOO DEMANDING. YOU ARE IN THE OFFICE BEFORE YOUR BOSS AND STAY LONG AFTER. YOU ARE THE MANAGER AND KEEPER OF EVERY ASPECT OF THEIR LIFE ?? THEIR SCHEDULE THEIR CALLS THEIR PROJECTS THEIR MEETINGS AND YES THEIR PERSONAL STUFF. I HAD A BOSS WHO EXPECTED ME TO MAKE SURE THEIR CAR WAS ALWAYS FILLED WITH GAS. IF THEY EVER LEFT THE STUDIO AND DIDN??T HAVE ENOUGH GAS TO GET WHERE THEY WERE GOING IT WAS MY FAULT (I HAD TO OCCASIONALLY ASK FOR THEIR KEYS GO TO THEIR STUDIO SPOT TURN ON THEIR CAR CHECK FOR THE LEVELS AND DRIVE TO THE GAS STATION IF IT WAS LOW AND PRAY I DIDN??T CRASH THE CAR). I KNEW ANOTHER ASSISTANT WHO HAD TO ALWAYS DRIVE THEIR BOSS TO A WAXING APPOINTMENT BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO TAKE A XANAX. ANOTHER HAD TO TAKE THEIR BOSS??S ONLINE TRAFFIC SCHOOL FOR THEM WHEN THEY GOT A TICKET. YOU ARE THEIR KEEPER (OF THEIR LIVES AND THEIR SECRETS). AND BECAUSE YOU??RE BUSY MANAGING THEIR LIVES YOUR LIFE TAKES A BACKSEAT. I WOULD FORGET THINGS LIKE FRIENDS?? BIRTHDAYS OR TO PAY BILLS. ON TOP OF THAT I ALSO READ EVERY INCOMING SCRIPT SO I??D GET IN AN ADDITIONAL TWO HOURS EARLY TO MAKE SURE I COULD KNOCK TWO OUT BEFORE I EVEN STARTED MY REGULAR DAY. I SUFFERED IN MY FIRST HOLLYWOOD ASSISTANT GIG BECAUSE EVERYTHING TOOK ME LONGER THAN THE OTHER ASSISTANTS AT THE STUDIO. I PRIDE MYSELF AT BEING AN ORGANIZED PERSON BUT I DIDN??T GRASP THE KIND OF ORGANIZED MY BOSS NEEDED ME TO BE ?? IT WAS THEIR OFFICE NOT MINE. NOT ONLY IS THERE JUST SO MUCH TO DO AND KEEP TRACK OF YOU NEED TO LEARN TO DO IT THEIR WAY. I TRIED ALL SORTS OF METHODS TO HELP THIS BOSS STAY ORGANIZED UNTIL WE FINALLY CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT MAYBE WE JUST WEREN??T A MATCH. OUR PERSONALITIES WERE TOO DIFFERENT AND I WAS TOO FAR DOWN THE SPIRAL TO BE ABLE TO PICK MYSELF UP AND COME BACK I FELT DEFEATED. IT WAS HEARTBREAKING. I HAD ALWAYS BEEN RELIABLE SMART EFFICIENT AND WELL WANTED. AND HERE I WAS A LOWLY ASSISTANT WHOSE DUTIES I THOUGHT I SHOULD BE ABLE TO EASILY MASTER QUESTIONING MY WORK ETHIC. BUT IT DID MAKE ME BETTER. I WAS MORE PREPARED TO DEAL WITH JOB #2. IT WAS A FRESH START AND I WENT IN EYES OPEN ON LEARNING HOW TO WORK WITH A SPECIFIC KIND OF PERSONALITY HOW TO DELIVER ON UNIQUE EXPECTATIONS AND HOW TO STOP NEGATIVE THINKING AFFECT MY WORK. I WAS A MACHINE AT MY NEXT JOB AND WHILE THAT ONE HAD A NEW SET OF CHALLENGES I AM STILL ASTOUNDED AT HOW MUCH I GOT DONE EACH DAY. WHEN I MOVED INTO OTHER ROLES AT ADJACENT INDUSTRIES I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE SUCH POOR FOLLOW THROUGH. GREAT IDEAS FLOWED BUT THE HUSTLE AND ACCOUNTABILITY LACKED. WHEN YOU??RE DEALING WITH THE DESPERATION AND STARVATION WHEN IT COMES TO HOLLYWOOD DREAMS PEOPLE WILL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO GET THOSE DREAMS ACTUALIZED. I LEARNED THAT I WAS THE ONLY ONE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING THINGS HAPPEN AND NO ONE WAS GOING TO DO THAT BUT ME. BY CLIMBING THE LADDER OF SUCCESS PRODUCING A FILM OR GETTING A PROJECT OFF THE GROUND I REALIZED THE ABILITY TO JUST GET THINGS DONE WAS AN INVALUABLE SKILL. YOU HAVE TO CONSTANTLY MAKE DECISIONS AND QUICKLY AND NOT FUCK UP. SHOULD I INTERRUPT BOSS IN THEIR CURRENT MEETING THAT THEY TOLD ME NOT TO INTERRUPT THEM FOR BUT IF I DON??T THEY??LL LOSE OUT ON THIS SCRIPT? HIGH PROFILE CELEBRITY IS SCHEDULED FOR A DINNER WITH BOSS AND WHEN YOU CONFIRMED THE RESERVATION THE RESTAURANT DIDN??T HAVE IT AND NOW WHAT? SHOULD I TELL BOSS THEY HAVE SOME PERSONAL MESSAGES ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE WHEN THERE??S A VERY GRAPHIC ONE A FRIEND SENT AND IF I TELL THEM WE??LL BOTH KNOW I HEARD IT BUT IF I DON??T WILL THEY NOT GET IT? EVERY DAY. CONSTANTLY. EXHAUSTIVELY. THERE ARE CHOICES TO BE MADE SOME IMPORTANT SOME NOT SO MUCH EXCEPT IN HOLLYWOOD IT??S ALL IMPORTANT. BECAUSE WHEN YOU FUCK UP IN HOLLYWOOD IT MAKES YOUR LIFE SO MUCH MORE MISERABLE THAN ANY OTHER INDUSTRY BECAUSE THERE??S NO ROOM FOR MISTAKES. THEY ARE UNFORGIVABLE. THE IRONY: THE ONLY WAY TO LEARN HOW NOT TO FUCK UP IS TO FUCK UP. BUT YOU ALSO MAKE OTHER DECISIONS A LOT FASTER ?? ABOUT YOURSELF. WHILE YOUR PEERS DAWDLE FOR MONTHS OR YEARS FIGURING OUT WHAT THEY??RE GOOD AT OR WHAT THEY LOVE THE PRESSURE COOKER OF HOLLYWOOD SPEEDS UP THAT PROCESS FOR YOU. BECAUSE YOU??RE CONSTANTLY FUCKING UP YOU FIGURE OUT QUICKLY HOW TO NOT FUCK UP. SINCE YOU??RE FEELING THE WRATH OF FUCKING UP ALL THE TIME YOU LEARN ABOUT WHAT KIND OF BOSS YOU WANT TO BE IN THE FUTURE (OR IN MY CASE WHAT KIND OF BOSS I ABSOLUTELY DIDN??T WANT TO BE). AND BECAUSE YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU DO AND NO NOT WANT TO PUT UP WITH YOU MAKE CHOICES ABOUT THE CAREER YOU WANT THE WORK THAT INTERESTS YOU AND THE THINGS IN YOUR LIFE THAT MATTER A LOT FASTER. I ONCE GOT MY DREAM JOB?? OR RATHER WHAT I THOUGHT WAS MY DREAM JOB EXCEPT I WAS IN TEARS EVERY NIGHT BECAUSE MY BOSS AT THE TIME WAS SUCH AN AWFUL HUMAN AND MADE MY LIFE MISERABLE. BUT THAT MISERY TAUGHT ME A LOT THE BIGGEST IS THAT I NOW HAVE A ??NO ASSHOLE? POLICY. IT DOESN??T MATTER THE WORK OR THE JOB I NOW ONLY WORK WITH PEOPLE I ENJOY SPENDING TIME WITH AND FOR BOSSES I LIKE AND RESPECT. YOU HAVE TO LEARN EVERY AGENT??S NAME AND THE NAMES OF THEIR ASSISTANT OF THE WEEK. YOU NEED TO KNOW WHO THE CURRENT HOT WRITERS ARE THEIR ENTIRE BODY OF WORK AND YOU BETTER HAVE READ IT ALL TOO. YOU NEED TO REMEMBER WHO ??THE PEOPLE? ARE OF THE CELEBRITIES YOU WORK WITH (MANAGERS AGENTS PR REPS ETC) THEIR KIDS?? NAMES THEIR BIRTHDAYS AND THEIR BLOOD TYPE. YOU NEED TO KNOW EVERYONE??S NAME ON SET AND HAVE THEIR CONTACT INFORMATION AT THE READY. THE POINT IS YOU NEED TO REMEMBER VOLUMES AND VOLUMES OF INFORMATION. AND I DON??T MEAN JUST HAVE GOOGLE AT THE READY ?? YOU NEED TO BE READY. WHEN YOUR BOSS ASKS YOU YOU HAVE LESS THAN A SECOND TO RESPOND. NO TIME FOR YOU TO GO DIGGING THROUGH YOUR PHONE OR NOTEBOOK YOU JUST HAVE TO KNOW. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU GET PRETTY GOOD AT IT. I DID. I BECAME A SPONGE. I LEARNED ALL THOSE NAMES AND KEPT TRACK OF WHO WAS MOVING TO OTHER AGENCIES OR STUDIOS. WHEN I WORKED ON SETS I MADE A MINI VERSION OF THE CREW LIST AND CALLSHEETS LAMINATED THEM AND KEPT THEM ON A KEY RING AROUND MY NECK. I WAS ALWAYS READY FOR WHATEVER INFORMATION I NEEDED TO CONJURE UP IN A MOMENT. AND I STILL HAVE A REPUTATION FOR BEING A STEEL TRAP. I TRAINED MY BRAIN TO BE LIKE THAT AND IT??S SERVED ME INCREDIBLY WELL. BECAUSE OF THE PACE OF LIFE (THE PRESSURE COOKER THE HARSH HOURS THE PERSONALITIES) YOU LEARN TO BE DETAILED AND GET TO THE POINT. BOSS CAN??T BE EXPECTED TO REMEMBER EVERYTHING (THAT??S YOUR JOB ?? SEE PREVIOUS POINT) AND HAS BETTER THINGS TO DO THAN TALK TO YOU SO YOU ARE ALWAYS DETAILED IN YOUR COMMUNICATION. YOU DON??T JUST SAY ??YOUR 1PM IS HERE? (THE STANDARD TIME FOR A HOLLYWOOD LUNCH). YOU SAY ??YOUR 1PM LUNCH WITH HIGH PROFILE CELEBRITY IS JUST PULLING UP TO THE LOT SO THEY??RE ABOUT FIVE MINUTES OUT AND I??VE LAID OUT LUNCH IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM (AND YES NO MAYO).? YOU DON??T JUST SAY YOU??RE ALMOST DONE WITH SCRIPT COVERAGE. YOU SAY YOU??RE ALMOST DONE WITH ??X SCRIPT THAT CAME IN TUESDAY BY BIG WRITER AND Y SCRIPT BY LESSER KNOWN WRITER THAT CAME IN TODAY AND EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT IT SO THEY??LL HAVE COVERAGE FOR BOTH BY 8PM.? THERE IS NO ROOM FOR FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS THAT WILL ANNOY BOSS OR FOR SPEECHES. AND IF THEY??RE ASKING ABOUT SOMETHING? YOU??VE ALREADY FAILED. YOU FUCKED UP. I HAD A BOSS THAT WOULD TELL ME FIVE TIMES A DAY ??CONSTANT UPDATES? AND I HAVE THEIR VOICE IN MY HEAD TO THIS DAY. THEY WANTED TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WAS HAPPENING WITH EVERYTHING THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND IF THEY HAD TO ASK THEY WERE PISSED. I NEEDED TO BE ON THE READY AND FIND THE MOMENTS THROUGHOUT THE DAY TO PROACTIVELY UPDATE THEM. SPEAKING OF BEING PROACTIVE IT??S THE GAME CHANGER IN ALL OF THIS. ON MY FIRST INTERNSHIP I WATCHED IN AWE AS EFFICIENT ASSISTANTS WOULD ORGANIZE SOMETHING BECAUSE THEY SAW A NEED FOR IT ON TOP OF THEIR MOUNTAINS OF WORK WITHOUT BEING ASKED. I KNOW THAT SOUNDS PRETTY BASIC BUT IT WAS A GREAT LESSON TO LEARN SO YOUNG. YOU WEREN??T GOING TO GET ANYWHERE BY DOING JUST WHAT??S ASKED OF YOU ?? YOU NEED TO STEP IT UP. BECAUSE THIS IS HOLLYWOOD AND WE??RE ALL STARVING. SO BE BETTER THAN THE PERSON NEXT TO YOU BE INDISPENSABLE AND BE PROACTIVE WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING YOUR BOSS AND EVERYONE ELSE AT THE COMPANY??S LIVES BETTER. SEE WHAT NEEDS FIXING AND JUST FIX IT. I APPLY THE SAME SKILLS IN A SENIOR ROLE WHEN IT COMES TO GROWING A TEAM GROWING A BUSINESS AND MAKING THINGS BETTER AND MORE EFFICIENT. IT??S ALSO THE ONLY WAY YOU??RE GOING TO GET PROMOTED OUT OF THAT ASSISTANT ROLE ?? THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS. YOU??LL PUT UP WITH SCREAMERS MANIPULATORS PHONIES PEOPLE THAT GET AWAY WITH SHIT THAT MAKES YOU LOOK AROUND INCREDULOUSLY AT EVERYONE ELSE THAT??S ALLOWING THEM TO ACT THAT WAY PEOPLE THAT ONLY WANT TO BE FRIENDS WITH YOU BECAUSE OF WHERE YOU WORK CELEBRITIES YOU NEED TO FUNCTION AROUND EVEN IF THEY??RE YOUR HEROES AND PEOPLE TREATING YOU AND HITTING ON YOU IN WAYS THAT WOULD BE DEEMED INCREDIBLY UNPROFESSIONAL AND LIABLE IN ANY OTHER INDUSTRY. YOU LET IT ALL ROLL OFF YOU. YOU HAVE TO. BECAUSE YOU TELL YOURSELF IF YOU??RE MISERABLE FOR JUST THIS ONE YEAR THIS ONE JOB THE PAYOFF WILL BE BIG. SO YOU ENDURE. BECAUSE IT??S ALL A GAME THE MOST DIFFICULT GAME ON THE PLANET. IN HOLLYWOOD HE WHO LASTS THE LONGEST MAKES IT. AND YOU REALIZE THE FUCKING UP THE CRAZIES THE LONG HOURS AND THE IMMENSE EFFORT IT ALL TAKES??THAT??S WHAT MAKES YOU BETTER THE BEST.

AND IF I WERE HIS PEDIATRICIAN I WOULD TELL HIM IN THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE TERMS THAT I WOULD DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO STOP HIM FROM EVEN THINKING ABOUT IMMERSING A CHILD IN THE TOXIC BREW HE LET FESTER THERE FOR SO LONG. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SNYDER AND THE FAMILIES TRYING TO SURVIVE IN FLINT IS THAT HE ACTUALLY HAS A CHOICE. IMAGINE IF SNYDER AND THE STATE WERE ACTUALLY THE PARENTS OR LEGAL GUARDIANS OF THE YOUNG CHILDREN IN FLINT. IT??S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT A PARENT WHO SAW HIS TAP WATER FULL OF LEAD AND KEPT GIVING IT TO HIS CHILD WOULD BE PROSECUTED FOR FELONY CHILD ABUSE. ??A PERSON IS GUILTY OF CHILD ABUSE IN THE SECOND DEGREE IF??THE PERSON KNOWINGLY OR INTENTIONALLY COMMITS AN ACT LIKELY TO CAUSE SERIOUS PHYSICAL OR MENTAL HARM TO A CHILD? MICHIGAN PENAL CODE SECTION 750.136B STATES. ??[THIS] IS A FELONY PUNISHABLE BY IMPRISONMENT FOR A FIRST OFFENSE OF NOT MORE THAN 10 YEARS??[AND] FOR A SECOND OR SUBSEQUENT OFFENSE NOT MORE THAN 20 YEARS.? LET??S PUT ASIDE THE IDEA THAT OFFICIALS SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS WHEN FLINT??S WATER SUPPLY WAS FIRST SWITCHED TO CONTAMINATED RIVER WATER SOME TWO YEARS AGO. WHAT IS NOT IN DOUBT IS THE FACT THAT ALMOST A YEAR AGO WHEN STATE AGENCIES WERE MADE AWARE OF THE CONTAMINATED WATER SUPPLY AND HIGH BLOOD LEAD LEVELS IN MANY CHILDREN MICHIGAN OFFICIALS ACTIVELY ATTEMPTED TO BURY THE DATA AND REFUSED TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION. THOUGH THE STATE IS FINALLY TAKING ACTION IT??S NOT NEARLY ENOUGH. THE FIRST PRIORITY IS TO STOP ANY ONGOING EXPOSURE. SWITCHING THE FLINT WATER SUPPLY SOURCE FROM THE HIGHLY LEAD-CONTAMINATED FLINT RIVER BACK TO THE DETROIT WATER SYSTEM FED BY LAKE HURON WAS THE RIGHT FIRST STEP BUT NOW THERE REMAINS THE DAUNTING AND EXPENSIVE CHALLENGE OF REPLACING EVERY CORRODED LEAD-LEECHING WATER PIPE IN FLINT. AS FOR EMERGENCY MEASURES FIREFIGHTERS AND A FEW NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS HANDING OUT WATER BOTTLES AND FILTERS ARE NOT THE ANSWER. LARGE-SCALE EMERGENCY WATER SUPPLY SYSTEMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN ALONG WITH PORTABLE SHOWERS MUCH AS WOULD HAPPEN IN THE AFTERMATH OF A MAJOR NATURAL DISASTER. CLEARLY THIS IS A JOB FOR THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY AND THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE WHO NOW HAVE THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO ACT AFTER PRESIDENT OBAMA??S DECLARATION OF EMERGENCY IN FLINT. SECOND STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES MUST ESTABLISH SYSTEMS TO TRACK AFFECTED CHILDREN AND SUPPORT COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES FOR ANY CHILD POTENTIALLY EXPOSED TO LEAD. OFFICIALS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES ARE HEADED TO FLINT THIS WEEK AND HAVE BEEN DIRECTED TO COME UP WITH A GAME PLAN THAT ADDRESSES THE NEEDS OF AFFECTED CHILDREN. SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES WILL BE NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT LEAD POISONED CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO ONGOING MEDICAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL MONITORING. THIS MEANS EARLY HIGH QUALITY PRE-SCHOOL AND ENRICHED HEAD START PROGRAMS FOLLOWED BY LEARNING SUPPORT SERVICES IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS ALONG WITH PARENTAL GUIDANCE TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND THEIR CRITICAL ROLE IN BOLSTERING COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT IN THEIR CHILDREN. HOPEFULLY THESE MEASURES WILL HELP MITIGATE SOME OF THE DAMAGE DONE TO DEVELOPING BRAINS AFFECTED BY HIGH LEVELS OF LEAD A POTENT NEUROTOXIN. THIRD AS SNYDER EMPHASIZED IN TUESDAY??S STATE OF THE STATE MESSAGE THERE MUST BE ACCOUNTABILITY. AS A PEDIATRICIAN I COULDN??T AGREE MORE. WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE CHILDREN OF FLINT UNDER HIS WATCH IS DEVASTATING AND UNCONSCIONABLE. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IRREVERSIBLE BRAIN DAMAGE THAT MAY WELL AFFECT THE REST OF THEIR LIVES.

885,10100465.0,2016-01-20T05:01:00+00:00,UNFUZZY MATH: IT??S STILL HILLARY CLINTON??S RACE TO LOSE,HER BIG LEAD HAS MELTED AWAY IN IOWA AND SHE??S BEHIND IN NEW HAMPSHIRE THE STATE THAT REWARDED HER IN 2008 AND THAT MADE HER HUSBAND THE ??COMEBACK KID? IN 1992. THE POSSIBILITY THAT HILLARY CLINTON COULD LOSE THE FIRST TWO CONTESTS HAS REVIVED TALK OF A ??NIGHTMARE SCENARIO? WHERE THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY RACE DRAGS ON TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE EVENTUAL NOMINEE WHO WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY BE CLINTON. UNLIKE THE ??08 PRIMARY RACE WHICH RALLIED THE PARTY AND INSPIRED YOUNG PEOPLE AND AFRICAN AMERICANS THE FEAR THIS TIME IS THAT A PROTRACTED BATTLE BETWEEN CLINTON AND BERNIE SANDERS WOULD NOT HAVE THE UPSIDE OF ??08 BUT WOULD LEAVE CLINTON A WOUNDED NOMINEE. WE GOT A TASTE OF HOW A CLINTON-SANDERS FIGHT MIGHT UNFOLD WHEN CHELSEA CLINTON IN NEW HAMPSHIRE PUMMELED SANDERS FOR WANTING TO DISMANTLE MUCH OF THE EXISTING HEALTH-CARE SAFETY NET INCLUDING OBAMACARE AND MEDICARE WHICH SHE CLAIMED WOULD EMPOWER GOVERNORS THREE-FIFTHS OF WHOM ARE REPUBLICANS. SHE LEFT OUT THE PART ABOUT REPLACING IT WITH A SINGLE PAYER MEDICARE FOR ALL PROGRAM. IT??S FAIR TO ASK HOW SANDERS WOULD PULL THIS OFF AND HOW HE WOULD PAY FOR IT BUT THE NORMALLY RESERVED AND ABOVE-THE-BATTLE CHELSEA WAS SO OVER-THE-TOP YOU??D THINK SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT TED CRUZ INSTEAD OF SANDERS. CLINTON IS FACING SOME TOUGH CHOICES NOW AS THE RACE TIGHTENS WHETHER TO GO NEGATIVE AGAINST SANDERS WORK HARDER TO REACH THE YOUNG VOTERS THAT ARE FLOCKING TO HIM OR FOCUS ON RALLYING HER BASE WHICH IS OLDER VOTERS AND ESPECIALLY OLDER WOMEN. NOT ONE OF THE SEVERAL SEASONED CAMPAIGN OPERATIVES AND ANALYSTS CONSULTED FOR THIS ARTICLE BELIEVE CLINTON WILL LOSE THE NOMINATION. CHARLIE COOK A VETERAN NON-PARTISAN HANDICAPPER SAID ??SHE FACES A MONTH FROM HELL AND SHE SHOULD JUST TOUGH IT OUT. THE MORE DESPERATE SHE ACTS AND LOOKS AND BECOMES THE MORE IT WILL COST HER IN THE GENERAL.? THE PRE-IOWA BOOST THAT SANDERS IS ENJOYING IS REMINISCENT OF THE ATTENTION THAT BILL BRADLEY GOT IN 2000 DURING HIS PRIMARY CHALLENGE AGAINST VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE A RACE SEEN AS A CORONATION MUCH LIKE THE CLINTON CANDIDACY TODAY. ??PEOPLE LIKE TO HAVE OPTIONS? RECALLS MATT BENNETT WHO WORKED IN THE CLINTON WHITE HOUSE AND TRAVELED WITH GORE. BRADLEY WAS A THOUGHTFUL SENATOR AND A FORMER NBA STAR SO HE HAD CELEBRITY. ??BUT HE DIDN??T HAVE ANY OF THE CROWD-STIRRING MOXIE BERNIE HAS. IF HE HAD WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE SAME POSITION HILLARY IS IN NOW? SAYS BENNETT WHO IS NOW WITH THIRD WAY A CENTRIST DEMOCRATIC GROUP. BRADLEY HAD A NICE BOOMLET GOING BUOYED BY THE DEMOCRATIC LEFT BUT HE LOST IOWA TWO-TO-ONE AND THEN NEW HAMPSHIRE DASHED HIS HOPES WHEN THE STATE??S ??UNDECLARED? VOTERS A GOOD PORTION OF THE ELECTORATE THAT BRADLEY WAS COUNTING ON WENT WITH JOHN MCCAIN WHOSE MAVERICK CAMPAIGN ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE HAD MORE BOX OFFICE APPEAL. TODAY DONALD TRUMP??S CANDIDACY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SHAKE THINGS UP IN UNPREDICTABLE WAYS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. STILL SAYS BENNETT IF YOU TALK TO PEOPLE AT BERNIE RALLIES ??THESE AREN??T FOLKS WHO ARE DUG IN WHO WOULD NEVER COME AROUND. ALL THESE COLLEGE KIDS AT BERNIE RALLIES ARE GOING TO BE WAVING HILLARY BANNERS BY THE FALL I GUARANTEE IT.? IF CLINTON LOSES IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE HER MUCH TOUTED FIREWALL OF MINORITY VOTERS IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH WILL BE TESTED. BUT EVEN IF YOU GIVE SANDERS EVERY DELEGATE IN IOWA PLUS THE DELEGATES FROM EVERY CAUCUS STATE AND EVERY STATE IN NEW ENGLAND THE MOST LIBERAL PART OF THE COUNTRY HE??S STILL GOT ONLY 36 PERCENT OF THE DELEGATES SAYS COOK. HIS PATH TO THE NOMINATION IS WAY WAY TOO NARROW. NO CHANCE HE GETS THE NOMINATION. YET COOK SAYS THERE??S A 15-20 PERCENT CHANCE ??AND THAT MIGHT BE HIGH? THAT HILLARY DOESN??T GET IT EITHER. THAT??S IF THE FBI DECIDES TO TAKE SOME ACTION AGAINST HER IN THE ONGOING E-MAIL INVESTIGATION WHICH WOULD MEAN JOE BIDEN STEPPING IN. HE TOOK HIMSELF OUT OF THE RACE LATE LAST YEAR BUT ??IF THE NOMINATION WERE GOING TO BE HANDED TO HIM ON A SILVER PLATTER WHICH IT WOULD BE THAT CHANGES THINGS? SAYS COOK. THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT CLINTON??S SKILLS AS A CANDIDATE AND ABOUT THE BAGGAGE SHE CARRIES AFTER A LONG CAREER IN PUBLIC LIFE BUT HER CAMPAIGN THIS TIME IS A SMOOTHLY RUNNING OPERATION FREE OF THE RANCOR AND INFIGHTING THAT HURT HER IN ??08. SO WHAT HAS GONE WRONG TO ERODE HER STANDING? ??I DON??T KNOW THAT IT??S RIGHT TO SAY ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR HAS ??GONE WRONG?? FOR HILLARY IN IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE? DAVID AXELROD RESPONDED IN AN EMAIL. HE MANAGED BARACK OBAMA??S CAMPAIGN AGAINST CLINTON IN ??08. ??IOWA HAS ALWAYS BEEN POISED FOR A CANDIDATE LIKE SANDERS TO DO WELL AND SHE HAS HEDGED AGAINST THAT BY BUILDING A FAR STRONGER ORGANIZATION THERE THAN SHE HAD IN ??08. I STILL RATE HER A SLIGHT FAVORITE TO WIN THERE. ??NEW HAMPSHIRE IS A HOME GAME FOR BERNIE SO SHE IS FIGHTING UPHILL? AXELROD CONTINUED. ??BEYOND THOSE STATES HOWEVER THE TERRAIN TURNS SHARPLY IN HER FAVOR WHICH WASN??T THE CASE IN 2008. IRONICALLY HER FIREWALL MAY BE HER GAUDY LEAD AMONG MINORITY VOTERS WHO WENT IN LARGE NUMBERS TO OBAMA IN 2008. TWIN LOSSES TO START THE YEAR WOULD BE DAMAGING AND SURELY LENGTHEN THE RACE WHICH IS FAR FROM IDEAL. BUT EVEN IF SHE DOES LOSE THEM SHE WOULD BE THE FAVORITE COMING OUT OF IT ALBEIT A NERVOUS ONE.? WHAT CLINTON LACKS IS THE ENERGY AND PASSION THAT FUELED OBAMA??S RACE TO THE WHITE HOUSE. ??BERNIE ISN??T HILLARY??S PROBLEM? SAYS COOK. ??HE??S THE SYMPTOM OF A PROBLEM A SIGN OF UNREST IN THE COUNTRY AND IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THERE??S NOT A WHOLE LOT OF ENERGY FOR HER EXCEPT FOR WOMEN VOTERS WHO ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY OVER 55.? YOUNGER WOMEN HAVE A HARD TIME SEEING CLINTON??S POSSIBLE ASCENT TO THE OVAL OFFICE AS SOMETHING NEW. THERE HASN??T BEEN A TIME IN THEIR LIFE WHEN SHE WASN??T AT THE CENTER OF AMERICAN POLITICS. IF SHE WINS THE NOMINATION THE UPS AND DOWNS OF IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE WILL FADE INTO MEMORIES.?ŸTHE BATTLES CLINTON HAS PREPARED FOR ALL HER LIFE WILL COME INTO FOCUS AND CHANGE THE CONTOURS OF THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE IN WAYS THAT NO CANDIDATE OTHER THAN CLINTON COULD BE PREPARED FOR. ,20294.0

WITHOUT FURTHER ADO THE DAILY BEAST SENIOR ENTERTAINMENT EDITOR MARLOW STERN AND SENIOR WRITER JEN YAMATO BREAK DOWN THE BEST MOVIES AND PERFORMANCES OF THE 2016 SUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL.

HE PLAYS A 13-YEAR-OLD AMERICAN BOY (AND ASPIRING MC) STRUGGLING TO ADAPT TO LIFE IN EDM-HEAVY HEIDELBERG GERMANY WHERE HIS FATHER WORKS AS A SOCCER COACH.

JEN??S PICK:?ŸNATE PARKER THE BIRTH OF A NATION PLENTY OF FRESH FACES MADE THEIR MARK AT SUNDANCE 2016 BUT NO SINGLE WRITER DIRECTOR STAR OR PRODUCER HAD THE FESTIVAL BUZZING LIKE PARKER WHO BATTLED FOR SEVEN YEARS AND PULLED QUADRUPLE DUTY TO BRING HIS FIERY BIOPIC OF SLAVE PREACHER TURNED REBEL NAT TURNER TO THE BIG SCREEN. PARKER 36 MADE HIS ACTING BONES IN FILMS LIKE THE GREAT DEBATERS AND RED TAILS BUT IN THE BIRTH OF A NATION HE GAVE HIMSELF THE GIFT OF A CAREER-MAKING STAR TURN. PARKER??S TALENTS ARE ON DISPLAY IN HIS EMOTIONAL PERFORMANCE AS TURNER WHOSE DEVOUT FAITH IS TESTED AND TRANSFORMED BY THE INDIGNITIES OF BONDAGE. THAT TURNER??S INCENDIARY STORY ROUSED A LANDMARK $17.5 MILLION DEAL OUT OF AN INDUSTRY CURRENTLY GRAPPLING WITH ITS OWN RACIAL IMBALANCE OF POWER MEANS PARKER??S IMPACT IS ALREADY RESONATING BEYOND THE SLOPES OF PARK CITY. THE BIRTH OF A NATION HERALDS THE ENTRANCE OF A BOLD NEW HOLLYWOOD PLAYER AND PAVES THE WAY FOR OTHERS TO FOLLOW SUIT.?Ÿ BEST MALE PERFORMANCE MARLOW??S PICK: VIGGO MORTENSEN CAPTAIN FANTASTIC THIS WAS A TOUGH DECISION TO MAKE. MUCH INK HAS RIGHTFULLY BEEN SPILLED OVER CASEY AFFLECK??S DEVASTATING UNDERSTATED TURN AS A MAN WHOSE SOUL HAS BEEN TORN TO PIECES IN KENNETH LONERGAN??S MANCHESTER BY THE SEA BUT THE PERFORMANCE THAT AFFECTED ME THE MOST WAS MORTENSEN??S WHO GIVES HIS ALL AS BEN THE PATRIARCH TO A BROOD OF SIX KIDS RAISED IN THE FOREST ON DEER AND CHOMSKY ONLY TO BE THRUST BACK INTO UNWELCOMING SOCIETY AT A MOMENT??S NOTICE. THIS IS THE ROLE OF MORTENSEN??S CAREER CAPITALIZING ON HIS UNIQUE BLEND OF RUSTIC SEXINESS GENTLE ARTSINESS AND SEARING INTELLECT IN THE SERVICE OF ONE OF CINEMA??S GREATEST DADS. OH AND YOU??LL GET TO SIT BACK AND TAKE IN THE FULL VIGGO IN DECIDEDLY COZIER CONFINES THAN A BATHHOUSE KNIFE FIGHT. JEN??S PICK: JAMES FRANCO GOAT IF PERFORMANCES SHOULD BE MEASURED IN POTENCY OF PATHOS THERE WAS NONE MORE EFFECTIVE IN SECONDS OF SCREEN TIME THAN ACADEMY AWARD NOMINEE JAMES FRANCO??S BRIEF-BUT-COMPELLING TURN IN THE HAZING DRAMA GOAT (WHICH HE ALSO PRODUCED).

STARS BEN SCHNETZER AND NICK JONAS NAVIGATE THE VIOLENT-MACHO IMPULSES OF COLLEGE-AGED FRAT BROS WITH SENSITIVITY BUT FRANCO??S CAMEO BARRELS INTO GOAT WITH A CRACKLING SPITTLING FORCE WE??VE RARELY SEEN FROM HIM. THE STRAIN OF EXISTENTIAL DESPERATION IN HIS EYES AS HE GRABS YOUNG SCHNETZER AND MANIACALLY BELLOWS ??PUNCH ME IN THE FACE!? IS AS HAUNTINGLY HUMAN A PIECE OF PERFORMANCE AS ANY OF HIS POLYMATH ARTISTIC ENDEAVORS.?Ÿ BEST FEMALE PERFORMANCE MARLOW??S PICK: MORGAN SAYLOR WHITE GIRL AS DANA BRODY THE PERPETUALLY ANGSTY FINGER-PLAYING DAUGHTER OF DAMIAN LEWIS??S SOLDIER-TERRORIST ON HOMELAND MORGAN SAYLOR WAS EMO PERSONIFIED A CHARACTER AS VILIFIED AS BELLA SWAN.

STILL HER TURN AS LEAH A PRIVILEGED WHITE COLLEGE GIRL WHO FALLS FOR HER KINDHEARTED PUERTO RICAN DRUG DEALER??ONLY TO BE FORCED INTO THE ROLE OF UNLIKELY DRUG LORD WHEN HE GETS THROWN IN THE SLAMMER??IS A HUGE STEP FORWARD FOR SAYLOR. IT??S EQUAL PARTS DARING SEXY AND THRILLING AS LEAH GOES TO FURTHER AND FURTHER EXTREMES TO FREE HER MAN FROM MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCING. IN THE PROCESS SHE SHINES A NECESSARY LIGHT ON WHITE PRIVILEGE RACIAL DYNAMICS THE DRUG WAR AND PENAL PREJUDICE.

AND IT??S A FILM THAT YOU??LL BE HEARING MORE OF COME NEXT AWARDS SEASON. IN TELLING THE STORY OF A SOUL-CRUSHED MAN IN EXILE (CASEY AFFLECK) WHO RETURNS HOME TO HIS SEASIDE TOWN TO CARE FOR HIS NEPHEW (LUCAS HEDGES) WHEN HIS OLDER BROTHER (KYLE CHANDLER) PASSES AWAY LONERGAN HAS PAINTED AN ELABORATE EMOTIONAL TAPESTRY OF GUILT GRIEF AND REDEMPTION. WHILE NOT THE FLASHIEST DIRECTORIAL EFFORT THE MAN BEHIND YOU CAN COUNT ON ME AND MARGARET CRAFTS CHARACTERS OF GREAT DEPTH WHOSE PEAKS AND VALLEYS ARE FULLY ABSORBED BY HIS AUDIENCE AND AS AFFLECK AND HEDGES NAVIGATE THEIR COMPLEX WEBS OF EMOTIONS WE TOO ARE NEGOTIATING OURS. I KNOW IT??S ONLY JANUARY BUT THIS MAY VERY WELL BE THE YEAR??S MOST DEVASTATING FILM AND IS AN ABSOLUTE TRIUMPH FOR ONE OF HOLLYWOOD??S MOST EMBATTLED FILMMAKERS. JEN??S PICK: ANNA ROSE HOLMER THE FITS I??M GOING TO USE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO HIGHLIGHT A SPECTACULAR DEBUT FROM A NEW DIRECTOR WHO THIS WEEK AMID HOLLYWOOD??S CURRENT WOMEN AND DIVERSITY CRISIS QUIETLY PROVED HERSELF A TALENT TO WATCH. THE FITS ISN??T FLASHY AND IT FEATURES ZERO STARS.

THE 2016 EDITION WAS NO EXCEPTION AND AMONG THE DOCUMENTARIES I SAW AT THIS YEAR??S FEST THE STANDOUT WOULD HAVE TO BE JOSH KRIEGMAN AND ELYSE STEINBERG??S APPROPRIATELY TITLED WEINER. THE FILM CHRONICLES DISGRACED POLITICIAN ANTHONY WEINER??S 2013 RUN FOR MAYOR OF NEW YORK??YOU KNOW THE ONE THAT CAME CRASHING DOWN WHEN THE INSATIABLE SCUMBAG GOT BUSTED AGAIN FOR SEXTING THIS TIME UNDER THE PSEUDONYM ??CARLOS DANGER.? WEINER PROBABLY FIGURED THIS WOULD BE HIS STREET FIGHT BUT INSTEAD WE??RE GIVEN A RINGSIDE SEAT TO ONE OF THE MOST DISASTROUS POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS IN RECENT MEMORY. IT??S EQUAL PARTS ENLIGHTENING AND INFURIATING??POOR HUMA!??FEATURING SEVERAL WACKY SEQUENCES THAT WILL FLOOR YOU. JEN??S PICK: ALL THESE SLEEPLESS NIGHTS POLISH DIRECTOR MICHEL MARCZAK SHOOK UP THIS YEAR??S WORLD CINEMA DOCUMENTARY COMPETITION WITH A FORMALLY SUBVERSIVE LOOK AT THE RESTLESS NIGHTS AND EARLY-MORNING DAYS OF ART KIDS IN WARSAW THAT PLAYS LIKE A 21ST CENTURY NOUVELLE VAGUE?ŸFEVER DREAM.

ROSS??S FILM ABOUT A HIPPIE PATRIARCH (VIGGO MORTENSEN) WHO RAISES HIS BROOD OF SIX IN THE FOREST BEFORE A TRAGEDY FORCES THEM TO RE-ENTER SOCIETY IS A HEARTWARMING FILM ABOUT THE BONDS OF FAMILY THAT ALSO RAISES BIG QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FLAWS OF MODERN-DAY PARENTING AND LIVING. AND IT??S CARRIED BY A POWERHOUSE PERFORMANCE FROM MORTENSEN WHO??S FOUND HIS DREAM ROLE HERE. ANOTHER TOWERING TURN LOOMS OVER LONERGAN??S MANCHESTER BY THE SEA AND IT COMES COURTESY OF CASEY AFFLECK WHO IS AT HIS BEST PLAYING A FONT OF SUFFERING AND SIMMERING RAGE. THE FILM PRESENTS A HARROWING PORTRAIT OF TWO LOST SOULS YOUNG AND OLD TRYING THEIR DAMNEDEST TO OVERCOME DEATH AND LONELINESS. THIS IS LONERGAN??S MAGNUM OPUS. JEN??S PICK: THE GREASY STRANGLER THIS YEAR AT SUNDANCE IT WAS PAINFULLY CLEAR THAT NORMCORE PARK CITY AUDIENCES HAVE FORGOTTEN WHAT WEIRD CINEMA TRULY IS??IF THEY EVER EVEN KNEW TO BEGIN WITH. THAT??S WHY THE AGGRESSIVELY BIZARRE THE GREASY STRANGLER LINGERED LONG AFTER ITS MIDNIGHT PREMIERE. YOU THINK PAUL DANO RIDING HARRY POTTER??S FARTING CORPSE IS ESOTERIC? TRY A GREASED-UP NAKED MURDERER SCRUBBING OFF HIS GIANT DONG IN A CARWASH AFTER EVERY GRISLY KILL. THAT AND MORE STRANGENESS FILLS EVERY FRAME OF JIM HOSKING??S WTF FEATURE DEBUT (READ ALL ABOUT IT HERE). CLICH??D LIFE-AFFIRMING QUIRKINESS AND B-LIST STARS HAVE MADE THE SUNDANCE INDIE GENRE TERMINALLY BORING. HERE??S THE ONE ENTRY THAT WOKE AUDIENCES UP BY WATERBOARDING THEM WITH A METAPHORICAL VAT OF MANIACAL PUTRID GREASE. THAT THE GREASY STRANGLER IS ALSO?ŸAN EXPLORATION OF EMOTIONALLY ARRESTED FATHER-SON DYNAMICS AND THE GENDERED CYCLES OF ABUSE AND MISANDRY (FILM FESTIVAL CATNIP!)

270,9700572.0,2016-01-07T05:01:00+00:00,WANT FEWER MURDERS? TAX GUNS AND AMMO,WITH A NEW NATIONAL PUSH TO COMBAT GUN VIOLENCE THE CITY OF SEATTLE HAS BEGUN TO TAX FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION IN AN AUDACIOUSLY CREATIVE WAY TO GET AROUND SECOND AMENDMENT PROTECTIONS ON GUNS. THE TAX HAS PASSED ITS FIRST COURT TEST SIGNALING AN APPROACH THAT OTHER MUNICIPALITIES COULD ADOPT WITH A $25 TAX ON EVERY FIREARM SOLD IN THE CITY TWO CENTS ON EVERY ROUND OF .22 CALIBER AMMUNITION AND A 5-CENT TAX FOR EVERY OTHER ROUND OF AMMUNITION. THE TAX WENT INTO EFFECT ON JANUARY 1ST?ŸAFTER SURVIVING A CHALLENGE FROM THE NRA AND OTHER GUN RIGHTS GROUPS WHEN KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE PALMER RUBINSON RULED IN DECEMBER THAT THE CITY OF SEATTLE HAS THE ??CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE TAXES? ?? WHICH AS SHE NOTED IS SEPARATE FROM THE CITY??S ABILITY TO REGULATE GUNS. CITY ATTORNEY PETE HOLMES WAS INITIALLY SURPRISED THE NRA DIDN??T ASK FOR A STAY IN THE JUDGE??S RULING WHEN FILING ITS APPEAL MONDAY IN STATE COURT.?Ÿ IF THE NRA SOUGHT CONSTITUTIONAL RELIEF THEY WOULD HAVE APPEALED IN FEDERAL COURT. BUT FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT THIS ISN??T ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION. ??EVERYBODY ASSUMES THIS IS ABOUT THE SECOND AMENDMENT BUT IT??S NOT AND THAT??S THE STORY? HOLMES TOLD THE DAILY BEAST IN A TELEPHONE INTERVIEW. ??NO ONE IS TELLING YOU THAT YOU CAN??T OWN OR BUY A GUN? SAYS HOLMES. ?Ÿ??WE BELIEVE WE ARE IN A SAFE HAVEN. WE??RE NOT REGULATING GUNS WE??RE SIMPLY ADDING A TAX.? IN SEATTLE SATISFYING THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS EASIER FOR GUN SAFETY ADVOCATES THAN CLEARING ??STATE PREEMPTION? A LEGISLATIVE BARRIER THAT THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION EMPLOYS TO BLOCK GUN SAFETY REGULATION IN SOME THREE-DOZEN STATES INCLUDING WASHINGTON.?Ÿ IT??S A SHORT STATUTE THE GUN RIGHTS LOBBY WRITES AND THEN MUSCLES THROUGH STATE LEGISLATURES SAYS NO OTHER BODY SUCH AS THE MUNICIPAL AUTHORITIES IN CITIES LIKE SEATTLE CAN REGULATE FIREARMS. THE NRA??S INSTITUTE OF LEGAL ACTION (ILA) CHURNS OUT THE STATUTES AND LAWMAKERS IN STATE AFTER STATE ARE HAPPY TO OBLIGE. AND WITH SO MANY STATE LEGISLATURES WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF THE NRA IT??S AN EFFECTIVE MANEUVER. HOLMES SAYS IT WAS THE UNDOING OF AN EXECUTIVE ORDER ISSUED TWO SEATTLE MAYORS AGO BANNING FIREARMS IN CITY PLAYGROUNDS AND PARKS. THE COURT OVERTURNED THE BAN NOT UNDER THE SECOND AMENDMENT BUT UNDER STATE PREEMPTION. SO IT IS A BIG DEAL IN SEATTLE THAT THIS MODEST TAX IS IN PLACE AND THAT THE MONEY IT GENERATES WILL GO TOWARD COMPILING DATA ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE AND PUTTING TARGETED INTERVENTION PROGRAMS IN PLACE.?Ÿ AFTER THE 2012 SANDY HOOK MASSACRE OF FIRST-GRADERS SEATTLE FUNDED A STUDY THAT FOUND PEOPLE WITH GUN SHOT WOUNDS TREATED AT HARBOR VIEW HOSPITAL THE REGIONAL TRAUMA CENTER ARE 30 PERCENT MORE LIKELY TO RETURN WITH ANOTHER GUNSHOT OR AS A HOMICIDE VICTIM. THE STUDY WAS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND DONE BY A CITY AND RESEARCHERS FOUND PARALLELS WITH ALCOHOL-RELATED INJURIES IN THE EARLY 1990??S. SPENDING 20-30 MINUTES WITH PATIENTS INJURED IN SUCH INCIDENTS BEFORE RELEASING THEM TO TALK ABOUT RISK AND THEIR CHANCES OF BEING READMITTED PAID OFF IN LOWER RE-ADMITTANCE RATES. THAT IS NOW CONSIDERED BEST PRACTICES IN ALL TRAUMA CENTERS WHEN IT COMES TO ALCOHOL. SO COULD SEATTLE DO THE SAME FOR GUNSHOT VICTIMS? IT WAS WORTH A SHOT AND WHEN THE SEED MONEY RAN OUT FOR THE GUN VIOLENCE VICTIM RESEARCH AND INTERVENTION PROGRAM THEN CITY COUNCIL PRESIDENT TIM BURGESS A FORMER SEATTLE POLICE OFFICER PROPOSED THE GUN VIOLENCE TAX TO FUND CONTINUED EFFORTS. NOT ALL PROPONENTS OF GUN REGULATION ARE FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE SEATTLE TAX. RALPH FASCITELLI BOARD PRESIDENT OF WASHINGTON CEASEFIRE AND A LONGTIME GUN SAFETY ADVOCATE PRAISES THE TAX AS A ??GOOD MORALE BOOST? BUT SAYS IT IS ??MORE SYMBOLIC THAN SIGNIFICANT? BECAUSE GUN BUYERS CAN EASILY AVOID THE TAX BY GOING OUTSIDE THE CITY LIMITS FOR THEIR PURCHASES. HE WOULD ALSO RATHER SEE THE MONEY RAISED GO TOWARD SMART GUN TECHNOLOGY THAN MORE RESEARCH. NOTING THAT HIS ORGANIZATION HAS GIVEN ITS ??CIVIC LEADER OF THE YEAR? AWARD TO BOTH BURGESS AND HOLMES HE SAYS ??THEY??RE DOING THE BEST THEY CAN BUT THEY??RE LIKE HOUDINI IN A STRAIT JACKET -- GETTING OXYGEN AT SEA LEVEL IS SUCCESS.??Ÿ?Ÿ ASKED FOR HIS RESPONSE TO THE CRITICISM BURGESS NOTES THAT THE TAX WILL RAISE $300000 TO $500000 A YEAR TO FUND RESEARCH AND PREVENTION PROGRAMS WHICH IS HARDLY CHUMP CHANGE. AND WHILE HIS FRIEND FASCITELLI ARGUES SMART GUNS ARE PREVENTION ??WE??RE NOT THERE YET? SAYS BURGESS. ALSO IF PEOPLE ARE COUNTING MANY MILLIONS ARE SPENT EACH YEAR IN UNCOMPENSATED CARE AT HARBOR VIEW TO CARE FOR GUNSHOT VICTIMS AND THERE??S NO TAX ANYBODY DARES TO IMAGINE AT THIS POINT THAT WOULD COVER THAT. SEATTLE LIKE EVERY CITY IN AMERICA IS ??AWASH IN GUNS? SAYS HOLMES. ??WE??RE LOOKING TO DO SOMETHING TO HELP REDUCE WHAT IS A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE.? AUTOMOBILE DEATHS ARE SECOND TO GUN DEATHS IN AMERICA FOR THE FIRST TIME IN PART HE SAYS BECAUSE AS A SOCIETY WE TREATED CAR ACCIDENTS AS A PROBLEM WE COULD SOLVE. HE??D LIKE TO SEE THE SAME APPROACH TO GUNS. ??I??M A HAYSEED FROM VIRGINIA? HOLMES SAYS. ??I GO HUNTING I WAS ON THE SKEET AND TRAP TEAM IN COLLEGE. I OWN GUNS. I WANT TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO MY FRIENDS FROM THE RURAL AREAS AND TELL THEM IF YOU WANT AN AR-15 IN THE COUNTRY YOU PROBABLY WON??T BE DOING MUCH DAMAGE.? WASHINGTON IS AN OPEN CARRY STATE BUT WHEN A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WITH LOADED AR-15??S SHOWED UP AT THE STATE??S ANNUAL GAY PRIDE PARADE HOLMES SAYS THAT ??SPOILED THE PARADE AND ALIENATED A LOT OF PEOPLE.? ?Ÿ THAT??S THE KIND OF BEHAVIOR THAT CAN GET STATES WITH A DEEPLY ENGRAINED PRO-GUN CULTURE TO EMBRACE NEW REGULATIONS. WASHINGTON PASSED A BALLOT MEASURE IN 2014 EXPANDING BACKGROUND CHECKS. GUN GROUPS PROTESTED THE NEW LAW BY COMING TO THE STATE CAPITOL IN OLYMPIA BRANDISHING THEIR GUNS AND LOUDLY OBJECTING UNTIL THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR BANNED BRINGING GUNS INTO THE STATE HOUSE. COMMONSENSE GUN LAWS ARE THE NEW REFRAIN AND WHILE THEY DON??T GO FAR ENOUGH FOR SOME PEOPLE THEY LOOK MORE ACHIEVABLE THAN THEY HAVE IN A LONG TIME. MORE REGULATIONS ARE INEVITABLE AND THE QUESTION NOW IS HOW MANY CRACKS WILL IT TAKE IN THE NRA??S FA??ADE FOR ITS CLOAK OF INVINCIBILITY TO CRUMBLE. ,24404.0

LED BY THE GREATEST COACH IN NBA HISTORY GREGG POPOVICH THEY HAVE RETOOLED THEIR ROSTER AROUND AN AGING BUT STILL GOBSMACKINGLY EFFECTIVE TRIO OF SURE-FIRE HALL-OF-FAMERS IN TIM DUNCAN TONY PARKER AND MANU GINOBILI. IN DEFIANCE OF THE SMALLBALL THREE POINT-HAPPY MODERN NBA THEY??VE BECOME A GALACTUS-LIKE PLODDING HALF-COURT DESTROYER OF WORLDS. COUPLE THAT WITH A HISTORICALLY GREAT DEFENSE AND THE SPURS MAY END UP WITH A POINT DIFFERENTIAL (THE AVERAGE POINTS SCORED MINUS POINTS ALLOWED PER GAME) THAT MIGHT END UP SURPASSING EVEN THE 1996 CHICAGO BULLS. ON MONDAY THE CAVALIERS WERE BEATEN TO A PULP BY CURRY ET. AL. 132-98 AND HONESTLY IT WASN??T AS CLOSE AS THE SCORE SUGGESTS. WHILE IT MAY SEEM ODD TO SEND THE COACH PACKING WHEN THE CAVALIERS REMAIN THE PROHIBITIVE FAVORITES TO GET BACK TO THE FINALS THERE ISN??T MUCH THAT THE TEAM CAN DO TO CATCH UP TO THE LEAGUE??S TWIN TITANS SHORT OF A RADICAL ROSTER-RESHUFFLING TRADE WHICH CARRIES A NOT INSIGNIFICANT RISK OF MAKING A FRAUGHT SITUATION FAR WORSE. KEVIN LOVE HAS NEVER REALLY FOUND A WAY TO MESH HIS GAME WITH JAMES?? AND IS AN ATROCIOUS PICK-AND-ROLL DEFENDER??KRYPTONITE FOR ANY TEAM SET TO FACE A SCREEN-HEAVY GOLDEN STATE. KYRIE IRVING IS STILL WORKING HIS WAY BACK INTO FORM FROM A DEVASTATING KNEE INJURY IN GAME ONE OF THE FINALS AND A MOTLEY COLLECTION OF WINGS HAVE ZERO CHANCE OF KEEPING UP WITH EITHER THE WARRIORS?? WHIRRING OFFENSIVE ONSLAUGHT OR THE SPURS?? PRECISE TIKI-TAKA ATTACK. SURE CANNING BLATT??S NOT GOING TO SOLVE ALL OF THE TEAM??S STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS??THOUGH FINDING A BETTER WAY TO INTEGRATE AND UTILIZE THE PIECES THEY DO HAVE WOULD BE A START.?Ÿ BUT IT IS THE ONE MOVE THAT THE TEAM COULD MAKE WITHOUT TOTALLY UPSETTING THE APPLE CART.?Ÿ FAIR OR NOT THIS WILL BE PERCEIVED AS A POWER MOVE ON LEBRON'S PART. AND SHOULD THINGS GO HORRIBLY WRONG MORE THAN ONE CROOKED FINGER IS GOING TO BE POINTED SQUARELY IN HIS DIRECTION. IF THIS RE-JIGGERED VERSION OF HIS ANNOUNCEMENT THAT HE WAS RETURNING TO CLEVELAND IS ANY INDICATION IT??S ALREADY BEGUN. ,7566.0

DESPITE THE FACT THEIR COACH DROVE THE VICTIM TO THE HOSPITAL AND THE SCHOOL SAID IT WAS INVESTIGATING THE TEAM WASN??T SANCTIONED. INSTEAD IT WAS ALLOWED TO PLAY THREE MORE GAMES BEFORE THE SEASON WAS CANCELED. NOW THE COACHES MAY JOIN THEIR PLAYERS BEHIND BARS. ??COACH [ANDRE] MONTGOMERY IS CULPABLE AND SO IS THE ASSISTANT COACH CARL WILLIAMS? A SOURCE CLOSE TO THE INVESTIGATION TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. ??THIS DOESN??T STOP WITH THE KIDS.? IT STARTED IN DECEMBER WHEN THE TEAM TRAVELED THREE HOURS FROM OOLTEWAH TO DESOLATE GATLINBURG FOR A TOURNAMENT. SOME TIME ON THE AFTERNOON OF DEC. 22 MONTGOMERY AND WILLIAMS LEFT THE KIDS UNSUPERVISED. ??THAT??S WHEN FIRST ROUND OF THE ATTACKS HAPPENED? THE SOURCE SAID. ??THE COACHES LEFT THE KIDS FOR TWO HOURS TO GO GROCERY SHOPPING. HOW DO YOU EXPECT THE HOUSE TO BE STANDING AFTER BEING LEFT ALONE FOR SO LONG EVEN WITH THE BEST OF BOYS?? THEY ??STARTED OUT ON THE FRESHMEN IN THE DOWNSTAIRS BASEMENT? A SOURCE CLOSE TO THE VICTIM SAID. ??ALL OF THE FRESHMAN GOT THE POOL CUE....? THAT INCLUDED THE BOY WHO WOULD LATER HAVE ??HOLES IN HIS PANTS? AND NEED SURGERY FOR THE SODOMY. ACCORDING TO THE SOURCE THE BULLIES ARE UPPERCLASSMEN WHO APPARENTLY HAZED ALL OF THE FRESHMEN DURING THEIR OUT-OF-TOWN STAY. LATER ON THAT NIGHT THEY HEADED UPSTAIRS WHERE THE 15-YEAR-OLD VICTIM WAS SOUND ASLEEP AND ALLEGEDLY AMBUSHED HIM. THE FRESHMAN FOUGHT BACK AGAINST THE LICKING WHICH ONLY SERVED TO MAKE THEIR BLOWS EVEN MORE VICIOUS. THIS WAS TOO MUCH FOR THE BOY WHO TOLD COACH MONTGOMERY THAT HE WAS BEING HARASSED. MONTGOMERY ACCORDING TO MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS MARCHED OVER TO THE CABIN AND CHEWED OUT THE ENTIRE TEAM. THIS REPRIMAND SET OFF A SADISTIC TRIO OF BASKETBALL PLAYERS WHO ALLEGEDLY GANGED UP ON THEIR TATTLETALE TEAMMATE WHILE HE WAS SLEEPING. THE BULLIES WERE TWO SOPHOMORES: ONE A ??THICK MUSCULAR? 16-YEAR-OLD ?Ÿ(WHO SOURCES SAID IS 6??1? AND ALSO PLAYS ON THE VARSITY FOOTBALL TEAM) PINNED THE 6??2? ??SCRAWNY? FRESHMAN DOWN WHICH ALLOWED THE TEAM??S 17-YEAR-OLD SENIOR (6??4? 230 POUNDS) TO ALLEGEDLY VIOLATE HIM MULTIPLE SOURCES SAID. A FOURTH TEAMMATE WHIPPED OUT HIS PHONE AND RECORDED THE HORROR MULTIPLE SOURCES CONFIRMED. SOME TIME AFTER THE ASSAULT COACH MONTGOMERY DROVE THE BOY TO LECONTE MEDICAL CENTER. LATER THE GATLINBURG POLICE DEPARTMENT SHOWED UP AND ARRESTED THE ACCUSED THREE BASKETBALL PERPETRATORS. THE BOY WAS INITIALLY RELEASED FROM THE HOSPITAL AND WENT BACK TO THE CABIN WHERE THEN HE COLLAPSED IN A POOL OF BLOOD ACCORDING TO MULTIPLE SOURCES. WHEN THE SEVERITY OF HIS INJURIES WERE REALIZED HE WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE MEDICAL CENTER IN KNOXVILLE TO UNDERGO SURGERY. THE RAPE WAS SO BRUTAL THAT THE TIP OF THE POOL CUE SNAPPED OFF INSIDE HIM AND HAD TO BE SURGICALLY REMOVED SOURCES SAID. THE VICTIM IS RECOVERING FROM A RUPTURED COLON AND A PUNCTURED BLADDER AND PROSTATE INSIDE THE HOSPITAL SOURCES TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. THE BOY HAS REMAINED ACTIVELY COMMUNICATING ON SNAPCHAT AND HAS SHARED SOME DETAILS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT IN THE CABIN. ??THE BOY SAID HIS INJURIES ARE GETTING BETTER AND THAT HE WAS DOING OK? THE SOURCE SAID. TWO OF THE THREE BOYS REMAIN IN A JUVENILE DETENTION FACILITY IN SEVIER COUNTY AND ?ŸA THIRD HAS BEEN RELEASED. THE REASONS FOR SPRINGING HIM ARE UNCLEAR. THE PAIR WHO TAG-TEAMED THE BOY WERE CHARGED WITH ONE COUNT OF AGGRAVATED RAPE AND ONE COUNT OF AGGRAVATED ASSAULT. THE SEVIER COUNTY PROSECUTOR COULD UPGRADE THE CHARGES TO FOUR COUNTS OF AGGRAVATED RAPE FOR EACH BOY AND HIT ALL THREE WITH MULTIPLE COUNTS OF AGGRAVATED ASSAULT. IT WAS HIGHLY LIKELY THAT OTHER TEAMMATES WERE UNAWARE OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING SINCE THE SOURCE CLOSE TO THE VICTIM SAID ??THERE WAS A LOT OF SCREAMING GOING ON.? AND A SOURCE CLOSE TO THE INVESTIGATION TOLD THE DAILY BEAST THE BOYS ??MAY HAVE CHANGED ROLES? BY TAKING TURNS TACKLING THE TEEN INTO SUBMISSION BEFORE WIELDING THE CUE STICK AND PLUNGING IT INTO THE BOY ??THROUGH HIS CLOTHING.? ?Ÿ THE BOY WHO CAPTURED THE ASSAULT ON SNAPCHAT WAS WAS INTERVIEWED BY INVESTIGATORS THIS WEEK BUT ??REFUSED TO SAY WHAT HIS ROLE WAS OR IF THERE WAS A VIDEO RECORDING.? THE TEEN STILL COULD FACE CRIMINAL CHARGES FOR HIS CHRONICLING ROLE IN THE GANG RAPE EVEN DESPITE THE FACT THAT HIS PARENTS INITIALLY CAME CLEAN ABOUT HIS INVOLVEMENT. EERILY THE ALLEGED SENIOR RINGLEADER HAD POSTED ON FACEBOOK WHEN HE WAS A FRESHMAN ATHLETE FOUR YEARS AGO SOME RULES TO AVOID GETTING PRANKED. ??RULE #1: NEVER BE THE FIRST MAN ASLEEP WHEN YOU WITH A GROUP OF PEOPLE #SPLASHDOWN? ??RULE #2: DON'T PRANK EVERYBODY ELSE AROUND YOU AND GO TO SLEEP. #THAT'STRAGIC? AFTER HIS NAME LEAKED ONLINE AS ONE OF THE ACCUSED HIS FACEBOOK ACCOUNT GOT TROLLED. ??YOU'RE A SICK PERSON. WHAT YOU DID WAS FUCKING HORRIBLE? WROTE ONE PERSON. ??YOU'LL GET ALL THE ASS REAMING YOU CAN STAND WHERE YOU'RE HEADED BIG BOY? WROTE ANOTHER. HAZING IS SAID TO ROUTINELY OCCUR IN THE OOLTEWAH LOCKER ROOMS WHERE THE LIGHTS ARE SHUT OFF AND IN THE DARK AND YOUNGER TEAM MEMBERS ARE REPEATEDLY WALLOPED BY THEIR UPPERCLASSMEN TEAMMATES. ??THE PLAYERS CUT THE LIGHTS OUT SO THEY COULDN??T SEE WHO IT WAS THAT PUNCHED THEM AND THERE WAS WRESTLING AND HORSEPLAYING GOING ON? ACCORDING TO A SOURCE CLOSE TO THE VICTIM. COACH MONTGOMERY WOULD BE NEXT DOOR TO THE LOCKER ROOM AND WOULD PUT THE KIBOSH ON THE ASSKICKING. ??THE COACH WOULD HEAR THE RACKET AND TOLD THEM ??STOP HORSING AROUND BEFORE SOMEBODY GETS HURT??? THE SOURCE SAID. COACH MONTGOMERY??S ATTORNEY DENIED HIS CLIENT PRESIDED OVER SUCH BRUTALITY. ?Ÿ ??THERE IS NO CULTURE OF HAZING OR ABUSE AT OOLTEWAH WHERE ATHLETES ARE ENCOURAGED OR TAUGHT TO VIOLATE THE LAW (OR EVEN SIMPLY HUMAN DECENCY) BY TEACHERS ADMINISTRATORS OR COACHES? CURTIS L. BOWE III SAID IN A STATEMENT LAST WEEK. THE SOURCE CLOSE TO THE VICTIM ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WHILE THE ATTACK WAS FEROCIOUS THE BOY HAD MENTIONED THAT IT WASN??T THE FIRST TIME HE??D BEEN HAZED GIVEN THAT THE PRACTICE IS INGRAINED IN OOLTEWAH HIGH??S CULTURE. ??THEY PICK ON THE FRESHMAN STUDENTS BUT YOU NEVER HEARD OF STUFF GOING THIS FAR IN TERMS OF HAZING? THE SOURCE SAID. ??THESE KIDS DID SOMETHING THAT IS HEINOUS AND EVIL TO ME AND HOW CAN YOU EVEN FATHOM THIS KIND OF STUFF?? IF THE RAPE WASN??T STARTLING ENOUGH THEN THE SCHOOL??S SIDESTEPPING SHOULD BE. PRINCIPAL JIM JARVIS MADE LITTLE OF THE GANG RAPE IN AN EMAIL TWO DAYS LATER. ??A VIOLATION OF TEAM POLICY DID OCCUR? HE WROTE FOLLOWED BY ATHLETIC DIRECTOR JESSE NAYADLEY WHO SAID THERE WAS ??NO REASON? TO LOOK INTO THE COACHES AFTER THE ATTACK. SOURCES CLOSE TO THE INVESTIGATION SAY NAYADLEY WILL BE CHARGED WITH FALSE REPORTING AFTER HE DOWNPLAYED THE DIABOLICAL INCIDENT TO INVESTIGATORS. IT WASN??T UNTIL LAST WEDNESDAY MORE THAN TWO WEEKS AFTER THE RAPE THAT THE HAMILTON COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION AND HIGH SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION CANCELED THE VARSITY BASKETBALL SEASON. SUPERINTENDENT RICK SMITH PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED HE WAS GOING TO FORFEIT THE REMAINING 13 GAMES OF THE OWLS?? VARSITY SEASON TO DOUSE THE BASKETBALL BONFIRE. ??SINCE THIS SPECULATION IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE UNTIL THE INVESTIGATION IS CONCLUDED AND SINCE THIS SPECULATION COULD THREATEN THE INTEGRITY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT??S INVESTIGATION I HAVE DECIDED TO END THE TEAM??S 2015-2016 SEASON\ HE READ ALLOWED IN A PREPARED STATEMENT. ?Ÿ SMITH OFFERED UP ??HOW HEARTBROKEN I AM ABOUT THIS? AND THAT HE WAS GOING TO ??DEVELOP THE KIND OF SAFEGUARDS THAT WILL PREVENT THIS FROM EVER HAPPENING AGAIN.? FOR THE SOURCE WHO??S CLOSE TO THE VICTIM THE NONCHALANCE BY COACH MONTGOMERY AND THE SCHOOL SEEMED CALCULATED. ??THE SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS THEY DIDN??T BOTHER TO COME OFF FROM THEIR LITTLE VACATION AND MEET ON THIS THING EARLIER? THE SOURCE WHO REQUESTED ANONYMITY SAID. ??THAT??S TWO WEEKS WE??RE TALKING ABOUT THAT THEY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET A HAND ON IT AND THEY??RE WAITING TILL WEDNESDAY?? THE LIP SERVICE SEEMED TO HAVE TEMPORARILY STALLED THE OUTRAGE SINCE THE TEAM WENT ON TO PLAY THREE GAMES BEFORE THE ADMINISTRATION FINALLY BUCKLED TO PRESSURE. MEANWHILE COACH ??TANK? MONTGOMERY HAS SINCE BEEN BANISHED FROM SETTING FOOT ON ANY HAMILTON COUNTY SCHOOL CAMPUS AND RELEGATED TO SORTING TEXTBOOKS AND TEACHING MATERIALS AT A LOCAL BOOK DEPOSITORY AFTER ADMINISTRATORS SCUTTLED THE REST OF THE TEAM??S GAMES THE DAILY BEAST HAS LEARNED. ??IT??S NOT A SUPERVISOR POSITION? THE SOURCE CLOSE TO THE INVESTIGATION SAID. THE SOURCE ADDED THAT COACHES MONTGOMERY AND WILLIAMS WILL BE CHARGED WITH FAILURE TO REPORT THE RAPE TO AUTHORITIES AND CHARGED WITH CHILD NEGLECT FOR LEAVING 14 PLAYERS ALONE IN A CABIN FOR TWO HOURS. ON JAN. 26 THE CHARGED DEFENDANTS MUST APPEAR IN SEVIER COUNTY JUVENILE COURT ROOM ON JAN. 26 THE SENIOR A SOURCE CLOSE TO THE RAPE CASE NOTED WILL TURN 18 FIVE DAYS LATER. THAT MEANS HE WILL BE TRIED AS AN ADULT IF THE CASE ISN??T RESOLVED BY HIS BIRTHDAY ON JAN. 31. ??AND IF HE??S FOUND GUILTY AND INCARCERATED? THE SOURCE SAID ??HE??LL BE MOVED TO BIG BOY JAIL.? BUT THE SOURCE ADDED THAT THE PROSECUTOR ??IS NOT INCLINED TO TRANSFER THE CASE TO ADULT COURT.? THE HAMILTON COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT REFERRED THE DAILY BEAST TO LAWYER D. SCOTT BENNETT WHO DECLINED TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. ??WE ARE LIMITED BY INSTRUCTIONS FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT NOT TO COMMENT OUT OF CONCERN THAT DOING SO MIGHT COMPROMISE AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION? HE WROTE. HAMILTON COUNTY PROSECUTORS HAVE OPENED A PROBE BACK IN OOLTEWAH TENNESSEE TO DETERMINE IF A HISTORY OF ASSAULTS EXTENDS BEYOND THIS RAPE INCIDENT. ONCE ACCUSATIONS CAME OUT CLAIMING THERE MAY HAVE BEEN MORE THAN ONE HAZING INCIDENT DURING THE TOURNAMENT TRIP TO GATLINBURG DISTRICT ATTORNEY NEAL PINKSTON??S OFFICE SAID IT WOULD DIVE IN. ??WHEN THEY SAID THE HAZING HAPPENED ON THE TRIP WE DIDN??T KNOW IF THAT MEANT GETTING IN THE VAN IN HAMILTON COUNTY OR ARRIVING IN SEVIER COUNTY.? MOST TROUBLING IT SEEMS IS THE COLLATERAL DAMAGE FOR ANYBODY ASSOCIATED WITH THE OOLTEWAH VARSITY SQUAD. WHILE THEIR SEASON OF 13 MORE GAMES WAS OVER THE FRESHMAN TEAMS SCHEDULE WASN'T AFFECTED. BUT ACCORDING TO A SOURCE CLOSE TO THE INVESTIGATION ONE OF THE FRESHMAN PLAYERS WHO TRAVELED TO THE TOURNAMENT AND HAD BEEN A VICTIM OF THE HAZING SHOWED UP TO PLAY IN FRIDAY??S FRESHMAN MATCHUP BUT WAS TURNED AWAY AND TOLD TO HANG UP HITOPS FOR REST OF THE SEASON BECAUSE OF HIS ??ASSOCIATION WITH THE VARSITY TEAM WHICH HAS BEEN SANCTIONED.? YET WEEKS BEFORE THE ALLEGED RAPE A TENNESSEE WATCHDOG ORGANIZATION CALLED UNIFI-ED HAD COMPLETED A BULLYING STUDY AND WHEN REACHING OUT TO STUDENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THEY FOUND THAT BULLYING TOPPED THE LIST OF KIDS?? CONCERNS. ON MONDAY THE NONPROFIT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR ELIZABETH CREWS SENT A LETTER TO THE HAMILTON COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT??S CHAIRMAN AND THE SUPERINTENDENT DETAILING AT LEAST FIVE BLARING WAYS THAT THE DISTRICT WAS ??NOT IN COMPLIANCE? WITH STATE ANTI-BULLYING GUIDELINES. FIRST OOLTEWAH AND OTHER SCHOOLS IN THE DISTRICT HAVE FAILED TO GIVE KIDS DISCRETE WAYS TO REPORT WHEN THEY??VE BULLIED. ??HAVING A SAFE ANONYMOUS WAY TO REPORT IS HUGE? CREWS SAID. ??THEIR SYSTEM HAS NONE OF THAT.? CREWS IS ALSO STUNNED THE DISTRICT REMAINS TONE-DEAF WHEN IT COMES TO CONSEQUENCES ONCE RETALIATION IS INFLICTED AFTER BULLYING ALLEGATIONS GET REPORTED. ??I HAVEN??T SEEN WHERE IT??S WRITTEN DOWN ANYWHERE IN POLICIES PROCEDURES OR IN THE STUDENT HANDBOOKS WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF YOU DO THIS? SHE SAID.

938,10140013.0,2016-01-21T05:01:00+00:00,HOW CITIZENS UNITED GAVE US BERNIE SANDERS AND DONALD TRUMP,THERE WOULD BE NO DONALD TRUMP OR BERNIE SANDERS BOOM WITHOUT CITIZENS UNITED. THE INFAMOUS SUPREME COURT CASE DECIDED SIX YEARS AGO TODAY BANNED LIMITS ON CORPORATE SPENDING IN ELECTIONS. THAT MONEY HAS HEAVILY FAVORED ESTABLISHMENT CANDIDATES EVEN KEEPING SOME ALIVE WHEN THEY WOULD OTHERWISE BE DEAD (LIKE JEB BUSH). NO WONDER THE GRASSROOTS LEFT AND RIGHT GET MORE ANGRY THAT POLITICIANS SEEM TO RESPOND TO BILLIONAIRES?? WHIMS INSTEAD OF THEIR NEEDS. NO WONDER A ??DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST? AND A WEALTHY DEMAGOGUE ARE DOING WELL IN THE POLLS. CITIZENS UNITED DIDN??T JUST UNLEASH CORPORATE SPENDING IT ENABLED THE CREATION OF A WHOLE NEW VEHICLE FOR INFLUENCING ELECTIONS: SUPER PACS. THESE PSEUDO-CORPORATIONS DON??T HAVE TO DISCLOSE THEIR DONORS AND CAN SPEND UNLIMITED AMOUNTS ON ELECTIONS AS LONG AS THEY??RE NOT OFFICIALLY COORDINATING WITH SPECIFIC CANDIDATES (WHICH HAS TURNED OUT TO BE A JOKE). ONCE THE FLOODGATES WERE OPENED SUPER PACS DELUGED LOCAL AND NATIONAL ELECTIONS WITH MONEY. IN 2014??S SENATE RACES OUTSIDE GROUPS SPENT $486 MILLION TWICE THE AMOUNT THEY SPENT IN 2010 BEFORE CITIZENS UNITED. IN TEN ELECTIONS TRACKED BY THE LEFT-LEANING BRENNAN CENTER FOR JUSTICE SUPER PACS ACTUALLY SPENT MORE THAN CANDIDATES DID BY 47-41 PERCENT. NOT ONLY IS THERE MORE MONEY IN POLITICS BUT IT IS COMING FROM FEWER PEOPLE. IN 1980 THE TOP .01 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION CONTRIBUTED 15 PERCENT OF TOTAL POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS. IN THE 2014 ELECTION CYCLE THE TOP 100 DONORS GAVE NEARLY AS MUCH AS EVERYONE ELSE IN THE COUNTRY PUT TOGETHER. BETWEEN 2010 AND 2014 195 DONORS FUNDED 60 PERCENT OF SUPER PAC SPENDING ACCORDING TO A NEW REPORT PUBLISHED BY THE BRENNAN CENTER. THEY AREN??T THE TOP 1 PERCENT OR EVEN THE TOP 1 PERCENT OF ONE PERCENT??THEY??RE THE TOP .00013 PERCENT. THE RADICAL CHANGE IN CAMPAIGN FINANCING HAS RADICALLY INCREASED THE POWER OF THE MOST POWERFUL CONTRIBUTING TO THE ALIENATION OF EVERYONE ELSE. WHILE THIS ALL MAY SOUND LIKE A ??FEEL THE BERN? COMMERCIAL THE EFFECTS OF CITIZENS UNITED HAVE BEEN FELT ON THE RIGHT AS MUCH AS ON THE LEFT. TAKE THE CASE OF MITCH MCCONNELL LEADER OF THE SENATE GOP AND A PERCEIVED MODERATE WIDELY LOATHED BY THE TEA PARTY. SURE MCCONNELL??S TEA PARTY CHALLENGER IN THE 2014 PRIMARY MATT BEVIN GOT ABOUT $1 MILLION FROM OUTSIDE GROUPS LIKE THE SENATE CONSERVATIVES FUND THE MADISON PROJECT AND FREEDOMWORKS. BEVIN??S CAMPAIGN ITSELF RAISED ABOUT $4 MILLION. BUT SUPER PACS SUPPORTING MCCONNELL RAISED $10 MILLION INCLUDING $300000 FROM THE COUNTRY??S LARGEST PRIVATELY OWNED COAL COMPANY MURRAY ENERGY COMPANY. THE ??KENTUCKIANS FOR STRONG LEADERSHIP? SUPER PAC SPENT $2 MILLION ON TV ADS ALONE. SUPER PAC CASH WENT TO A WILDLY NEGATIVE AD CAMPAIGN AGAINST BEVIN INCLUDING NOT JUST THE USUAL LIES AND MISCHARACTERIZATIONS BUT BOGUS MAILINGS THAT LOOKED LIKE OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT NOTICES DEFAMING HIM. ALL THIS IN ADDITION TO THE $21 MILLION MCCONNELL RAISED DIRECTLY HALF OF WHICH HE SPENT ON THE PRIMARY. BEVIN WAS CRUSHED. WHEN YOU ADD UP SPENDING IN MCCONNELL??S GENERAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN AGAINST A DEMOCRAT IT??S ESTIMATED THAT THIS SINGLE ELECTION SAW MORE THAN $100 MILLION SPENT. IT??S HARD TO SAY SUPER PAC MONEY WON THE DAY FOR MCCONNELL BUT HE SEEMS TO THINK IT DID: LAST YEAR MCCONNELL STARTED A NEW SUPER PAC (HEADED BY A FORMER AIDE BUT OF COURSE OFFICIALLY INDEPENDENT) TO HELP SENATE REPUBLICANS IN 2016. IT??S ALREADY RAISED $5 MILLION. THE WORST PART OF CITIZENS UNITED IN RUMSFELDIAN TERMS IS THE KNOWN UNKNOWNS. IN 2012 ALMOST $320 MILLION WAS SPENT WITHOUT DISCLOSURE OF DONORS. ONLY 40 PERCENT OF ??OUTSIDE SPENDING? WAS DISCLOSED IN 2012 DOWN FROM ALMOST 100 PERCENT IN 2004. THIS ISN??T JUST BIG MONEY: IT??S BIG DARK MONEY. DARK MONEY IN SENATE ELECTIONS HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED BETWEEN 2010 AND 2014 ACCORDING TO THE BRENNAN CENTER AND THE WINNERS OF 11 OF THE MOST COMPETITIVE RACES IN 2014 GOT TWICE AS MUCH OF IT AS THE LOSERS. ALL IN ALL OF THE $1 BILLION THAT OUTSIDE SPENDERS PUT INTO SENATE ELECTIONS OVER THE LAST THREE CYCLES $485 MILLION CAME FROM MYSTERY DONORS. SO DESPITE ALL THE STATISTICS WE HAVE NO CLEAR SENSE OF WHICH ELECTIONS HAVE BEEN SWAYED BY SUPER PACS AND ANONYMOUS DONORS. IN MANY CASES WE DON??T EVEN KNOW WHO HAS GIVEN WHAT TO WHOM. IT??S A MYSTERY BY LAW. SHORT OF A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT THERE??S NOT MUCH THAT CAN BE DONE. IRONICALLY THE SUPREME COURT THAT WILL ONE DAY HEAR A CHALLENGE TO CITIZENS UNITED WILL BE NOMINATED AND CONFIRMED BY THE POLITICIANS THAT BIG DARK MONEY SWEPT INTO POWER. AND EVEN IF THAT COURT IS PERSUADED THAT CITIZENS UNITED HAS TURNED THE U.S. INTO A PLUTOCRACY AND OVERTURNS THE CASE THE PROBLEM GOES DEEPER. AS THE NEW BRENNAN CENTER REPORT INDICATES THE COURT HAS ISSUED A SERIES OF OPINIONS??USUALLY BY A 5-4 MARGIN??THAT HAVE CREATED THE CURRENT MESS. IN FACT THE COURT WOULD NEED TO GO ALL THE WAY BACK TO 1976??S BUCKLEY V. VALEO WHEN IT REACHED TWO TERRIBLE CONCLUSIONS. FIRST THAT MONEY IS A FORM OF SPEECH AND SECOND THAT RESTRICTIONS ON THAT ??SPEECH? COULD ONLY BE FOR EXTREMELY NARROW REASONS LIKE PREVENTING CORRUPTION. A HOST OF TERRIBLE COURT DECISIONS HAVE SPRUNG FORTH FROM THESE TWO HOLDINGS: ENSURING A FREE AND FAIR ELECTION DOESN??T JUSTIFY LIMITING SPEECH LIMITING CORPORATIONS BUT NOT INDIVIDUALS ISN??T ALLOWED MONEY IS SPEECH CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE. OVER 40 YEARS NOT JUST SIX THE COURT HAS TAKEN A LAISSEZ FAIRE ATTITUDE NOT SEEN SINCE THE ANTI-NEW-DEAL LOCHNER ERA HAMSTRINGING ANY EFFORTS TO CURB THE EFFECTS OF BIG DARK MONEY. THE RESULT HAS BEEN NOT JUST A CROP OF ESTABLISHMENT CANDIDATES PROPPED UP BY BILLIONS OF CORPORATE DOLLARS BUT THEIR RADICAL CHALLENGERS AS WELL. ,10971.0

YANKED OUT OF HIS BED BY LEBANESE POLICE IN A DAWN RAID ON AUGUST 9 2012 WITHIN ONE DAY THE FOUR-TIME CABINET MINISTER HAD CONFESSED TO CONSPIRING WITH SYRIAN OFFICIALS UP TO AND INCLUDING PRESIDENT BASHAR AL-ASSAD HIMSELF TO BLOW UP SUNNI MUSLIM LEBANESE POLITICIANS RELIGIOUS FIGURES AND BYSTANDERS AT RAMADAN FAST-BREAKING GATHERINGS. THANKS TO A SERIES OF VIDEOS LEAKED TO THE MEDIA A FLABBERGASTED NATION COULD WATCH WITH THEIR OWN EYES AS SAMAHA A VETERAN POLITICIAN AND HOUSEHOLD NAME PRODUCED BAGS OF EXPLOSIVES TIMERS AND DETONATORS FROM HIS CAR AND SPOKE CASUALLY OF PLANS TO MURDER AN MP MEMBERS OF THE MP??S FAMILY AND SENIOR CLERICS (??LET THEM BE BURIED?) WITH EXPRESS INDIFFERENCE TO ADDITIONAL CIVILIAN CASUALTIES (??WHOEVER DEPARTS ALONG THE WAY DEPARTS!?). THERE SEEMED NO CONCEIVABLE WAY OUT OF A SEVERE PUNISHMENT AND AT HIS FORMAL INDICTMENT IN FEBRUARY 2013 THE JUDGE SOUGHT THE DEATH PENALTY. AND YET ON THE 14TH OF THIS MONTH SAMAHA WALKED OUT OF LEBANON??S RAYHANIEH PRISON AND RETURNED TO HIS FAMILY HOME IN BEIRUT AN ALMOST-FREE MAN RELEASED ON $100000 BAIL. DESPITE THE GRAVITY OF THE CHARGES BROUGHT AGAINST HIM IN 2013??PLOTTING TO CARRY OUT ??TERRORIST ACTS? USING EXPLOSIVE DEVICES PLANNING ASSASSINATIONS OF POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS FIGURES INSTIGATING SECTARIAN CONFLICT AND FORMING AN ARMED GROUP??HE WAS SENTENCED TO JUST FOUR AND A HALF YEARS?? IMPRISONMENT IN MAY 2015 IN A DECISION LEGAL OBSERVERS SAID REEKED OF SYRIAN INFLUENCE OVER THE JUDICIARY. AN APPEAL IS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY AT THE COURT OF CASSATION BUT SINCE A ??JAIL YEAR? IS ONLY NINE MONTHS IN LEBANON SAMAHA HAS ALREADY FULLY SERVED HIS SENTENCE IN THE THREE YEARS AND FIVE MONTHS SINCE HIS INCARCERATION. UNLESS THE APPEALS COURT CHANGES THE VERDICT THE US-SANCTIONED SPECIALLY DESIGNATED GLOBAL TERRORIST IS OUT FOR GOOD. THIS HAS CAUSED RATHER AN OUTRAGE IN LEBANON AND NOT JUST FOR THE OBVIOUS REASONS. TO MANY LEBANESE SAMAHA??S ARREST HELD ALMOST UNIQUE POLITICAL EVEN EMOTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE. FOR ONE THING HE WAS FAR WEIGHTIER A CATCH THAN HIS SECOND-RATE MINISTERIAL AND ONETIME PARLIAMENTARY CAREER BESPOKE. IN A COUNTRY WITH NO SHORTAGE OF DEPENDABLE SYRIAN ALLIES (THE KIND WORD FOR THEM) SAMAHA WAS A COHORT OF RARE CALIBER. PART OF A CHRISTIAN SPLINTER GROUP THAT BROKE AWAY FROM THE ANTI-SYRIAN PHALANGISTS TO EMBRACE DAMASCUS IN 1985 SAMAHA CAME TO BE AN INTIMATE CONFIDANT OF BOTH PRESIDENT HAFEZ AL-ASSAD AND HIS SON AND SUCCESSOR BASHAR. VALUED ESPECIALLY FOR HIS WESTERN CONNECTIONS HE WAS CREDITED WITH HELPING ARRANGE THE LATTER??S STATE VISIT IN 2008 TO ATTEND BASTILLE DAY FESTIVITIES IN PARIS AS THE ESTEEMED GUEST OF PRESIDENT SARKOZY. THE STORY GOES THAT EVEN AFTER LEBANON??S OWN PRESIDENTIAL ENTOURAGE TURNED UP THE SAME WEEK IN PARIS SAMAHA REMAINED WITH THE SYRIAN DELEGATION. COMPOUNDING THE MAGNITUDE OF HIS ARREST WAS THE LAW OF PUBLIC LIFE IN LEBANON WHICH HOLDS THAT THOSE WHO DISPLEASE THE ASSADS APPRECIABLY REDUCE THEIR CHANCES OF DYING A NATURAL DEATH. THIS LONG-OBSERVED STATISTICAL PHENOMENON DATING BACK AT LEAST TO THE 1977 ASSASSINATION OF LEFTIST LEADER KAMAL JUMBLATT WAS PARTICULARLY NOTICEABLE IN THE RUN-UP TO AND AFTERMATH OF THE SYRIAN ARMY??S FORCED WITHDRAWAL FROM LEBANON IN 2005??ITSELF PROMPTED BY THE ENORMOUS CAR BOMB ON VALENTINE??S DAY OF THAT YEAR WHICH OBLITERATED THE PRIME MINISTER RAFIQ AL-HARIRI ALONG WITH 21 OTHERS. FROM 2004 TO THE PRESENT DAY AT LEAST ELEVEN HIGH-PROFILE FOES OF DAMASCUS HAVE PERISHED BY THE SAME OR SIMILAR MEANS WHILE FOUR SURVIVED ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS WITH GRAVE WOUNDS. AMONG THE VICTIMS WAS BRIG. GEN. WISSAM AL-HASSAN HEAD OF THE VERY POLICE UNIT THAT BUSTED SAMAHA SLAIN BY A CAR BOMB OUTSIDE WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS A ??SAFE?? HOUSE TWO MONTHS AFTER SAMAHA??S ARREST. THOUGH FEW WERE EVER IN DOUBT AS TO WHO STOOD BEHIND THIS GRUESOME LIQUIDATION CAMPAIGN EVIDENCE OF INCONTESTABLE CONCRETENESS COULD NEVER QUITE BE PROCURED. THE CAPTURE IN FLAGRANTE OF SO SYMBOLIC A PERSONAGE AS SAMAHA??SEEN TELLING THE POLICE INFORMANT ON CAMERA: ??THERE ARE [ONLY] TWO PEOPLE WHO KNOW [ABOUT THE PLAN]??ALI [MAMLUK DIRECTOR OF SYRIA??S NATIONAL SECURITY BUREAU] AND THE PRESIDENT???LOOKED FOR A MOMENT LIKE IT MIGHT CHANGE THAT. INSTEAD HIS RELEASE HAS ONLY BROUGHT HOME HOW VERY LITTLE HAS CHANGED IN THE LAST DECADE. MP MARWAN HAMADE WAS THE FIRST OF THE BATCH TO BE TARGETED IN 2004 WHEN A MERCEDES EXPLODED AS HE DROVE PAST IT JUST OFF BEIRUT??S ICONIC CORNICHE. THAT ONLY ONE OF THE THREE IN THE CAR??POLICE ESCORT SERGEANT GHAZI BOU KAROUM??LOST HIS LIFE WAS CONSIDERED A LUCKY ESCAPE. AS NICHOLAS BLANFORD DOCUMENTS IN HIS BOOK KILLING MR. LEBANON THE 65-YEAR-OLD HAMADE BROKE ALL OF HIS RIBS AS WELL AS HIS FOOT NEEDED 450 STITCHES IN HIS HEAD SUFFERED BRAIN HEMORRHAGES AND BURNS AND TOOK THE BEST PART OF A YEAR TO RECOVER. AS HE RECOUNTED IN 2014 WHILE TESTIFYING AT THE SPECIAL TRIBUNAL FOR LEBANON (STL) ESTABLISHED IN THE HAGUE TO INVESTIGATE HARIRI??S ASSASSINATION SYRIA??S MILITARY INTELLIGENCE CHIEF IN LEBANON RUSTOM GHAZALEH HASTILY ORDERED THE POLICE INVESTIGATION INTO HAMADE??S CASE CLOSED ON THE GROUNDS THAT RESPONSIBILITY HAD TO LIE EITHER WITH ISRAEL OR HAMADE HIMSELF. SPEAKING TO THE DAILY BEAST ABOUT SAMAHA??S RELEASE HAMADE SAID IT ONLY REAFFIRMED HIS GRATITUDE FOR BEING INCLUDED AMONG THE AUXILIARY CASES FALLING UNDER THE STL??S MANDATE EVEN IF NO INDICTMENT HAS YET BEEN ISSUED IN THE HAGUE. ??I SAID TO MYSELF ??WELL WE DID WELL TO FIGHT TO GET A SPECIAL TRIBUNAL ON LEBANON BECAUSE EVEN IF IT??S A SLOW-PACED OPERATION AT LEAST WE??RE NOT UNDER THE PRESSURE OF LOCAL INTERESTS AND HEZBOLLAH OR THE SYRIANS??

HASSAN THE LATE MASTERMIND OF THE SAMAHA BUST] WENT ABOUT CATCHING SAMAHA WITH AUDIO AND VIDEO RECORDINGS WAS UNPARALLELED IN THE HISTORY OF LEBANON? SAID CHATAH. ??HASSAN AND THE PEOPLE AROUND HIM IN THE [POLICE] WORKED TIRELESSLY TO DO THIS THE RIGHT WAY AND DESPITE THE OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE AND CLEAR SECURITY THREAT HE POSES THE JUDGE RELEASED HIM ON BAIL. THAT CAPRICIOUSNESS OF INJUSTICE IS SCARY WHEN YOU CONSIDER HOW IT HAS PERMEATED OUR INSTITUTIONS AND GOVERNMENT.? AT THE SAME TIME CHATAH ECHOED THE FEELINGS OF IMPOTENCE AND DESPAIR EXPRESSED BY COUNTLESS LEBANESE IN PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS RECALLING THAT WHILE HE ADMIRED THE YOUNG DEMONSTRATORS PROTESTING OUTSIDE SAMAHA??S RESIDENCE AND ELSEWHERE IN THE COUNTRY SINCE HIS RELEASE A SENSE OF FUTILITY STOPPED HIM FROM JOINING THEM. ??I FEEL HELPLESS. WHEN WE DEMONSTRATE NOBODY LISTENS. WHEN WE APPLAUD RESPONSIBLE PEOPLE FOR CONDUCTING THOROUGH INVESTIGATIONS AND LAWFUL ARRESTS THEY ARE KILLED. WHEN WE PUT OUR FAITH IN THE JUDGES AND COURTS THEY SHOW TOTAL DISREGARD FOR THE LAW. I AM BEYOND DISAPPOINTED IT??S LIKE WE HAVE COME TO EXPECT THIS CAPRICIOUSNESS. IT??S THE BANALITY OF INJUSTICE. WE ARE SO JADED AS A COUNTRY THAT WHEN A MURDERER IS SO OBVIOUSLY CAUGHT RED-HANDED IT JUST SLIDES BY.? ABOVE ALL CHATAH DESCRIBED SAMAHA??S RELEASE AS THE LOSS OF PERHAPS THE LAST CHANCE TO OBTAIN SOME MODICUM OF JUSTICE FOR THE LONG SERIES OF UNPUNISHED BOMBINGS FROM THAT OF HAMADE THROUGH HARIRI TO ??MY FATHER AND MANY OTHERS IN BETWEEN.? ??[THE ARREST OF SAMAHA] WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT WAS DONE THROUGH THOROUGH INVESTIGATIONS THROUGH PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS AND BEST OF ALL IT WAS PREEMPTED NO ONE HAD TO DIE.? SAID CHATAH. ??PERSONALLY IF JUSTICE INSTITUTIONAL JUSTICE CAN BE METED OUT FOR JUST ONE OF THE PEOPLE ASSASSINATED JUST ONCE I WILL FEEL A LITTLE BETTER. I WILL SLEEP A LITTLE BIT BETTER AT NIGHT.? ADDING TO THE BITTER TASTE FOR MANY IS HEZBOLLAH WHO IS NORMALLY EXCELLENT AT KEEPING A GRUDGE BUT HAS PRONOUNCED IT HIGH TIME TO PUT THE EPISODE TO BED AND ESSENTIALLY ASKED WHAT THE FUSS WAS ABOUT ANYWAY. ??THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY LEGAL JUSTIFICATION FOR [SAMAHA??S] DETENTION TO CONTINUE? SAID MP MUHAMMAD RAAD HEAD OF HEZBOLLAH??S PARLIAMENTARY BLOC. THOSE OBJECTING TO HIS RELEASE WERE MERE RABBLE-ROUSERS GUILTY OF ??PETULANCE? AND ??MALICIOUSNESS.? RAAD??S REMARKS WERE RIDICULED BY TV SATIRIST NADIM KOTEICH WHO WITH A MOCK SHRUG MIMICKED: ??FOUR YEARS IS ENOUGH WHAT DID THE GUY DO? MOVED EXPLOSIVES FROM SYRIA COMMISSIONED BY A FOREIGN STATE TO BLOW THEM UP IN HIS COUNTRY AND KILL PEOPLE? WHAT??S THE ISSUE?? (KOTEICH HAD TO CHANGE HIS FILMING LOCATION AFTER RECEIVING DEATH THREATS IN 2014??READERS MAY PERHAPS PERCEIVE AN EMERGING PATTERN.) YET BEYOND HEZBOLLAH ALONE IS THE BROADER REALIZATION THAT RATHER THAN THE DAYS OF ASSAD??S HOLD OVER LEBANON FADING INTO THE PAST??AS SO MANY HAD HOPED IN 2005 AND THEN AGAIN IN 2011??THEY ARE IF ANYTHING LOOMING EVER LARGER IN THE FUTURE. LOOKING BEYOND LEBANON??S FRONTIERS WHICH IS WHERE MOST OF BEIRUT??S VITAL POLITICS ARE DECIDED THOSE LEBANESE ASPIRING FOR A GENUINELY SOVEREIGN AND INDEPENDENT NATION HAVE FEWER REASONS THAN EVER FOR OPTIMISM. THAT THE IRAN DEAL IS LIKELY TO STRENGTHEN HEZBOLLAH IS A FACT ADMITTED EVEN BY ITS CHIEF ARCHITECT AND DEFENDER PRESIDENT OBAMA. THANKS TO IRANIAN AND NOW RUSSIAN INTERVENTION TO SUPPORT ASSAD MILITARILY AS WELL AS A GRADUAL BUT UNMISTAKABLE AMERICAN ABANDONMENT OF ITS ASSAD-MUST-GO POLICY THE AUTOCRAT SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY ONCE COMPARED TO HITLER HASN??T LOOKED SO COMFORTABLY SEATED IN HALF A DECADE. THOSE READING THE WINDS HAVE ALREADY STARTED TO ACT: LAST MONDAY ONE OF LEBANON??S LAST ANTI-ASSAD HAWKS SAMIR GEAGEA STUNNED SUPPORTERS AND CRITICS ALIKE BY OFFICIALLY ENDORSING HIS MORTAL FOE OF THREE DECADES HEZBOLLAH ALLY MICHEL AOUN FOR PRESIDENT. THIS NEEDN??T MEAN LEBANON IS WHOLLY LOST TO SYRIAN HEGEMONY ALL OVER AGAIN. FOR ONE THING VARIOUS POWERBROKERS INCLUDING THE COUNTRY??S MAIN SUNNI PARTY ARE RIGIDLY ALIGNED AGAINST AOUN??S CANDIDACY. IT DOES MEAN HOWEVER THAT WHEN SAMAHA TOLD REPORTERS IN HIS LIVING ROOM UPON HIS RELEASE THAT HE PLANS NOW TO CONTINUE HIS PRIOR ??POLITICAL WORK AND ACTIVITY? THERE IS NO OBVIOUS REASON FOR ANYONE NOT TO TAKE HIS WORDS WITH THE ABSOLUTE AND UTMOST SERIOUSNESS. ,7736.0
369,9773683.0,2016-01-09T05:01:00+00:00,NETFLIX WITHOUT BORDERS: WHY THE STREAMING SERVICE GOING GLOBAL IS A BIG DEAL ,SO WHAT DOES IT REALLY MEAN FOR NETFLIX TO GO GLOBAL? FOR GLOBETROTTING AMERICANS LIKE ME IT??S A MATTER OF CONVENIENCE. NOW IF I??M VISITING RELATIVES IN TAIWAN OVER THE HOLIDAYS AND FEEL LIKE MAINLINING COMFORT-FOOD TV RATHER THAN MAKING THE EFFORT TO INTERACT WITH MY FAMILY I CAN SURF DIRECTLY TO NETFLIX AND CUE UP ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THE RIGMAROLE OF A VPN. (CUE MASTER OF NONE JOKES ABOUT WATCHING DEXTER IN INDIA.) NETFLIX ISN??T DOING IT FOR ME THOUGH??THEY??VE ALREADY GOT MY SUBSCRIPTION FEE. THEY??RE DOING IT FOR MY COUSINS IN TAIWAN WHO THEORETICALLY COULD BE NETFLIX SUBSCRIBERS ALREADY IF THEY WANTED TO BUT WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE RIGMAROLE OF USING A SERVICE LIKE A VPN OR DNS PROXY TO TRICK NETFLIX INTO THINKING THEY??RE IN THE UNITED STATES BEFORE THEY COULD USE IT. IT SETS UP AN INTERESTING SITUATION BECAUSE IN THEORY NETFLIX ISN??T ACTUALLY GIVING PEOPLE ANYTHING THEY DIDN??T ALREADY HAVE A WAY TO GET. VPNS AND DNS PROXY SERVICES ARE NUMEROUS AND DON??T REQUIRE MUCH TECHNICAL SKILL TO USE. THEY??RE ARGUABLY TECHNICALLY ILLEGAL??NEW ZEALAND ISPS ARE CURRENTLY EMBROILED IN A LEGAL BATTLE OVER HOW ILLEGAL THEY ARE??BUT THAT DOESN??T STOP ANYONE FROM USING THEM. MEDIA SUPERFANS ABROAD WHO REALLY DESPERATELY WANT TO SEE MAKING A MURDERER OR JESSICA JONES HAVE ALREADY SEEN IT. INDEED ALL NETFLIX IS DOING IS LIFTING A RESTRICTION THAT THEY INSTITUTED IN THE FIRST PLACE. FROM A TECHNICAL PERSPECTIVE STREAMING JESSICA JONES OVER THE WEB TO AUCKLAND NEW ZEALAND ISN??T ANY MORE DIFFICULT THAN STREAMING IT TO LOS ANGELES CALIFORNIA. THAT??S THE WHOLE POINT OF THE WORLD WIDE WEB AND OF THE INTERNET AS A WHOLE: TO BE A DECENTRALIZED NETWORK WHERE ANY NODE IN THE SYSTEM CAN ACCESS ANY OTHER. NETFLIX HAS TO TAKE EXTRA STEPS??STEPS THAT COST MONEY AND RESOURCES??TO DETERMINE BASED ON YOUR IP ADDRESS WHAT PART OF THE WORLD YOUR COMPUTER IS IN AND BLOCK YOU FROM DOWNLOADING THEIR CONTENT IF YOU??RE IN THE WRONG PLACE. THIS IS STILL THE CASE EVEN AFTER THEY??VE ??GONE GLOBAL???ISRAELIS STILL CAN??T WATCH ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK SINGAPOREANS CAN??T WATCH HOUSE OF CARDS AND ONLY CANADIANS GET EARLY ACCESS TO A STREAMING VERSION OF STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS. IRONICALLY FOR PEOPLE WHO WERE ALREADY TECH-SAVVY ENOUGH TO WATCH NETFLIX OVERSEAS NETFLIX GOING GLOBAL WILL ACTUALLY MAKE IT HARDER FOR ISRAELIS TO WATCH ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK. NETFLIX PRECEDED THEIR NEW YEAR??S ANNOUNCEMENT OF GOING GLOBAL BY OVER CHRISTMAS WEEKEND QUIETLY TAKING STEPS TO MAKE VPNS HARDER TO USE ON THEIR SERVICE PRESUMABLY TO INCREASE THE INCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE TO SIGN UP FOR LEGITIMATE OVERSEAS NETFLIX ACCOUNTS. IN OTHER WORDS CONTENT THAT WAS IN ALL PRACTICAL TERMS READILY AVAILABLE FOR ANYONE WHO KNEW HOW TO GET IT WILL NOW ACTUALLY BE HARDER FOR SOME PEOPLE TO GET. ENTER THE TANGLED LEGAL DEBATE OVER GEOBLOCKING. GEOBLOCKING IS JUST ANOTHER ONE OF THE MANY PERVERSE SITUATIONS CREATED BY AN ANALOGUE MARKETPLACE THAT HAS YET TO CATCH UP TO A DIGITAL WORLD. IT??S SIMILAR TO THE CONCEPT OF MEDIA PIRACY. THE WAY WE BUY BOOKS MOVIES MUSIC AND THE LIKE USED TO DEPEND ON THE IDEA OF MEDIA COMING IN PHYSICAL FORMS??BUNDLES OF PAGES MAGNETIC TAPES VINYL DISCS??THAT WERE COSTLY TO REPLICATE. BUT GIVE EVERYONE COMPUTERS THAT AS A MATTER OF COURSE MAKE PERFECT COPIES OF ANY INFORMATION THEY PROCESS ALL THE TIME AS PART OF THE INHERENT NATURE OF PROCESSING IT AND THE SYSTEM FALLS APART. YOU??RE REDUCED TO ASKING PEOPLE TO PRETEND THAT THE MP3 ON THEIR COMPUTER WHICH THEIR COMPUTER CAN MAKE THOUSANDS OF COPIES OF IN SECONDS WORKS LIKE A PHYSICAL VINYL RECORD??OR ELSE YOUR WHOLE ECONOMY FOR COMPENSATING ARTISTS STOPS WORKING. IT??S A SITUATION THAT SIMPLY FEELS INTRINSICALLY PERVERSE AND CAN??T BE ENFORCED WITHOUT THE CREEPY SITUATION OF GIVING THE CORPORATIONS THAT SELL YOU MUSIC CONTROL OVER THE COMPUTER YOU OWN. IT LEADS TO ENDLESS IDEOLOGICAL BATTLES OVER WHAT ??OWNING? INFORMATION EVEN MEANS IN THE FIRST PLACE AND WHAT THE MORAL OBLIGATION TO PAY FOR YOUR ENTERTAINMENT REALLY IS. GEOBLOCKING TAKES IT A LEVEL BEYOND THAT. BACK WHEN MOVIES AND TV SHOWS CAME IN CANISTERS OF FILM THAT HAD TO BE SHIPPED FROM PLACE TO PLACE THE DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS FOR MOVIES AND TV WERE BUILT UP SEPARATELY COUNTRY BY COUNTRY. THE RIGHTS TO SELL MOVIES AND TV SHOWS WERE LIKEWISE SPLIT UP IN CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS REGION BY REGION COUNTRY BY COUNTRY AND PARCELING OUT THOSE ??FOREIGN RIGHTS? REMAINS A HIGH-STAKES ENDEAVOR FOR PEOPLE NEGOTIATING CONTRACTS. EVEN IN THE WORLD OF BOOK PUBLISHING??WHICH HAS FAR FEWER MOVING PARTS THAN RELEASING A FEATURE FILM??THE IDEA OF COLLAPSING FOREIGN DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS INTO ONE SET OF ??GLOBAL RIGHTS? WOULD BE A SEISMIC SHOCK TO HOW BUSINESS IS DONE. SO FROM THE BUSINESS SIDE OF THINGS THE CREATION OF THIS MAGICAL GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK WHERE SOMEONE IN AUSTRALIA CAN BROWSE THE EXACT SAME WORLD WIDE WEB AS SOMEONE IN HUNGARY IS A PROBLEM??AND CREATING ARTIFICIALLY SEPARATED ??DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS? BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES MAKES PERFECT SENSE (EVEN THOUGH IN REALITY THERE??S ONLY ONE DISTRIBUTION NETWORK NOW THE INTERNET). FROM THE CUSTOMER??S SIDE OF THINGS IT??S WORSE THAN ANTI-PIRACY PROVISIONS. AT LEAST ANTI-PIRACY PROVISIONS ARE ABOUT GETTING YOU TO PAY MONEY FOR SOMETHING YOU WANT TO WATCH. GEOBLOCKING IS ABOUT PREVENTING YOU FROM USING THE COMPUTER YOU OWN AND THE INTERNET CONNECTION YOU PAY FOR TO ACCESS A STREAMING SERVICE YOU ALSO PAY FOR AND WATCH A MOVIE OR TV SHOW WITH ALL ITS EMBEDDED ADVERTISING INTACT JUST BECAUSE YOU??RE LIVING IN THE WRONG COUNTRY AT THE TIME. THE EARLIER GENERATION OF GEOBLOCKING REGION-LOCKING ON INTERNATIONALLY DISTRIBUTED DVDS SPARKED A SIMILAR CUSTOMER REVOLT AND AN UNDERGROUND TRADE IN REGION-FREE DVD PLAYERS AND ??REGION 0? DVDS THAT WASN??T SO MUCH RESOLVED AS MOOTED ONCE DVDS WERE ECLIPSED BY STREAMING SERVICES. IT??S AN INTERESTING SITUATION. AS LONG AS TRADITIONAL DISTRIBUTION CONTINUES TO EXIST ALONGSIDE INTERNET DISTRIBUTION DISTRIBUTORS HAVE A LEGITIMATE INCENTIVE TO CONTROL THE LATTER??DVD REGION-LOCKING STARTED BECAUSE DISTRIBUTORS DIDN??T WANT THE DVD OF A HOLLYWOOD MOVIE TO BE AVAILABLE IN EUROPE WHEN THAT MOVIE WAS STILL JUST OPENING UP IN EUROPEAN CINEMAS. SIMILARLY THE RIGHTS TO DISTRIBUTE ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK IN ISRAEL ARE THEORETICALLY WORTH SOMETHING IF THEY BECOME WORTHLESS BECAUSE EVERYONE IN ISRAEL IS STREAMING ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK THROUGH A VPN ANYWAY THEN THE CREATORS HAVE THEORETICALLY LOST MONEY. (HOW MUCH MONEY THEY??VE REALLY LOST IS UP FOR DEBATE JUST LIKE THE DEBATE OVER HOW MUCH REVENUE ARTISTS REALLY LOSE DUE TO PIRACY.) AND YET IT STILL SEEMS AT THE END OF THE DAY RIDICULOUS TO KEEP PEOPLE IN A COUNTRY WHO HAVE MONEY AND WANT TO BUY SOMETHING FROM BUYING IT JUST BECAUSE THE RIGHT MIDDLEMEN AREN??T IN PLACE. AMERICAN CUSTOMERS AREN??T GOING TO STAND FOR BEING TOLD THEY HAVE TO PAY TO WATCH THE OLYMPICS IN CANADA BECAUSE OF BEHIND-THE-SCENES WHEELING-AND-DEALING NOT WHEN CHANGING YOUR IP ADDRESS TO A CANADIAN ONE TAKES FIVE MINUTES?? WORTH OF WORK. AFTER ALL THAT WAS THE SAME COMMERCIAL LOGIC BEHIND KILLING AEREO AND TELLING PEOPLE IT??S ILLEGAL TO HOOK UP A TV TUNER TO A COMPUTER SO PEOPLE CAN WATCH OVER-THE-AIR PROGRAMMING ONLINE. THOSE STREAMING RIGHTS COULD THEORETICALLY BE SOLD LATER FOR A LOT OF MONEY AND FROM A CREATOR??S PERSPECTIVE AEREO WAS TAKING THAT MONEY OUT OF THEIR POCKETS. FOR A CUSTOMER??LIKE ME??WHO SEES THIS RULING AS BASICALLY A REQUIREMENT THAT I BUY AN EXTRA SET OF EQUIPMENT A PAIR OF RABBIT EARS AND A TV TUNER TO WATCH JEOPARDY! ON MY COMPUTER AT 7:30 INSTEAD OF JUST DOING SO ONLINE IT??S INFURIATING. NETFLIX HOPES TO CUT THE GORDIAN KNOT BY CREATING ITS OWN CONTENT AND PUSHING IT OUT THROUGH ITS OWN SERVICE WITH NO MIDDLEMEN AT ALL MAKING SHOWS THAT ARE DISTRIBUTED ON A ??GLOBAL RIGHTS? BASIS FROM BEGINNING TO END. I WISH THEM GOOD LUCK ESPECIALLY BECAUSE JUST AS WITH GETTING PEOPLE TO PAY FOR CONTENT AS OPPOSED TO PIRATING IT GETTING PEOPLE TO WATCH NETFLIX ??LEGITIMATELY? RATHER THAN THROUGH A VPN IS MOSTLY A MATTER OF GOOD WILL. I HAVE MY DOUBTS THOUGH ESPECIALLY SINCE ONE OF THE FIRST REACTIONS TO NETFLIX GOING GLOBAL WAS AMERICANS SCRAMBLING TO GET A VPN SERVICE SO THEY CAN GET ILLICIT INTERNATIONAL GOODIES LIKE THAT EARLY-ACCESS STREAMING OF THE FORCE AWAKENS. AS WITH OTHER DIGITAL SERVICES MAYBE MOST OF THEM ONLINE STREAMING EXISTS IN A WEIRD LIMBO WHERE PLAYING BY THE RULES IS MOSTLY VOLUNTARY. NETFLIX IS STILL AFTER ALL BANNED COMPLETELY IN CHINA A COUNTRY WITH THE HARSHEST AND SCARIEST RESTRICTIONS ON ONLINE CONTENT AROUND AND YET TECH-SAVVY CHINESE CITIZENS WATCH NETFLIX??AND BROWSE FACEBOOK AND TWITTER??ALL THE TIME DESPITE THE GOVERNMENT??S BEST ATTEMPTS AT PLAYING WHACK-A-MOLE WITH VPN SERVICES. IT??S NOT THAT HARD EITHER IF YOU WANT TO TORRENT SHOWS THAT ARE TOO ANNOYING TO STREAM OR TO READ YOUR FAVORITE WEBSITES WITHOUT GIVING ANY MONEY TO THEIR ADVERTISERS. NOWADAYS CONTENT IS MOSTLY FUNDED BY LAZINESS PLUS A DOLLOP OF GUILT PEOPLE WHO FIND PAYING THE RELATIVELY CHEAP MONTHLY FEE FOR A STREAMING SERVICE EASY ENOUGH THAT THEY GIVE IN TO DOING THINGS THE LEGITIMATE WAY (DESPITE THE MINISCULE CHANCE OF GETTING IN ACTUAL LEGAL TROUBLE). CHINA BOTHERS TO KEEP THE GREAT FIREWALL UP BECAUSE OF THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO DON??T CARE ENOUGH TO CIRCUMVENT IT. NETFLIX IS HOPING THAT THEY??LL GET A MAJOR INFLUX OF REGULAR USERS WORLDWIDE WHO PREVIOUSLY LACKED THE INTEREST TO JUMP THROUGH THE HOOPS NECESSARY TO CIRCUMVENT GEOBLOCKING AND THAT THAT MASSIVE INFLUX WILL GIVE THEM ENOUGH FUNDING TO EVENTUALLY DEVELOP A FULLY INTERNET-BASED DISTRIBUTION MODEL THAT CUTS OUT THOSE PESKY REGIONAL DISTRIBUTORS ONCE AND FOR ALL. WHAT THEY PROBABLY FEAR IS THE REVERSE: THAT THIS WILL JUST GIVE TECH-SAVVY EXISTING NETFLIX USERS WORLDWIDE MORE INTERNATIONAL CONTENT TO SIFT THROUGH USING THE GEOBLOCKING CIRCUMVENTION TOOLS THEY??VE BEEN USING ALL ALONG PISSING OFF THE REGIONAL DISTRIBUTORS NETFLIX STILL HAS TO WORK WITH WITH LITTLE NET GAIN TO THEM IN THE END. AS SOMEONE WHO ALREADY DOES WATCH CONTENT INTENDED FOR OTHER REGIONS REGULARLY I??M GOING TO BE INCONVENIENCED BY NETFLIX??S CRACKDOWN ON VPNS MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE. BUT I??LL TAKE THAT INCONVENIENCE IF IT BRINGS US CLOSER TO THE DAY WE CAN LEAVE ALL THIS NONSENSE BEHIND US AND HAVE TRULY BORDER-FREE MEDIA. ,14365.0

AND IF THE TWO DEMOCRATIC FRONTRUNNERS LIKED EACH OTHER BEFORE THIS RACE THOSE FEELINGS WERE LONG GONE. IT BEGAN APPROPRIATELY ENOUGH WITH A GUN FIGHT. AS ?ŸTHE FIRST VOTES OF THE 2016 DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY ARE ONLY WEEKS AWAY CLINTON HAS POUNDED SANDERS RELENTLESSLY FOR HIS PAST POSITION ON GUNS??INSINUATING IN A RECENT AD THAT HE WAS SIDING WITH THE GUN LOBBY OVER PRESIDENT OBAMA??S PUSH FOR MORE GUN REGULATIONS. (SHE NEVER MENTIONS SANDERS?? NAME OF COURSE BUT IT??S ONE WINK SHORT OF ??RHYMES WITH MANDERS.?) ASKED ABOUT CLINTON??S ATTEMPTS TO TIE HIM TO THE GUN LOBBY SANDERS CAME OUT SWINGING. ??WELL I THINK SECRETARY CLINTON KNOWS THAT WHAT SHE SAYS IS VERY DISINGENUOUS? HE SAID. ?? I HAVE A D-MINUS VOTING RECORD FROM THE NRA.? CLINTON HIT BACK INVOKING THE MURDERS OF NINE AFRICAN AMERICANS LAST YEAR IN THEIR CHARLESTON CHURCH BY A WHITE MAN WITH FEDERAL CHARGES PENDING AGAINST HIM WHICH SHOULD HAVE PREVENTED HIM FROM GETTING A GUN. ??HE VOTED FOR WHAT WE CALL THE CHARLESTON LOOPHOLE? SHE BEGAN SOUNDING JUST A TAD REHEARSED. ??HE VOTED FOR IMMUNITY FROM GUNMAKERS AND SELLERS WHICH THE NRA SAID WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF GUN LEGISLATION IN 20 YEARS.? CLINTON ACCUSED SANDERS OF TURNING A BLIND EYE TO GUN REGULATIONS UNTIL THIS RACE. ??NOW I AM PLEASED TO HEAR THAT SENATOR SANDERS HAS REVERSED HIS POSITION ON IMMUNITY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HIM JOINING WITH THOSE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHO HAVE ALREADY INTRODUCED LEGISLATION? SHE SAID. AS SHE SPOKE SANDERS UNSUCCESSFULLY TRIED TO MASK HIS GRIMACES WITH SMILES AND SEEMED TO BE JUST WAITING FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO HIT BACK. AND HE DID WHEN ASKED WHY THE FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE WAS OUT-POLLING HIM WITH MINORITIES TWO TO ONE. ??WELL LET ME TALK ABOUT POLLING? SANDERS BEGAN CHANNELING HIS INNER DONALD TRUMP. ??AS SECRETARY CLINTON WELL KNOWS WHEN THIS CAMPAIGN BEGAN SHE WAS 50 POINTS AHEAD OF ME. WE WERE ALL OF THREE PERCENTAGE POINTS. GUESS WHAT? IN IOWA NEW HAMPSHIRE THE RACE IS VERY VERY CLOSE. MAYBE WE??RE AHEAD NEW HAMPSHIRE.? AND IT??S TRUE. IT??S A SCENARIO MADE OF NIGHT TERRORS FOR CLINTON WHO EIGHT YEARS AGO LOST IOWA TO ANOTHER INSURGENT PROGRESSIVE WHO HER CAMPAIGN DRASTICALLY UNDERESTIMATED. (IF YOU LISTEN CLOSELY YOU CAN ALMOST HEAR HER WHISPERING SOFTLY ??ONE TWO THREE WAKE UP.?) THAT??S NOT TO SAY SHE??LL LOSE THE NOMINATION IF IOWA (AND NEW HAMPSHIRE) GO FOR SANDERS??SOUTH CAROLINA (CLINTON IS AHEAD BY 40 POINTS IN THE REAL CLEAR POLITICS AVERAGE) NEVADA AND THE SEC PRIMARY STATES SHOULD PROVIDE STURDY FIREWALL PARTICULARLY AS THE ELECTORATE BECOMES MORE DIVERSE. BUT IT COULD SLOW HER ROLL INTO THE NOMINATIONAND AS MUCH AS HER CAMPAIGN SAYS THEY HAD ALWAYS EXPECTED A TOUGH RACE IT??S TOUGH TO BELIEVE ANYONE EVER CONSIDERED SANDERS WHO RESEMBLES ??DOC? FROM BACK TO THE FUTURE BUT IS MORE INTO SOCIAL EXPERIMENTS THAN ACTUAL EXPERIMENTS AS A REAL CHALLENGE. FORMER MARYLAND MARTIN O??MALLEY WAS ALSO PRESENT AT THE DEBATE AND SPENT MUCH OF IT BEGGING FOR AIR TIME WHEN HE WASN??T TAKING SWIPES AT CLINTON. SANDERS FOR HIS PART HAS PLAYED THE SAME GAME AS CLINTON IN RECENT DAYS??RELEASING AN AD LAST WEEK IN WHICH HE SAID ??THERE ARE TWO DEMOCRATIC VISIONS FOR REGULATING WALL STREET ONE SAYS IT??S O.K. TO TAKE MILLIONS FROM BIG BANKS AND THEN TELL THEM WHAT TO DO.? THE AD CLEARLY DIRECTED AT CLINTON BUT PLAYING IT CUTE LIKE HER GUN AD WAS IMMEDIATELY CONDEMNED ON A CONFERENCE CALL WITH CLINTON STAFFERS WHO WERE SHOCKED??NAY AGHAST??THAT SANDERS WOULD GO NEGATIVE. THEY POINTED TO SANDERS?? PLEDGE TO REMAIN POSITIVE??AND ACCUSED HIM OF BECOMING MORE OF A POLITICIAN BY THE DAY. AND SANDERS TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO KNOCK HER AGAIN WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE AD ON SUNDAY NIGHT. ??WELL THE FIRST DIFFERENCE IS I DON??T TAKE MONEY FROM BIG BANKS. I DON??T GET PERSONAL SPEAKING FEES FROM GOLDMAN SACHS? SANDERS SAID A REFERENCE TO ?ŸCLINTON??S PRICEY SPEAKING FEES DURING HER TIME OUT OF OFFICE. HE THEN WENT ON TO DESCRIBE HIS BELIEF THAT THE LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SHOULD BE BROKEN UP. CLINTON COUNTERED THAT SANDERS WAS SO FAR LEFT HE EVEN OPPOSED OBAMA WHO HELPED PUSH THROUGH WALL STREET REFORMS LIKE DODD-FRANK. SHE CAN TAKE THE ATTACKS CLINTON BEGAN BUT WHEN SANDERS STARTED TO ATTACK OBAMA??THAT WAS TOO FAR. ??SENATOR SANDERS CALLED HIM ??WEAK?? ??DISAPPOINTING??. HE EVEN IN 2011 PUBLICLY SOUGHT SOMEONE TO RUN IN A PRIMARY AGAINST PRESIDENT OBAMA? SHE SAID. ??NOW I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA??S WORK TO PUSH THROUGH THE DODD- FRANK??I??M GOING TO DEFEND DODD- FRANK AND I??M GOING TO DEFEND PRESIDENT OBAMA FOR TAKING ON WALL STREET TAKING ON THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY AND GETTING RESULTS.? IT WASN??T THE FIRST TIME DURING THE DEBATE THAT CLINTON HUGGED PRESIDENT OBAMA TIGHT AND SPOKE IN FAWNING TONES THAT ARE SURE TO BE A PART OF ANY GENERAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN AGAINST HER. MOST NOTABLY SHE DODGED A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER OBAMA SHOULD HAVE MADE GOOD ON HIS ??RED LINE? WITH SYRIA. IN THE PAST SHE HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT THEIR APPROACHES TO SYRIA WHERE DIFFERENT BUT NOT AT THIS DEBATE. STILL THROUGH THE BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN HIM AND CLINTON THERE WAS ONLY PLACE SANDERS REFUSED TO GO: PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON??S INFIDELITIES. WHEN ASKED BY NBC??S ANDREA MITCHELL WHETHER HE REGRETTED CALLING PRESIDENT CLINTON??S ??PAST TRANSGRESSIONS QUOTE ??TOTALLY TOTALLY TOTALLY DISGRACEFUL AND UNACCEPTABLE??? SANDERS DISMISSED IT IN THE SAME FASHION HE DISMISSED CLINTON??S ??DAMN EMAILS? MONTHS AGO. ??THAT QUESTION ANNOYS ME? HE SAID. ??WE??VE BEEN THROUGH THIS.

THE PRESIDENT HAS GONE SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT THE PARIS ATTACKERS WERE A ??BUNCH OF KILLERS WITH GOOD SOCIAL MEDIA.? DESPITE THE PRAISE HEAPED ON THE SO-CALLED ISLAMIC STATE FOR ITS CUTTING-EDGE PROPAGANDA ONLINE ONE OF ITS MOST EFFECTIVE PRODUCTS IS DECIDEDLY LOW TECH.?ŸDABIQ ISIS??S ONLINE NEWS MAGAZINE HAS A SMALL BUT DEVOTED READERSHIP THAT SPANS THE GLOBE. NEWS OF ADVANCES ON THE BATTLEFIELD EXCITE THEM??MORE EVIDENCE THAT GOD??S KINGDOM ON EARTH HAS RETURNED AND GROWS. STORIES OF FIGHTERS INSPIRE THEM??MORE MODELS TO EMULATE AS THEY CONTEMPLATE WHAT ROLE THEY CAN PLAY IN THE DIVINE DRAMA UNFOLDING. JOURNALISTS AND ANALYSTS READ IT WITH ALMOST THE SAME INTENSITY AS ISIS FANS THE CONTENTS OF EACH VOLUME FILL NEWSPAPERS AND THINK-TANK REPORTS SOON AFTER IT??S RELEASED. AND NO WONDER: THE MAGAZINE CLEARLY STATES THE ORGANIZATION??S GOALS PROVIDES NEWS OF ITS ACTIVITIES THAT ADVANCE THOSE GOALS SHOWCASES PERSONAL STORIES OF THE PEOPLE ENGAGED IN THE ACTIVITIES AND ANNOUNCES MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ORGANIZATION??S FIGHT AGAINST ITS ENEMIES. IT??S A WEALTH OF INFORMATION PRESENTED BETWEEN TWO COVERS EVERY FEW MONTHS. CAN YOU NAME A SINGLE U.S. GOVERNMENT PUBLICATION OR ONLINE PLATFORM DEVOTED TO THE ANTI-ISIS FIGHT THAT IS AS INFORMATIVE OR AS WIDELY-READ AS?ŸDABIQ? IS THERE ANYTHING THAT TELLS US WHAT ALL THESE AIR SORTIES ARE FOR? WHO??S FIGHTING THIS FIGHT ON THE GROUND? WHAT ADVANCES THE COALITION HAS MADE AND WHY WE SHOULD WE CARE? WE COULDN??T COME UP WITH ONE EITHER. THAT GOT US TO THINKING: WHY CAN??T THE U.S. GOVERNMENT PUBLISH SOMETHING LIKE?ŸDABIQ?ŸONLINE? LACK OF IMAGINATION ISN??T THE REASON. A NEWS MAGAZINE ISN??T A VERY CREATIVE IDEA??AMERICANS PERFECTED THE FORM WHICH ISIS COPIED. AND IF ANYTHING FOLKS INSIDE THE GOVERNMENT HAVE TOO MANY OVERLY-IMAGINATIVE IDEAS MOST OF THEM INVOLVING WHIZ-BANG TECHNOLOGY. IF YOU??VE THOUGHT IT THEY??VE THOUGHT IT. A SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN FOR YOUTH TO COME UP WITH WAYS TO COUNTER VIOLENT EXTREMISM? CHECK. SOCK-PUPPETRY? CHECK. THE ONLY REAL OBSTACLE IMPEDING THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS ITSELF. THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH??S COMPLICATED BUREAUCRACY LEGAL STRICTURES AND SENSITIVITY TO CRITICISM FROM MEDIA AND CONGRESS MAKE IT TOUGH TO PUBLISH A?ŸDABIQ-STYLE MAGAZINE. TO SEE WHAT WE MEAN LET??S LOOK AT TWO OF?ŸDABIQ??S REGULAR FEATURES AND SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT TRIED TO MIMIC THEM: ATTACK REPORTS:?ŸEACH ISSUE OF?ŸDABIQ?ŸDETAILS ITS ATTACKS ON ITS ENEMIES. ONE ENTRY IN ISSUE 12 CHRONICLED ISIS??S EFFORTS TO CAPTURE AN AIRBASE IN DAYR AL-ZAWR SYRIA. ANOTHER DESCRIBED FOUR SUICIDE ATTACKS ON THE SAUDI-LED COALITION FIGHTING SOUTHERN YEMEN. PICTURES ACCOMPANY MOST ENTRIES SOME QUITE GRUESOME. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ROUTINELY WRITES THESE TYPES OF REPORTS FOR INTERNAL CONSUMPTION. BUT WHEN THEY??RE PUBLIC??AND THUS UNDER THE SCRUTINY OF CONGRESS THAT HOLDS THE PURSESTRINGS AND THE MEDIA THAT HOLDS THE CAREERSTRINGS??ROUTINE GIVES WAY?ŸTO CAUTION AND QUARRELING. IF THE PRESIDENT ASKS HIS GOVERNMENT TO WRITE ATTACK REPORTS FOR THE PUBLIC THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE WILL QUARREL ABOUT WHO WILL TAKE THE LEAD IN WRITING AND PUBLISHING THEM. THEN THEY AND THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES WILL QUARREL OVER WHICH REPORTS SHOULD BE INCLUDED. WILL THIS REPORT COUNTER THE PRESIDENT??S INSISTENCE THAT WE HAVE NO BOOTS ON THE GROUND? WILL THAT REPORT MAKE IT LOOK LIKE OUR IRAQI PARTNERS AREN??T CARRYING THEIR WEIGHT? DOES THIS ONE TELL THE ENEMY TOO MUCH ABOUT OUR GAME PLAN? DOES THAT PICTURE MAKE U.S. SOLDIERS LOOK TOO MENACING? WILL THIS REPORT LATER BE DISCREDITED BY THE MEDIA? WILL THESE BATTLEFIELD SUCCESSES BE REVERSED IN THE FUTURE? DOES ANYONE KNOW IF ANOTHER AGENCY HAS SAID THIS OR ITS OPPOSITE? WILL ANYONE TRUST WHAT WE??RE SAYING? SHOULDN??T SOMEONE ELSE BE SAYING THIS? WHEN SOMETHING FINALLY SLIDES OFF THE SERPENTINE CONVEYOR BELT MONTHS LATER IT WILL BE A BLAND BLOB DEVOID OF DETAIL AND RELEVANCE. MEANWHILE ISIS WILL HAVE ADDED TWELVE MORE VOLUMES TO ITS SHELVES. BIOGRAPHIES OF FIGHTERS:?ŸDABIQ?ŸSOMETIMES PROFILES ITS FIGHTERS INCLUDING THE YOUNG MEN ON THE FRONT LINES DYING FOR ISIS??S CAUSE. THE FIGHTERS TELL THEIR STORIES AND EXPLAIN THEIR REASONS FOR FIGHTING. IN ISSUE 8 FOR EXAMPLE THERE IS A Q&A WITH THE MAN WHO MURDERED A PROMINENT POLITICIAN IN TUNISIA. HE EXPLAINS WHY HE DID IT AND HOW IT ADVANCES THE GREATER GOALS OF THE ISLAMIC STATE. THE UNITED STATES MILITARY USED TO FEATURE THESE SORTS OF STORIES TOO??BACK WHEN THE AMERICAN WAR IN IRAQ WAS A MASSIVE OVERT AFFAIR. NOW THAT??S NOT THE CASE. THE IDENTITIES OF THE AMERICANS FIGHTING IN SYRIA AND IRAQ ARE A WELL-GUARDED SECRET BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT WANT THEM OR THEIR FAMILIES TO BECOME TARGETS. THE GOVERNMENT WOULD ALSO FROWN ON THEM FOR NONCHALANTLY TALKING ABOUT KILLING LEST THE AMERICAN PUBLIC GET UPSET. AND THEN THERE??S THAT BOOTS ON THE GROUND THING. WITHOUT PERSONAL STORIES WE??RE LEFT WITH DRONES BUZZING IN THE SKY AND BUZZ-CUT OFFICERS DRONING THROUGH STALE PENTAGON BRIEFINGS. THE HUMAN COST ON BOTH SIDES IS REDUCED TO NUMBERS ON SLIDES WHICH MEANS AMERICANS CAN??T APPRECIATE THE TRUE COSTS OF WAR AND FOREIGNERS CAN??T APPRECIATE THE SACRIFICES AMERICANS ARE MAKING ON THEIR BEHALF. SOME READERS MIGHT FEEL THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE CONSTRAINED IN THESE WAYS. THEY WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO BE SENSITIVE TO PUBLIC OPINION AND EXCEEDINGLY CAUTIOUS WHEN TALKING ABOUT WAR AND VIOLENCE. IF SO THEY SHOULDN??T COMPLAIN WHEN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT EXPLAINS ITS ANTI-ISIS FIGHT IN THE VAGUEST POSSIBLE TERMS??THAT??S THE OUTCOME OF EXTREME CAUTION COMPOUNDED BY BUREAUCRATIC BARGAINING ON A MIND-BOGGLING SCALE. OTHERS MIGHT FEEL WE NEED TO REFORM THE WAY GOVERNMENT DOES MESSAGING. IF SO DON??T PROPOSE TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM FIRST. RATHER ASK THE SYSTEM TO PERFORM A SIMPLE TASK LIKE THE ONE WE??VE DESCRIBED AND SEE WHERE IT BREAKS DOWN. THEN YOU??LL KNOW WHAT TO FIX. MAKING A NEWS MAGAZINE PROBABLY ISN??T THE HIGH TECH SOLUTION THE GOVERNMENT IS LOOKING FOR AT LEAST JUDGING BY FRIDAY??S PILGRIMAGE OF SENIOR SECURITY OFFICIALS TO SILICON VALLEY AND THE REVAMPING OF STATE DEPARTMENT??S ONLINE COUNTER MESSAGING CAMPAIGN BUT IF OUR BYZANTINE POLL-SENSITIVE GOVERNMENT CAN??T DO SOMETHING SO BASIC IT WON??T PERFORM BETTER WHEN IT??S TASKED WITH SOMETHING MORE COMPLICATED NO MATTER HOW MUCH TECHNOLOGY IT USES. ,7699.0

ONE OF THE AMERICANS HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN CAUTIONED ABOUT LEAVING THE BASE WITHOUT GUARDS. ??HE HAD A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY? THE CONTRACTOR SAID. NOW U.S. OFFICIALS FEAR THEY ARE EITHER IN THE HANDS OF AN IRAQI MILITIA GROUP OR A CRIMINAL GANG THAT MAY TRADE THEM TO THE SO-CALLED ISLAMIC STATE U.S. OFFICIALS SAID. THE THREE MISSING AMERICANS WERE PROVIDING MAINTENANCE FOR THE U.S. TRAINING PROGRAM FOR IRAQI SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES THE CONTRACTOR SAID SPEAKING ANONYMOUSLY BECAUSE HE WAS NOT AUTHORIZED TO DESCRIBE THE INCIDENT PUBLICLY. ONE OF THE MEN IS AN ENGINEER FROM KANSAS AND ANOTHER IS A MIAMI-BASED ARABIC TRANSLATOR OF EGYPTIAN HERITAGE. HE AND HIS BROTHER TAKE TURNS WORKING TRANSLATION SHIFTS FOR THE CONTRACTOR IN BAGHDAD SAID THE AMERICAN WHO KNEW THE MEN. ??WE AWARE OF REPORTS THAT AMERICAN CITIZENS ARE MISSING IN IRAQ? U.S. EMBASSY SPOKESMAN SCOTT BOLZ SAID BY PHONE FROM BAGHDAD MONDAY. ??THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF AMERICANS OVERSEAS IS OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY. WE ARE WORKING WITH THE FULL COOPERATION OF THE IRAQI AUTHORITIES TO LOCATE AND RECOVER THE INDIVIDUALS.? HE DECLINED TO SHARE MORE DETAILS CITING THE U.S. PRIVACY ACT. A STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN IN WASHINGTON REQUESTED THAT THE DAILY BEAST WITHHOLD THE CONTRACTOR NAMES CITING THE ONGOING FBI INVESTIGATION INTO THEIR DISAPPEARANCE. THE FBI HAD NOT YET RESPONDED TO REQUESTS FOR COMMENT NOR HAS THE MAIN CONTRACTOR OR SUBCONTRACTOR COMPANY THAT EMPLOYS THEM. THE FAMILIES HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED AND THE FBI AND INVESTIGATORS FROM THE OFFICE OF SECURITY COOPERATION IRAQ ARE QUESTIONING COMPANY OFFICIALS AND WORKING TO FIND THE MISSING MEN THE CONTRACTOR SAID. A U.S. OFFICIAL IN BAGHDAD CONFIRMED THE FAMILIES HAD BEEN NOTIFIED SPEAKING ANONYMOUSLY BECAUSE HE WAS NOT AUTHORIZED TO DISCUSS THE MATTER PUBLICLY. THE MEN HAD LEFT THEIR BASE TRAVELING IN A SMALL PICKUP TRUCK TO MEET A FORMER INTERPRETER FROM THEIR TEAM AT HIS HOME IN THE SOUTHERN BAGHDAD NEIGHBORHOOD OF DURA. IT??S NOT CLEAR WHERE ALONG THE ROUTE THEY MAY HAVE DISAPPEARED THOUGH THE FORMER INTERPRETER WHO WENT BY THE NICKNAME ??RILEY? IS ALSO MISSING. THE IRAQI FORCES AND THE U.S. COMPANY THE MEN WORK FOR WERE FIRST TIPPED OFF TO THEIR ABSENCE WHEN THE IRAQI GENERAL WHO RUNS THE MILITARY BASE WHERE THE AMERICANS WORKED GOT A PHONE CALL FROM A CALLER CLAIMING TO BE ON GUARD AT AN IRAQI MILITARY. THE CALLER ASKED THE GENERAL IF THE THREE AMERICANS WORKED FOR HIM. HE SAID YES THINKING THE GATE GUARDS WOULD THEN LET THE MEN ENTER THE BASE. BUT THE MEN NEVER SHOWED UP. ??THE CALL SEEMED SUSPICIOUS AND FURTHER TRYING TO CONTACT OR TRACK THE NUMBER PROVED FRUITLESS? THE CONTRACTOR SAID. THE MEN ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN CARRYING THEIR CONTRACTOR IDENTIFICATION BADGES AND THEIR IRAQI WEAPONS LICENSES WHICH USUALLY INDICATE THEIR NATIONALITY. THE CONTRACTOR??S ACCOUNT THAT THE MEN WERE TAKEN WHEN THEY WERE ON THE WAY TO MEET A FORMER INTERPRETER WHO LIVED IN DORA MATCHES ONE TOLD TO THE ASSOCIATED PRESS BY AN UNNAMED IRAQI INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL. DORA WAS ONCE A STRONGHOLD FOR SUNNI INSURGENTS AND A BATTLEGROUND BETWEEN SUNNI MILITANTS AND SHI??ITE MILITIAS IN 2006-2007. THE WASHINGTON POST REPORTED MONDAY THAT THE MEN WERE ABDUCTED FROM A BROTHEL. RESTAURANTS THAT SERVE ALCOHOL AND ESTABLISHMENTS THAT PROVIDE SUCH SERVICES ARE OFTEN TARGETED BY SHI??ITE MILITIA GROUPS CRACKING DOWN ON WHAT THEY SEE AS ILLICIT BEHAVIOR. IRAQ ALSO USED TO HAVE A COTTAGE INDUSTRY OF KIDNAPPING RINGS WHO WOULD RANSOM THE CAPTIVES BACK TO THEIR FOREIGN COMPANIES OR SELL THEM TO MILITANT GROUPS LIKE AL QAEDA IN IRAQ THE PRECURSOR TO THE SO-CALLED ISLAMIC STATE.

A CORRESPONDENT IN NIGERIA A NATION OF MORE THAN 70 MILLION MUSLIMS SAYS: ??TRUMP WAS TRENDING ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND BELIEVE ME HE WAS THE ONE MAN ON EARTH NIGERIANS HATED THE MOST. HE STILL IS.? LEADERS FROM FRANCE EGYPT CANADA THE UNITED NATIONS AND SAUDI ARABIA WERE AMONG THOSE TO PUBLICLY CRITICIZE TRUMP FOR HIS PROPOSED BAN ON ENTRY TO AMERICA ON RELIGIOUS GROUNDS. IN LONDON POLITICIANS HELD AN UNPRECEDENTED DEBATE IN PARLIAMENT ABOUT WHETHER TO INTRODUCE A TIT-FOR-TAT BAN THAT WOULD PREVENT TRUMP FROM TRAVELING TO BRITAIN. THE DEBATE WAS TABLED BY LABOUR??S PAUL FLYNN AFTER MORE THAN HALF A MILLION MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SIGNED A PETITION BACKING A BAN. ??HE DOES SEEM TO BE RECKLESS ARROGANT IMPULSIVE??AND THOSE ARE HIS BEST QUALITIES? FLYNN TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. ??HE DOESN??T FIT THE MOLD OF ANYONE??S IDEA OF A STATESMAN BECAUSE OF HIS RASH STATEMENTS HIS FLYING OFF THE HANDLE TO ABUSE FRIEND AND FOE. THERE ARE FEW POLITICIANS THAT HAVE BEEN SO OBVIOUSLY RECKLESS IN MODERN TIMES THERE WERE PEOPLE LIKE THAT BEFORE THE LAST WAR OF COURSE.? GAWPING AT TRUMP HAS BECOME A NATIONAL PASTIME IN BRITAIN A NATION THAT USUALLY PAYS LITTLE ATTENTION TO INTERNATIONAL POLITICS. THE WINDOW IN ONE BARBERSHOP IN ST. PAUL??S IN CENTRAL LONDON READS: ??IF TRUMP BECOMES PRESIDENT THERE WILL BE HELL TOUPEE.? FLYNN SAID THE PUBLIC HAD TURNED AGAINST TRUMP NOT JUST OVER HIS HARSH WORDS TOWARD MUSLIMS BUT FOR A NUMBER OF OFFENSIVE STATEMENTS. ??HIS REMARKS ABOUT WOMEN AND AGAINST THE DISABLED JOURNALIST CAME PRETTY HIGH UP ON THE LEVELS OF REVULSION AGAINST POLITICIANS. THERE ARE VERY FEW COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD WHERE MOCKERY OF WOMEN AND THE DISABLED IS ACCEPTABLE.? IN MUSLIM TURKEY PRESIDENT RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN OFFERED A STINGING CRITIQUE OF TRUMP??S POLITICAL ACUMEN. ??A SUCCESSFUL POLITICIAN WOULD NOT MAKE SUCH STATEMENT? HE SAID. ERDOGAN WHO HAS BEEN EITHER PRIME MINISTER OR PRESIDENT OF TURKEY SINCE 2003 SAID TRUMP WOULD FACE AN EMBARRASSING SITUATION IF HE EVER GOT TO THE WHITE HOUSE. ??I DON??T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT HE??LL WIN BUT LET??S SUPPOSE HE WON. WHAT WILL HAPPEN? WILL HE SET ASIDE ALL RELATIONSHIPS WITH MUSLIM COUNTRIES? A POLITICIAN SHOULDN??T TALK LIKE THIS.? HE HASN??T ONLY GOT FLAK FROM THE GOVERNMENT BUT ALSO HIS BUSINESS PARTNERS SUGGESTING HIS FIERY POLITICAL RHETORIC COULD HAVE FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS. BULENT KURAL MANAGER OF A SHOPPING MALL AT THE ISTANBUL TRUMP TOWERS A TWIN HIGH-RISE COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL BUILDING CONDEMNED WHAT HE SAID. ??SUCH STATEMENTS BEAR NO VALUE AND ARE PRODUCTS OF A MIND THAT DOES NOT UNDERSTAND ISLAM A PEACE RELIGION AT ALL? KURAL SAID. THE TRUMP TOWER COMPLEX IN ISTANBUL WAS DEVELOPED BY TURKISH BILLIONAIRE AYDIN DOGAN WHO PAYS TRUMP FOR THE NAME. HIS GLOBAL BRAND COULD CLEARLY SUFFER. IN CHINA HIS BUSINESS REPUTATION IS ALREADY COMPROMISED DESPITE REPEATED BRAGGING THAT HE ??KNOWS CHINA.? OVER THERE HE IS COMPARED TO THE NUTTY CHINESE BILLIONAIRE CHEN GUANGBIAO WHO ONCE TRIED TO BUY THE NEW YORK TIMES. IT IS WELL-KNOWN THAT IN THE ??80S AND ??90S HE WENT TO HONG KONG TO LOOK FOR INVESTORS WHO COULD HELP BAIL HIM OUT OF A TIGHT SPOT. SOME LOCAL TYCOONS INVITED HIM TO PLAY GOLF FOR $1 MILLION A HOLE TRUMP REALIZED HE WAS BEING OUTMUSCLED AND DECLINED. THE INVESTORS DID EVENTUALLY BUY UP PART OF TRUMP??S MORTGAGE FOR $82 MILLION. WHEN THEY CASHED OUT FOR $1.8 BILLION A DECADE LATER TRUMP WAS SO FURIOUS THAT HE SUED THEM. THE AVERAGE CHINESE MAN ON THE STREET MAY NOT BE FOLLOWING THE AMERICAN ELECTION BUT THE GLOBAL TIMES AN UBER-NATIONALISTIC STATE-RUN MEDIA OUTLET WARNED READERS THURSDAY: ??IF YOU PLAN TO VISIT NEW YORK SOMETIME THIS YEAR TAKE MY ADVICE: TRY TO STAY AWAY FROM FIFTH AVENUE BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP MAY BE LURKING THERE WITH A GUN.? INDEED GORDON CHANG AUTHOR OF THE COMING COLLAPSE OF CHINA AND DAILY BEAST CONTRIBUTOR SAID BEIJING WAS PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION. ??CHINA IS OBSESSED WITH TRUMP JUST AS TRUMP IS OBSESSED WITH CHINA? HE SAID. ??STATE MEDIA TAKES HIS CANDIDACY AS PROOF THAT AMERICAN DEMOCRACY IS FLAWED COMPARING HIM TO A ??CELEBRITY POTATO?? FOR INSTANCE. CHINESE NETIZENS GENERALLY DENIGRATE HIM AS WELL BUT IN A COUNTRY WHERE COMMUNIST PARTY LEADERS ARE HIGHLY SCRIPTED YOU CAN BE SURE THEY SECRETLY ADMIRE SOMEONE WHO SPEAKS HIS MIND.? ON THE OTHER SIDE OF CHINA??S MOUNTAINOUS BORDER WITH AFGHANISTAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IN KABUL WERE EQUALLY UNIMPRESSED. ZARDASHT SHAMS THE DEPUTY MINISTER OF INFORMATION SAID THEY WERE STILL WAITING TO HEAR A REAL POLICY ON HOW TRUMP WOULD DEAL WITH THE U.S. DRAWDOWN AND POST-CONFLICT RESOLUTION. ??SORRY I??M NOT WELL UPDATED ON THIS FOOL??S POLICY OR STAND ON AFGHANISTAN? HE TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. ??IN GENERAL AFGHANISTAN BEING A CONSERVATIVE AND RADICAL MUSLIM SOCIETY WOULD HATE AND EXTREMELY DISLIKE [TRUMP BECOMING PRESIDENT] AND FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE OF HIS ANTI-MUSLIM STATEMENTS.? THE HOSTILITY TOWARD MUSLIMS HAS GONE DOWN BETTER WITH SOME IN ISRAEL WHERE THE STATEMENTS HAVE RESONATED WITH A GROWING FAR-RIGHT MOVEMENT WHICH HAS CALLED UPON ISRAELI POLITICIANS TO REVOKE ISRAELI ARABS?? CITIZENSHIP AND RESIDENCY RIGHTS AS A FORM OF COLLECTIVE PUNISHMENT. THESE EXTREMISTS SEE MUSLIMS AND ARABS AS A BARBARIC ENEMY THAT UNDERSTAND ONLY POWER AND WITH WHOM THE ENLIGHTENED ??WESTERN? WORLD CANNOT NEGOTIATE AND SOME SEE PARALLELS HERE IN TRUMP??S OWN WORLDVIEW. WITHIN THAT FAR-RIGHT MOVEMENT A LOT OF ISRAELIS SEE TRUMP??S BRASH RACISM AS A REFRESHING DOSE OF TRUTH. WHILE TRUMP SCARES MANY IN THE ISRAELI LEFT HE HAS WON CREDIT AMONG EVEN THE MAINSTREAM RIGHT FOR SAYING THAT THE WORLD SHOULD RECOGNIZE JERUSALEM AS THE COUNTRY??S CAPITAL AND ISRAEL??S NEED FOR A SEPARATION WALL BOTH OF WHICH PRESIDENT OBAMA AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAVE CRITICIZED. ANOTHER POTENTIAL FRIEND IS LOUNGING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA. SILVIO BERLUSCONI NOW 79 HAS HAD A LOW PROFILE IN ITALY SINCE BEING BANNED FROM PUBLIC OFFICE IN 2013 FOR TAX FRAUD. HE RECENTLY SAID HIS PARTY STILL NEEDS HIM SO HE IS CLAIMING THAT HIS OUSTING WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND FRIENDLY WORDS FROM TRUMP HAVE BEEN WARMLY WELCOMED. ??I LOVE ITALY? TRUMP SAID. ??BERLUSCONI? HE??S A GREAT GUY. I LIKE HIM.? BERLUSCONI SEEMS TO THINK THIS WILL HELP HIM BACK INTO POWER. HE HAS ALWAYS MAINTAINED CLOSE PERSONAL TIES WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN AND ONE MIGHT ENVISION THE THREE OF THEM IN A SORT OF CLUB OF GLOBAL MISFITS IF TRUMP IS ELECTED AND BERLUSCONI IS BACK IN POWER. IN THE REST OF WESTERN EUROPE MAINSTREAM POLITICIANS AND THE MEDIA HAVE BEEN LARGELY CRITICAL OF THE AMERICAN PROPERTY TYCOON. IN GERMANY DER SPIEGEL PUBLISHED AN ARTICLE EXPLAINING ??TRUMP??S WORLD.? THEY CONCLUDED: ??YOU CAN LAUGH ABOUT IT GET ANGRY ABOUT IT??THIS MAN LIVES ON HIS OWN PLANET.? THE DUTCH MAGAZINE ELSEVIER TRIED HARDER TO EXPLAIN TRUMPS?? POPULARITY IN THE POLLS. ??TRUMP CHOOSES FORT AMERICA?? HE??S OBSESSED WITH NATIONAL IDENTITY. IT IS A MISTAKE TO DISMISS HIM AS A CLOWN WITHOUT IDEOLOGY. HE CERTAINLY HAS A NATIONALIST IDEOLOGY WHICH IS IN TUNE WITH THE INTERNATIONAL ZEITGEIST.? DEEYAH KHAN A FILMMAKER BORN IN NORWAY SAID THERE HAD BEEN A REAL EFFECT ON EUROPE??S MUSLIM POPULATION ESPECIALLY AFTER MUSLIM AND SIKH CITIZENS WERE THROWN OUT OF TRUMP EVENTS. ??THE TRUMP PHENOMENON SHOWS US HOW MUCH FEAR OF MUSLIMS THERE IS OUT THERE AND HOW EASILY IT CAN BE EXPLOITED? SHE TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. ??THE REACTION OF HIS FOLLOWERS TO ROSE HAMID AND ARISH SING IS DEEPLY SCARY.? WHEN HE ANNOUNCED HIS PRESIDENTIAL RUN LAST SUMMER LE MONDE DESCRIBED HIM IN ITS HEADLINE FLATLY BUT CORRECTLY AS AN ??ECCENTRIC BILLIONAIRE.? SINCE THEN PEOPLE IN FRANCE AND BELGIUM HAVE LEARNED THAT HE CASTS HIS INSULTS FAR AND WIDE. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WEEK IN AN INTERVIEW WITH MARIA BARTIROMO ON FOX BUSINESS SHE ASKED TRUMP ABOUT HIS PLANS TO STOP MUSLIMS FROM ENTERING THE UNITED STATES. HE CITED PARIS AND BRUSSELS AS PLACES WHERE MUSLIMS WERE OUT OF CONTROL AND UNASSIMILATED: ??YOU GO TO BRUSSELS ??I WAS IN BRUSSELS A LONG TIME AGO 20 YEARS AGO SO BEAUTIFUL EVERYTHING IS SO BEAUTIFUL??IT??S LIKE LIVING IN A HELLHOLE RIGHT NOW.? WHEN THE BELGIAN PRESS TRANSLATED HELLHOLE IDIOMATICALLY IT CAME OUT AS ??TROU ?Ÿ RATS? OR LITERALLY RAT HOLE.

IN HIS INSTAGRAM POST THE GAME ALSO CALLED OUT CELEBS LIKE MADONNA AND FALLON FOR DONATING ONLY $10000 WHICH HE FELT WAS INSUFFICIENT GIVEN THEIR IMMENSE WEALTH. ??I CALLED ??EM OUT AND THEN I DIDN??T CALL ??EM OUT? HE SAYS. ??THE ONLY REASON I MENTIONED MADONNA AND FALLON IS I FOLLOW MADONNA ON TWITTER AND SAW IT ON MY FEED AND I SAW ??TEN-THOUSAND DOLLARS.?? MADONNA? COME ON MAN. SHE??S PAID IT FORWARD HER WHOLE LIFE THOUGH ADOPTING KIDS AND DONATING MONEY. BUT SPECIFICALLY TO THE WATER CRISIS IN FLINT WE CAN DO BETTER THAN $10000. IT TAKES ABOUT NINE BOTTLES PER PERSON PER DAY TO BATHE AND DRINK SO $10000 CONTRIBUTES BUT THEY COULD??VE DONE A LOT MORE.? HE ADDS ??WHAT MEEK DID WAS VERY GENEROUS AND THAT??S GREAT. BUT WHAT I WANT CELEBRITIES TO DO IS TO STOP SAYING ??I PLEDGE WATER.?? THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO GET UP EVERY MORNING AND SAY THEY PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO THE FLAG BUT DON??T REALLY HONOR IT. TALK IS CHEAP. SO I POSTED A PICTURE OF MY WIRE TRANSFER AND I??LL POST PICTURES OF THE WATER GOING INTO FLINT EVERY DAY UNTIL IT??S DONE??NOT TO BRAG BUT TO SPEAK TO THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY WANT TO FIX THE PROBLEM.? UNLIKE SOME OF THESE OTHER CELEBRITIES THE GAME HAS A PERSONAL CONNECTION TO THE EMBATTLED CITY OF FLINT.?Ÿ ??MY SISTER LIVES IN FLINT WITH MY NIECES AND NEPHEWS AND HER HUSBAND AND SO IT DIRECTLY AFFECTED ME? HE SAYS. ??I??VE GOT FRIENDS WHO ARE STILL STUCK THERE TOO.

THE BOOK LAID THE FOUNDATION FOR HIS NAZI IDEOLOGY AND THE ROADMAP TO THE THIRD REICH. MEIN KAMPF (MY STRUGGLE) WAS HITLER??S PREAMBLE TO WAR IT??S WHERE HE PREACHED WHAT HE WOULD LATER PRACTICE. BUT FEW ALIVE TODAY HAVE ACTUALLY READ IT ESPECIALLY IN ITS ORIGINAL LANGUAGE. BECAUSE IN GERMANY HITLER??S BOOK WAS BANNED FROM THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR UNTIL JANUARY 1 THIS YEAR. NOW GERMANY??S INSTITUTE OF CONTEMPORARY HISTORY IS REPUBLISHING IT AND WHILE THIS SCHOLARLY VERSION IS THE FIRST EDITION TO GO BACK ON SALE IN MODERN GERMANY IT MAY NOT BE THE LAST. BUT WILL IT SELL? MARKET FORCES MAY HAVE A PART TO PLAY IN THIS AND RIGHT NOW THE MARKET IS TO SAY THE LEAST UNCERTAIN. ??NOBODY READ MEIN KAMPF WHEN HITLER WAS IN POWER.? SAYS NIKLAS FRANK AND HE SHOULD KNOW. HIS FATHER WAS HANS FRANK CONFIDANTE OF HITLER AND THE HIGH PROFILE NAZI GOVERNOR OF POLAND RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF MILLIONS. AS THE CHILD OF A MAJOR WAR CRIMINAL NIKLAS FRANK HAS FEW GOOD WORDS FOR HITLER??S NAZI MANIFESTO. ??WHEN YOU WERE MARRIED YOU GOT A COPY OF THIS BLOODY BOOK BUT NOBODY REALLY WAS INTERESTED IN IT.? THE NEW GERMAN EDITION OF MEIN KAMPF IS HITTING THE STORES JUST NOW 90 YEARS AFTER THE FIRST PRINTING IN 1926. THE MUNICH-BASED INSTITUTE OF CONTEMPORARY HISTORY HAS PULLED TOGETHER AN ANNOTATED VERSION OF HITLER??S MEGALOMANIC DIATRIBE ADDING NO LESS THAN 1200 PAGES TO THE ALREADY VERY BULKY 800-PAGE READ. IF THE ORIGINAL WAS BORING THIS ONE MAY BE VERY HEAVY GOING INDEED. THAT THIS NEW EDITION LIKE THE FIRST ONE IS PRINTED IN MUNICH IS NO COINCIDENCE. THE GERMAN STATE OF BAVARIA OF WHICH MUNICH IS THE CAPITAL HAS HELD THE COPYRIGHT TO HITLER??S BOOK EVER SINCE THE WAR ENDED. MUNICH YOU??LL RECALL IS THE PLACE WHERE NAZISM WAS BORN AND FLOURISHED. IN THIS CITY YOUNG AUSTRIAN-BORN ADOLPH SCHICKLGRUBER SETTLED IN 1913 WHEN HE WAS 24 AND RECAST HIMSELF WITH THE PUNCHIER SURNAME OF HITLER. AFTER THEIR FOILED 1923 COUP THE SO-CALLED BIERSTUBE (BEER HALL) PUTSCH THE NAZIS PROCLAIMED MUNICH THE ??CAPITAL OF THE MOVEMENT.? BECAUSE HITLER ONLY LEFT MUNICH TO TAKE HIS PARLIAMENTARY SEAT IN BERLIN AS CHANCELLOR IN 1933 HIS OFFICIAL RESIDENCY REMAINED HERE. THAT IS HOW BAVARIA MANAGED TO GET THE RIGHTS TO THE BOOK AND PREVENT ANY GERMAN COPIES FROM BEING PUBLISHED UNTIL JANUARY THE 1ST OF 2016. COPYRIGHT IN GERMANY EXPIRES AFTER 70 YEARS. NIKLAS FRANK TOLD THE DAILY BEAST HE FIRST READ MEIN KAMPF WHEN HE PICKED UP A GERMAN-LANGUAGE COPY AS A JOURNALIST IN NAMIBIA MANY YEARS AGO. ??THERE YOU CAN BUY IT IN EVERY BOOKSHOP? HE SAID. AS FOR THIS REPRINT HE SEES NO DANGER IN IT. ??BRILLIANT IDEA IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE YEARS AGO. A BIG PART OF MEIN KAMPF IS BORING SOMETIMES IT??S EVEN A LITTLE FUNNY? FRANK SNIGGERS. ??WHEN HE [HITLER] DESCRIBES HOW HE STARTED THE NATIONAL SOCIALIST PARTY FOR INSTANCE. AS THE NAME OF THE BOOK SUGGESTS ??MY STRUGGLE?? HE IS ALWAYS PRETENDING TO DO OR FULFILL SOMETHING OR OTHER.? MUNICH IS WEALTHY AND BEAUTIFUL AND MANY OF ITS PEOPLE TODAY FIT THAT DESCRIPTION. MEN ARE ATTIRED IN SMART CASUAL WEAR AND WOMEN DRESS IN COATS WITH FUR TRIMMINGS. THEY SLOWLY PARADE THE QUAINT LITTLE SQUARES AND SHINY BOULEVARDS THAT MAKE UP THE CENTER OF TOWN. IT LOOKS LIKE A CLASSIC CHILDREN??S PICTURE BOOK NOTHING IS OUT OF PLACE. IN THE SHOP WINDOWS DIRNDL DRESSES AND LEDERHOSEN ARE SOLD NEXT DOOR TO SPECIALIZED STORES SELLING ONLY TEA OR HERBS. THE BAVARIAN CAPITAL HAS ALWAYS BEEN AFFLUENT EVEN BETWEEN THE TWO WORLD WARS. IT??S ALWAYS CROWDED AT THE LOCAL BIERSTUBE HOFBRAUHAUS A PLACE WHERE TOURISTS CAN MINGLE WITH LOCALS AND TASTE THE REGIONAL BEERS. THE BRASS BAND PLAYS TRADITIONAL FOLKLORIC MUSIC IN ITS DOMED BASEMENT AS PEOPLE SIT DOWN AT ITS LONG TABLES. BEFORE THE WAR THE MUNICH BIERSTUBE WAS THE PLACE WHERE NAZIS HELD THEIR MEETINGS. HITLER HIMSELF PASSED BY. BUT ON THE EVE OF THE MEIN KAMPF REPUBLICATION BUCK PRESTON KEVIN AND LENA ARE AT A TABLE HERE NEAR THE BRASS BAND. THE TRUMPET PLAYER IS A MEMBER OF THEIR OWN BAND IN FACT. THE GROUP MEETS HERE TWICE A YEAR. BUCK: ??MY GRANDFATHER WAS FIGHTING AS A GI AND KEVIN??S GRANDFATHER WAS IN THE SS THEY WERE MORTAL ENEMIES AND HERE WE ARE!? THE PERSONAL STORIES OF THIS GATHERING GIVE THE IMPRESSION EVERYONE??S FAMILY HERE IS LINKED SOMEHOW TO THE WAR. MOST OF THEM GREW UP IN MUNICH OR AROUND IT. BUCK IS FROM DACHAU. ??SO EVERY TIME SOMEONE LOOKS AT MY PASSPORT THEY REACT. BUT BECAUSE I??VE GOT DARK SKIN NOBODY BOTHERS ME ABOUT IT.? BUCK AND PRESTON??S FAMILY HISTORIES ARE ENTWINED WITH THE WAR BECAUSE THEIR GRANDFATHERS WERE AMERICAN GI??S. PRESTON??S GRANDFATHER MARRIED A GERMAN GIRL AND ONLY SEPARATED YEARS AFTER. PRESTON: ??MY GRANDFATHER MARRIED A GERMAN GIRL I WAS BORN IN THE US BUT RAISED AS A TRUE GERMAN SO I GET A PERSPECTIVE FROM BOTH SIDES THAT??S GREAT.? BUCK STILL WANTS TO LOOK FOR HIS AMERICAN RELATIVES AT SOME POINT. HIS FATHER NEVER MET HIS GRANDFATHER THE GI FRANK WOOTZ WHO IMPREGNATED HIS GRANDMOTHER THEN WENT BACK TO THE FAMILY HE HAD ALREADY IN THE STATES. AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE LAUNCHING THE BOOK MEIN KAMPF??S NEW EDITION WAS INTRODUCED BY DR. ANDREAS WIRSCHING DIRECTOR OF THE INSTITUTE OF CONTEMPORARY HISTORY. ??IT WOULD BE IRRESPONSIBLE TO LET THIS CONVOLUTED VERSION OF INHUMANITY ROAM FREE WITHOUT CRITICAL REFERENCE? HE SAID EXPLAINING THE PURPOSE OF THE VOLUMINOUS ANNOTATIONS. BY ??CONTEXTUALIZING AND DECONSTRUCTING? THE ORIGINAL WORK THE INSTITUTE HOPES TO INOCULATE ITS READERS AGAINST NAZISM. ??WE PUBLISHED THE BOOK OURSELVES WITHOUT COMMERCIAL INTENTIONS? SAID WIRSCHING. ??THE PURPOSE IS TO ADD TO THE DEMYSTIFICATION TO PRESENT THE DEADLY RACISM IN A CRITICAL WAY.? BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE INSTITUTE INSISTS THE BOOK WAS NOT MADE FOR THE CLASSROOM. ??NAZIONAL SOCIALISMUS IS NOT TO BE REDUCED TO HITLER ALONE? SAID WIRSCHING. ??I WOULDN??T PROPAGATE A SCHOOL VERSION OF OUR EDITION??. THE PROBLEM WITH MEIN KAMPF IS THAT IT IS NOT JUST A BOOK IT??S A SYMBOL.? I ANY CASE THERE IS NOT MUCH CHANCE OF THIS PRINTED BEAST ROAMING FREE. THE EXPIRATION OF COPYRIGHT MEANS MEIN KAMPF CAN BE REPRINTED YES BUT ONLY WITH COMMENTARY. VERSIONS WITHOUT IT REMAIN BANNED BECAUSE OF GERMANY??S HATE SPEECH LAWS. AT THE INSTITUTE A TEAM OF HISTORIANS FROM THE CENTER AND OUTSIDE WORKED ON THE NEW FORMAT FOR THREE YEARS. ??WE HAVE A SCIENTIFIC APPROACH? SAID WIRSCHING. ??OUR LIBRARY HOLDS 200.000 BOOKS. OUR ARCHIVE IS FIVE KILOMETERS LONG.? THE SELLING OF MEIN KAMPF IS NOT A STRICTLY GERMAN BUT AN INTERNATIONAL PROBLEM SAID WIRSCHING. HE SHOWED A PHOTO FROM NEW DELHI WHERE US PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA??S BOOK COVER IS FEATURED NEXT TO HITLER??S. THEY LOOK SHOCKINGLY SIMILAR. ??WE HAVE TO AVOID THE BOOK BECOMING AN ARTICLE FOR EXPORT. WE WILL COME UP WITH A STRATEGY TO PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING.? BUT THAT STRATEGY MAY BECOME A MATTER OF URGENCY NOW THAT THE INITIAL EDITION WAS ALREADY UPPED FROM 4000 TO 15000 COPIES BECAUSE OF THE DEMAND. NIKLAS FRANK IS NOT WORRIED: ??EVERYBODY SHOULD READ THIS CRAP? HE SAYS. ??WE ALL KNOW WHAT CAME OF IT: COMPLETELY INDUSTRIALIZED MASS MURDER. YOU DON??T BELIEVE WHAT YOU READ BECAUSE YOU KNOW HITLER WAS A MASS MURDERER AND PEOPLE LIKE MY FATHER HELPED HIM DO IT.? THAT MAY BE SO BUT AT THE BEER HALL THERE IS STILL SOMETHING THAT BOTHERS BUCK ABOUT THE REPRINT: ??IT??S IS THE IDEA THAT THE BOOK IS SOLD AGAIN AND PEOPLE ARE MAKING MONEY BECAUSE OF IT THAT I DON??T LIKE. ANYWAY WHAT??S BEING TAUGHT IN SCHOOL IS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT YOU LEARN AT HOME. MY MOTHER??S FATHER TOLD ME HE CRIED WHEN HITLER DIED IT WAS ALL HE KNEW.? SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE THE TOXIC PROCLAMATION IS STILL TOO DANGEROUS TO READ. AFTER ALL IT WAS ONCE USED TO PROPAGATE NAZISM IN PREPARATION FOR THE BRAVE NEW WORLD CALLED THE THIRD REICH. WHAT IF AN EDUCATIONAL SCHEME FAILS TO DEMYSTIFY NAZISM AND IN FACT INADVERTENTLY FINDS A NEW AUDIENCE FOR ITS RACIST IDEALS? NIKLAS FRANK SAYS HE DOESN??T BELIEVE THAT??S POSSIBLE: ??MEIN KAMPF IS ONLY OF INTEREST TO PEOPLE WHO WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HISTORY OR PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO WERE BORN INTO A FAMILY OF A BIG SHOT NAZI CRIMINAL. BUT IT??S NOT AN ISSUE FOR A GREAT DEBATE OR FOR PEOPLE IN THE STREET TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT.? IN AN OFFICIAL STATEMENT DR. JOSEF SCHUSTER PRESIDENT OF THE CENTRAL COUNCIL OF JEWS IN GERMANY HESITANTLY EMBRACED THE SCIENTIFIC EDITION. HE STARTED BY SAYING THE COUNCIL ??IS CONVINCED? THAT THE BOOK ??MUST REMAIN PROHIBITED.? BUT HE WENT ON ??UNFORTUNATELY IT CAN ALREADY BE PURCHASED VIA THE INTERNET AND ABROAD? AND ??KNOWLEDGE OF MEIN KAMPF CONTINUES TO BE IMPORTANT IN ORDER TO EXPLAIN NATIONAL SOCIALISM AND THE SHOAH. THEREFORE WE DO NOT OBJECT TO A CRITICAL EDITION CONTRASTING HITLER??S RACIAL THEORIES WITH SCIENTIFIC FINDINGS TO BE AT THE DISPOSAL OF RESEARCH AND TEACHING.? WHEN BOOKS ARE BANNED AND GATHERINGS ARE OUTLAWED IDEOLOGY DOES NOT LOSE ITS APPEAL. THE FORBIDDEN OFFERS ITS OWN ATTRACTIONS ESPECIALLY TO THE YOUNG. AT THE HOFBRAUHAUS TABLE OF FRIENDS KEVIN SAID HIS GRANDFATHER WHO SERVED IN THE SS ALWAYS HAD ??STRANGE IDEAS? ABOUT THE WAR. ??WHEN HITLER CAME TO POWER HE WAS ONLY 13 AND HE WAS 25 WHEN IT ENDED. MY GRANDFATHER OWNED A COPY OF MEIN KAMPF WITH GOLD INLAY AND A PERSONAL SIGNATURE OF HITLER. THAT BOOK IS NOW WORTH A FORTUNE ON THE BLACK MARKET BECAUSE NEO-NAZIS LOVE THAT RUBBISH. FOR THEM IT??S LIKE A BIBLE SIGNED BY JESUS.? ANGELA MERKEL??S RULING CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC UNION GOVERNMENT ARGUES THAT GIVING NAZISM A CONTEXT AND BRINGING IT INTO THE CLASSROOM WOULD BE A PRODUCTIVE EFFORT TO NIP THE LURE OF NEO- NAZISM IN THE BUD. ALEXANDRA SENFFT AN AUTHOR AND MIDDLE EAST EXPERT BECAME ACUTELY AWARE OF HER OWN FAMILY HISTORY ONLY LATER IN LIFE. ??MY FAMILY DIDN??T TALK ABOUT THE WAR. I KNEW MY GRANDFATHER WAS THE THIRD REICH ENVOY IN SLOVAKIA SO HE WAS IN AN UPPER LEVEL OF NAZI LEADERSHIP. I LATER FOUND OUT HE WAS CO-RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEPORTATION OF 65.000 SLOVAKIAN JEWS MOST OF WHOM DIED IN THE CAMPS. IN HER BOOK SILENCE HURTS SHE SAYS ??I INVESTIGATE THE TRANS-GENERATIONAL CONSEQUENCES OF GUILT AND THE HOLOCAUST AND WAR THOUGH MY GRANDMOTHER MOTHER AND ME.? WHERE DOES HITLER??S TOME FIT INTO THAT PICTURE. ??BY ALL MEANS LOOK AT MEIN KAMPF AND CONTEXTUALIZE IT? SAYS SENFFT. ??IT IS PART OF OUR HISTORY. WHAT I AM KIND OF HESITANT ABOUT IS IDENTIFYING HITLER AS NAZISM AS SUCH. I FIND IT MUCH MORE IMPORTANT TO NOT ONLY FOCUS ON LEADERS BUT ON HOW PEOPLE ON AN EVERY DAY LEVEL ORDINARY PEOPLE LATCH ON TO THE IDEOLOGY.? ONE MUST ASK SHE SAYS WHY ??THE MAJORITY OF ORDINARY GERMANS BECAME PERPETRATORS.? BUT SHE ADDS ??IT HELPS TO UNDERSTAND HOW WORDS PUBLICATIONS AND HOW YOU??RE EDUCATED CAN ACTUALLY PREPARE YOU.? GIVING MEIN KAMPF A WELL-FOUNDED HISTORICAL CONTEXT MAY BE A WELL INTENTIONED PLAN. BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU LOSE THAT BATTLE FOR THE HEARTS AND MINDS? WHAT IF BY INTRODUCING THE BOOK YOU INADVERTENTLY INTRODUCE THE SEED OF EVIL AND EVEN HELP IT TO GROW? IN THE US ADOLF HITLER??S 800-PAGE RANT HAS BEEN FREELY AVAILABLE SINCE 1998. THAT HASN??T MADE NAZISM MORE PREVALENT IN AMERICA. OK. BUT ACCORDING TO THE 2014 FIGURES OF THE GERMAN SECURITY SERVICES GERMANY HARBORS AROUND 21.000 RIGHT WING EXTREMISTS OF WHOM 5600 ARE NEO-NAZIS. WILL THERE BE MORE NOW? HOW WILL REACTION TO THE REFUGEE CRISIS MIX WITH HITLER??S BIBLE OF HATE? NOBODY HAS THE ANSWER YET. AND IN THE MEANTIME HOW DOES ONE PROMOTE A BOOK LIKE THAT? ??YOU DON??T? SAYS THE INFORMATION CLERK AT A BRANCH OF THE MAJOR GERMAN BOOKSTORE CHAIN HUGENDUBEL. IN THE SHOP THERE ARE NO INDICATIONS THAT THE BOOK IS BEING SOLD AT ALL. ??WE ONLY SELL THEM BY PRE-ORDER? HE SAYS. THEY??VE HAD QUITE A FEW REQUESTS SO FAR HE SAYS. ??BUT YOU NEVER KNOW HOW LONG THAT WILL LAST. IT WAS IN THE NEWS YESTERDAY TODAY PEOPLE COME ASKING WHO KNOWS WHAT WILL HAPPEN?ŸTOMORROW?? ,7350.0

LET ME TELL YOU WHAT THE PROBLEM IS. IT??S NOT THAT THE PEOPLE NOMINATING ARE TOO WHITE? GOLDBERG SAID DEFENDING THE ACADEMY WHICH WAS 93% WHITE AND 76% MALE AS OF 2013. ??THE PROBLEM IS THE PEOPLE WHO CAN BE HELPING TO MAKE MOVIES THAT HAVE BLACKS AND LATINOS AND WOMEN AND ALL THAT THAT MONEY DOESN??T COME TO YOU BECAUSE THE IDEA IS THAT THERE??S NO PLACE FOR BLACK MOVIES.? UNTIL STUDIOS ARE WILLING TO MAKE MOVIES BESIDES THOSE LIKE THE AVENGERS WHERE YOU SEE ??70 WHITE PEOPLE SAVING THE EARTH? GOLDBERG SAID YOU WILL NOT SEE ANY CHANGE IN THE OSCAR NOMINATIONS. ??I AM MAD ABOUT THIS? SHE SAID. ??YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO BE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE SAVING THE EARTH BUT THEY??RE NOT COMING TO ME.? ??BOYCOTTING DOESN??T WORK AND IT??S ALSO A SLAP IN THE FACE OF CHRIS ROCK? GOLDBERG ADDED LATER. ??SO I??M NOT GOING TO BOYCOTT BUT I??M GOING TO CONTINUE TO BITCH AS I HAVE ALL YEAR ROUND BECAUSE I??M TIRED OF SEEING MOVIES WHERE NO ONE IS REPRESENTED EXCEPT A BIT OF THE POPULATION NOT ALL OF IT.? IF PEOPLE WANT TO BOYCOTT SOMETHING GOLDBERG SUGGESTED THEY TARGET THE MOVIES THAT DON??T REPRESENT PEOPLE OF COLOR ON SCREEN. ??THAT??S THE BOYCOTT YOU WANT!? SHE EXCLAIMED.

THE 14-YEAR-OLD DISNEY CHANNEL STAR RESPONDED TO THE #RILEYMATTHEWSBISEXUAL2K16 CAMPAIGN WHICH CALLED ON THE NETWORK TO ALLOW ITS PROTAGONIST TO EXPLORE HER SEXUALITY THIS SEASON. THE SHOW??A SPINOFF OF THE LATE-90S TGIF FAVORITE BOY MEETS WORLD??FOLLOWS COREY AND TOPANGA??S DAUGHTER RILEY AS SHE NAVIGATES WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A TEENAGER IN 2016. AS TWITTER USERS ARGUED TACKLING SEXUAL ORIENTATION IS A MAJOR PART OF THAT DISCUSSION. ROWAN BLANCHARD RESPONDED THAT SHE WELCOMES LGBT STORYLINES ON GIRL MEETS WORLD TWEETING THAT ??IT??S VVV IMPORTANT TO ME BEING QUEER THAT THERE IS REPRESENTATION ON OUR SHOW.? SHE EXPLAINED THAT WHILE SHE??S NEVER HAD A SAME-SEX RELATIONSHIP SHE??S ??OPEN TO LIKING ANY GENDER? IN THE FUTURE. ??[B]EING QUEER TO ME JUST MEANS NOT PUTTING A LABEL ON SEXUALITY??JUST EXISTING? BLANCHARD SAID. MS. BLANCHARD IS RIGHT: QUEER INCLUSION IS INCREDIBLY CRUCIAL FOR SHOWS LIKE GIRL MEETS WORLD AND COMPANIES LIKE DISNEY IN ORDER TO REPRESENT THE LIVED EXPERIENCES OF THE QUEEREST GENERATION IN HISTORY. AFTER ALL BLANCHARD CAME OUT ON TWITTER JUST DAYS AFTER HUNGER GAMES ACTRESS AMANDLA STERNBERG DISCLOSED HER SEXUALITY IN A SERIES OF SNAPCHATS FOR TEEN VOGUE. ??IT??S A REALLY REALLY HARD THING TO BE SILENCED AND IT??S DEEPLY BRUISING TO FIGHT AGAINST YOUR IDENTITY AND TO MOLD YOURSELF INTO SHAPES THAT YOU JUST SHOULDN??T BE IN? SHE SAID. ??AS SOMEONE WHO IDENTIFIES AS A BLACK BISEXUAL WOMAN I??VE BEEN THROUGH IT.? HISTORICALLY DISNEY ISN??T KNOWN FOR BEING PARTICULARLY FORWARD-THINKING WHEN IT COMES TO QUEER ISSUES. AS I WROTE IN AN OP-ED FOR THE GUARDIAN LAST YEAR DISNEY FREQUENTLY CODES ITS VILLAINS AS QUEER. IN CREATING THE CHARACTER OF URSULA FOR THE LITTLE MERMAID ANIMATORS BASED THE VOLUPTUOUS SEA-WITCH ON DIVINE THE FAMED 70S DRAG QUEEN WHO WAS A FREQUENT STAR IN JOHN WATERS?? FILMS. IN THE CASE OF THE LION KING??S SCAR IT??S NOT THAT THE CHARACTER ACTUALLY SLEEPS WITH MEN BUT AS DOCUMENTARIAN DAVID THROPE ARGUED THAT HIS EFFETE MANNERISMS SIGNIFY THAT HE??S AN OTHER. ??FILMS NEED VILLAINS? THORPE TOLD VICE ??AND FOR A VERY LONG TIME THE EFFETE ARISTOCRATIC EFFEMINATE MAN WAS THE VILLAIN.? HOWEVER THE COMPANY HAS BEEN TIPTOEING TOWARD INCLUSION IN RECENT YEARS AS THE REST OF THE ANIMATION INDUSTRY BECOMES MORE QUEER FRIENDLY. WHILE THE DISNEY CHANNEL??S GOOD LUCK CHARLIE INTRODUCED A STORYLINE FEATURING TWO LESBIAN MOMS IN 2014 THE SMASH HIT FROZEN ALSO WINKED AT GAY AUDIENCES. WHEN ANNA AND KRISTOFF STOP AT ??WANDERING OAKEN'S TRADING POST AND SAUNA? THE SHOPKEEPER IS SEEN BRIEFLY WAVING TO HIS FAMILY??OAKEN??S HUSBAND AND TWO KIDS. LAST YEAR NEWS BROKE THAT DISNEY WAS DEVELOPING PRINCES??A ROYAL ROMANCE THAT WOULD FEATURE ITS FIRST SAME-SEX COUPLE. (THE FILM WAS RUMORED BE AN ADAPTATION OF JEFFREY A. MILES?? CHILDREN'S BOOK THE PRINCES AND THE TREASURE.) THAT TURNED OUT TO BE A HOAX BUT AS SALLY KOHN WROTE IN THE NEW REPUBLIC THERE??S A REASON THE REPORT WENT VIRAL. ??IT WAS SHARED ON FACEBOOK MORE THAN 60000 TIMES? SHE SAID. ??NO DOUBT MANY OF THESE SHARES CAME FROM VILLAGERS FROM GLENBECKISTAN BUT MANY OTHERS WERE PROBABLY ELATED EAGER FOR A DISNEY FILM TO FINALLY REFLECT MODERN AMERICA.? SIX MONTHS AFTER THE SUPREME COURT MADE MARRIAGE EQUALITY THE LAW OF THE LAND A RECENT SURVEY FROM GALLUP SHOWED THAT ??ACCEPTANCE OF GAYS IS AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH.? BUT CERTAIN POPULATIONS PARTICULARLY NEED THIS GROUP OF SUPPORT. IN ADDITION TO TRANS PEOPLE WHO FACE HIGH RISKS OF VIOLENCE YOUNG QUEER PEOPLE ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY LIKELY TO BE HOMELESS. STATISTICS FROM UCLA??S WILLIAMS INSTITUTE SHOW THAT AROUND 4 IN 10 HOMELESS YOUTHS IDENTIFY AS LGBT. MANY OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE EJECTED FROM THEIR HOMES AFTER COMING OUT. MOST TEENAGE GIRLS ARE WORRIED ABOUT JUGGLING FRIENDS AND SCHOOLWORK BUT ACCORDING TO NBC 19-YEAR-OLD DIAMOND MARKS??A TRANS WOMAN OF COLOR??IS MOST CONCERNED ABOUT WHERE SHE??LL SLEEP NEXT WHETHER IT??S AT A FRIEND??S APARTMENT A SHELTER OR A PUBLIC PARK. DISNEY??S FIRST QUEER PROTAGONIST ISN??T THE ONLY SOLUTION TO THESE ISSUES. LGBT YOUTH NEED GREATER SUPPORT NETWORKS ACROSS THE COUNTRY??WHETHER THAT??S FROM SCHOOLS ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS OR LOCAL SERVICE PROVIDERS??BUT MEDIA REPRESENTATION IS ABSOLUTELY A PART OF THE MOVEMENT FOR ACCEPTANCE. PROGRAMS LIKE GIRL MEETS WORLD CAN OPEN UP A SPACE FOR CONVERSATIONS IN AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS BETWEEN PARENTS AND THEIR CHILDREN NORMALIZING QUEER SEXUALITY FOR THOSE WHO CONTINUE TO LACK CRUCIAL UNDERSTANDING. GIVEN THAT BLANCHARD IS JUST 14 AND THE SHOW??S TARGET AUDIENCE IS COMPRISED OF VERY YOUNG ADULTS MANY PARENTS MIGHT BE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH HAVING TEEN PROGRAMMING BROACH THESE SUBJECTS. AFTER AIRING THE LESBIAN-THEMED EPISODE THE CONSERVATIVE BACKLASH AGAINST GOOD LUCK CHARLIE WAS SO VITRIOLIC THAT THE SHOW??S STAR THEN FIVE-YEAR-OLD MIA TALERICO RECEIVED DEATH DEATHS FROM ANGRY FANS. IN A STATEMENT ONE MILLION MOMS URGED THE NETWORK TO ??AVOID CONTROVERSIAL TOPICS THAT CHILDREN ARE FAR TOO YOUNG TO COMPREHEND.? THE GROUP CONTINUED ??MATURE ISSUES OF THIS NATURE ARE BEING INTRODUCED TOO EARLY AND TOO SOON AND IT IS EXTREMELY UNNECESSARY.? THAT MIGHT DISSUADE DISNEY FROM FURTHER WADING INTO THOSE WATERS BUT IT SHOULDN??T: QUEER YOUTH ARE COMING OUT AT INCREASINGLY EARLY AGES??EVEN AS YOUNG AS MIDDLE AND ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. ??WHILE STUDIES IN THE 1970S DOCUMENTED LGBT PEOPLE COMING OUT ON AVERAGE IN THEIR EARLY TWENTIES THE LATEST RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THAT THE AVERAGE AGE HAS DROPPED TO ANYWHERE BETWEEN 14 AND 16? BUZZFEED??S SHANNON KEATING WRITES. OTHER ESTIMATES SUGGEST THAT THE AVERAGE AGE IS EVEN LOWER THAN THAT??AS YOUNG AS 13. PARENTS MIGHT THINK KIDS ??AREN??T OLD ENOUGH? TO GET IT BUT IF RILEY MATTHEWS WERE TO COME OUT THEY WOULD BE MORE LIKELY THAN EVER TO KNOW A STUDENT LIKE HER. THEY MIGHT EVEN BE A KID LIKE HER. SHOWS LIKE ABC FAMILY??S BOUNDARY-PUSHING DRAMA THE FOSTERS ARE ALREADY RECOGNIZING THAT REALITY. WHILE PREVIOUS STORYLINES FEATURING QUEER TEENS??LIKE RICKIE VASQUEZ ON MY SO-CALLED LIFE AND JACK MCPHEE ON DAWSON??S CREEK??CENTERED ON HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS THE SHOW??S JUDE AND CONNOR WERE JUST 13 WHEN THEY SHARED THEIR FIRST ONSCREEN KISS. THAT MIGHT MAKE THE PAIR THE YOUNGEST SAME-SEX COUPLE IN TELEVISION HISTORY BUT FOR THE TEENS WATCHING IT WASN??T JUST GROUNDBREAKING. IT WAS A CHANCE FOR TELEVISION TO FINALLY CATCH UP TO REALITY. IT??S INCREDIBLY EXCITING THAT ROWAN BLANCHARD CAME OUT??AND THAT THE INSPIRING YOUNG ACTRESS WILL BE PUTTING PRESSURE ON DISNEY TO HAVE HER CHARACTER FOLLOW SUIT. BUT WHAT??S MOST INSPIRING IS THAT GAY TEENS ARE DOING THE SAME EVERY DAY COMING OUT ON THEIR TWITTER AND FACEBOOK ACCOUNTS TO THEIR FRIENDS AND FAMILY. THOSE COURAGEOUS YOUTH DESERVE TO SEE A GIRL LIKE THEM ON EVERY TV IN AMERICA. ,14407.0

IF TRUMP DELIVERED THAT SPEECH IN CINCINNATI FRESH FROM ITS PLAYOFF LOSS FOLLOWING CONSECUTIVE PERSONAL FOUL CALLS HE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE LOCKED UP OHIO IN THE PRIMARY AND GENERAL. THERE??S MORE THAN MERE EMOTION TO TRUMP??S ASSERTION. FANS SAW 537 MORE PENALTY FLAGS IN 2015 THAN THEY DID IN 2009 ACCORDING TO NFLPENALTIES.COM. THAT GROWTH CAN BE DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTED TO THE 2010 REFORMS THAT ELIMINATED HELMET-TO-HELMET TACKLING AND HITS ON DEFENSELESS RECEIVERS THE ??BEAUTIFUL TACKLE? AS TRUMP WOULD SAY. WHILE PRE-SNAP PENALTIES SUCH AS OFFSIDES FELL 3 PERCENT UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS CALLS INCREASED 53 PERCENT DEFENSIVE HOLDING MORE THAN DOUBLED DEFENSIVE PASS INTERFERENCE WENT UP 25 PERCENT. REFS THREW 561 MORE FLAGS AGAINST DEFENDERS FOR THOSE THREE VIOLATIONS IN 2015 COMPARED TO 2009. TRUMP TOLD HIS FANS THAT ??I??LL BE CRITICIZED FOR THAT? IN LIGHT OF THE PEARL CLUTCHING OVER PLAYER SAFETY WHICH GREW IN VOLUME AFTER WILL SMITH??S CRITICALLY-ACCLAIMED FILM ??CONCUSSION? OPENED ON CHRISTMAS. THE MOVIE FOCUSES ON FOOTBALL??S RESISTANCE TO GROUNDBREAKING RESEARCH INTO THE LINK BETWEEN HEAD INJURIES AND CHRONIC TRAUMATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY A DEVASTATING FORM OF BRAIN DAMAGE LINKED TO THE DEATHS OF SEVERAL STARS. WRITERS IMAGINED THAT THE FILM WOULD HURT THE LEAGUE EVEN WORSE THAN THE $765 MILLION LAWSUIT THAT THE LEAGUE SETTLED WITH 4500 FORMER PLAYERS. THE FILMMAKERS PRACTICALLY BEGGED FOR A LAWSUIT USING TEAM AND LEAGUE LOGOS AND BACKDROPS WITHOUT PERMISSION AS LUKE WILSON??S ROGER GOODELL DANCES AROUND THE ISSUE AT A PRESS CONFERENCE.?Ÿ ??SONY DID A REMARKABLE THING. THEY GOT RIGHTEOUS AND AGGRESSIVE SAID ??GOD DAMMIT IF THEY WANT TO SUE US THEY CAN.?? IF THEY SUED THAT WOULD BE A GOOD STORY IN ITSELF? WRITER-DIRECTOR PETER LANDESMAN TOLD SHOWBIZ411. ??WE GOT TO SHOW HOW BEAUTIFUL THE GAME IS. WE WANT PEOPLE TO WALK OUT [AND THINK ABOUT FOOTBALL] IT??S BEAUTIFUL AND IT WILL KILL YOU.? ONE WOULD EXPECT ??CONCUSSION? TO GENERATE A GREATER PR OFFENSIVE. THE ENTIRE SPORT IS ON TRIAL. THE WORLD??S BIGGEST MOVIE STAR IS SAYING HE WON??T LET HIS SON PLAY FOOTBALL. YET THE NFL DOESN??T SEEM TO HAVE AN UNKIND WORD IN ITS BODY.?Ÿ ??WE WELCOME ANY CONVERSATION ABOUT PLAYER HEALTH AND SAFETY? A LEAGUE SPOKESMAN TOLD SPORTS ILLUSTRATED WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE FILM. ??BROADER AND DEEPER AWARENESS OF THESE ISSUES WILL POSITIVELY IMPACT ALL ATHLETES.? IT??S A CURIOUS RESPONSE UNTIL YOU CONSIDER THAT THE NFL LOVES TALKING ABOUT PLAYER SAFETY. MANY OBSERVERS AND FORMER PLAYERS ATTRIBUTE THE FOCUS ON PLAYER SAFETY TO NFL EFFORTS TO EXPAND ITS FEMALE AUDIENCE WHICH HAS DOUBLED IN RECENT YEARS. A 2012 WASHINGTON POST POLL FOUND THAT WOMEN WERE 30 PERCENT MORE LIKELY THAN MEN TO SAY ??SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE? TO CUT DOWN ON CONCUSSIONS.?Ÿ BUT APPEALING TO WOMEN??THE LARGEST UNTAPPED MARKET AND A DEMOGRAPHIC CHERISHED BY ADVERTISERS??IS JUST A SIDE BENEFIT. THE REAL REASON THE NFL OWNERS LOVE TO FOCUS ON SAFETY IS BECAUSE IT ALLOWS THEM TO IGNORE THE LACK OF PROTECTION IN PLAYER CONTRACTS. ONLY ABOUT HALF OF NFL CONTRACT MONEY IS GUARANTEED AGAINST INJURY OR SKILL-RELATED DECLINE IN AMERICA??S MOST VIOLENT SPORT AND TEAM OWNERS PRESSURE ONE ANOTHER TO KEEP IT THAT WAY. THEY OFFER SIGNING BONUSES AND INCENTIVE-LADEN DEALS RATHER THAN GIVING PLAYERS ACTUAL SECURITY. THE LEAGUE REPORTED A 36 PERCENT DROP IN HEAD INJURIES BETWEEN 2012 AND 2014. THIS DID NOT MAKE THE GAME ANY SAFER FROM OTHER SIGNIFICANT INJURIES THE NUMBER OF PLAYERS PLACED ON INJURED RESERVE??TYPICALLY USED FOR SEASON-ENDING INJURY??ACTUALLY INCREASED BY ABOUT 20 PERCENT FROM 2013 TO 2014. MORE THAN 460 PLAYERS WERE PLACED ON IR THIS YEAR UP FROM 388 IN 2009.?Ÿ LEG INJURIES WERE THE MOST COMMON REASON FOR IR DESIGNATIONS NO SURPRISE AS THE PLAYERS TRY TO AVOID PENALTIES FOR HIGH TACKLES. AN NFL PLAYER EARNS HIS LIVING ON HIS LEGS WHICH IS WHY A BAD KNEE IS MORE LIKELY TO END A CAREER THAN A HEAD INJURY. A PLAYER WHO SUFFERS A SEASON-ENDING KNEE INJURY WILL CONTINUE TO GET PAID DURING THE RECOVERY TIME PRESCRIBED BY TEAM DOCTORS. THAT ONLY LASTS DURING THE SEASON IN WHICH THE INJURY OCCURS. IF HE LOSES A STEP GOING INTO THE FOLLOWING SEASON THE TEAM CAN CUT HIM NO MATTER HOW MANY YEARS ARE LEFT ON THE CONTRACT AND POCKET WHATEVER IS NOT GUARANTEED. NICE WORDS ABOUT SAFETY COVER UP THE FACT THAT THE LEAGUE CONTINUES TO SHORTCHANGE PLAYERS. OWNERS ARE DEALING FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH AND THEY KNOW IT. THERE??S NO RIVAL LEAGUE. THE NFL PLAYER??S ASSOCIATION THAT NEGOTIATES CONTRACTS IS A ??JV TEAM? AT BEST AS ONE LEAGUE OBSERVER TOLD ESPN. THE BILLIONAIRE TEAM OWNERS ALSO REALIZE THAT THE AVERAGE AMERICAN SEES MILLIONAIRE NFL PLAYERS AS SPOILED.?Ÿ IT??S TOUGH TO SYMPATHIZE WITH SOMEONE WHOSE MINIMUM WAGE CATAPULTS HIM INTO THE ONE PERCENT. BUT WE SHOULD CARE. THESE MEN HAVE BUILT FOOTBALL INTO A $13 BILLION INDUSTRY. THEY DO SO AT GREAT PERSONAL RISK WHICH WILL NOT DIMINISH AS LONG AS FOOTBALL REMAINS A CONTACT SPORT. IF YOU CAN??T BRING YOURSELF TO DO SO FOR PLAYER JUSTICE THEN DO IT FOR YOURSELF AS A FAN. IF YOU??RE TIRED OF REFEREES DECIDING THE OUTCOME OF GAMES IF YOU MISS THE ??BEAUTIFUL TACKLE? IF YOU??RE FRUSTRATED BY PLAYERS FAILING TO DIVE FOR A BALL BECAUSE THEY FEAR INJURY THEN YOU SHOULD DEMAND GUARANTEED CONTRACTS.?Ÿ NFL PLAYERS HAVE NOT GONE SOFT THEIR UNION HAS. IT WILL HAVE CONSEQUENCES GOING FORWARD ACCORDING TO TRUMP. ??IT??S GOING TO AFFECT THE NFL. I DON??T EVEN WATCH IT AS MUCH ANYMORE. IT??S GOING TO AFFECT THE NFL. I DON??T WATCH IT. THE REFEREES THEY WANT TO ALL THROW FLAGS SO THEIR WIVES SEE THEM AT HOME. ??OH THERE??S MY HUSBAND.?? IT??S TRUE. ??HE JUST BROKE UP ?? HE JUST GAVE A 15-YARD PENALTY ON ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL TACKLES MADE THIS YEAR.?? RIGHT?? RIGHT. HERE??S HOPING THAT MR.

EDWARD GEIER WAS CONVICTED LAST WEEK OF 1074 COUNTS OF RAPE AND MOLESTATION FOR ABUSING HIS SISTER AND STEP-DAUGHTER. THE TRIAL LASTED TWO AND A HALF DAYS AND IT TOOK THE JURY JUST A FEW HOURS OF DELIBERATION TO DECIDE HE WAS GUILTY. WHILE HE FACES LIFE IN PRISON HIS MOTHER IS NOT FACING ANY CHARGES FOR TELLING HER DAUGHTER NOT TO REPORT GEIER??S RAPE TO POLICE??AND EVEN TELLING HER TO RECANT HER ACCUSATION AFTER SHE DID TELL COPS. SHE MIGHT NEVER HAVE COME FORWARD HAD HER STEPSISTER NOT FLED GEIER??S ABUSE. IN AUGUST 2014 STATE POLICE FOUND GEIER??S 13-YEAR-OLD STEP-DAUGHTER WALKING DOWN STATE ROAD 45 JUST BEFORE MIDNIGHT FIVE MILES FROM HER HOME IN CENTRAL PENNSYLVANIA. OFFICERS WERE RESPONDING TO A CALLER WHO REPORTED SEEING A CHILD TRUDGING ALONE ALONG THE DARK ROUTE CARRYING SUITCASES. THE GIRL TOLD POLICE SHE COULD NOT GO BACK TO HER HOME BECAUSE HER STEP-FATHER HAD BEEN RAPING HER THERE FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS MOST RECENTLY A FEW DAYS EARLIER. SHE TOLD POLICE GEIER??S ABUSE BEGAN WHEN SHE WAS 9 WITH FONDLING AND PROGRESSED TO SEXUAL INTERCOURSE. WHEN POLICE SERVED A WARRANT TO SEARCH GEIER??S HOME HE DID NOT DENY THE ACCUSATIONS. ACCORDING TO THE CRIMINAL COMPLAINT HE ??INSISTED POLICE WOULD NOT FIND ANY DNA EVIDENCE LINKED TO HIM IN THE VICTIM??S BEDROOM.? BUT INVESTIGATORS DID FIND GEIER??S BODILY FLUIDS INCLUDING SEMEN IN MULTIPLE LOCATIONS IN THE VICTIM??S BEDROOM WHICH ALIGNED WITH HER ACCOUNT OF THE YEARS OF ABUSE. TESTING REVEALED THE FLUID CONTAINED BOTH GEIER??S AND THE VICTIM??S DNA. POLICE ARRESTED GEIER ON FEBRUARY 24 2015 AND CHARGED HIM WITH MULTIPLE COUNTS OF 10 FELONIES ?ŸFOR THE FOUR YEARS OF ABUSE TO WHICH HE SUBJECTED HIS STEP-DAUGHTER. CHARGES INCLUDED RAPE OF A CHILD STATUTORY SEXUAL ASSAULT UNLAWFUL CONTACT WITH A MINOR INVOLUNTARY DEVIATE SEXUAL INTERCOURSE WITH A PERSON LESS THAN 16 AND INVOLUNTARY DEVIATE SEXUAL INTERCOURSE BY FORCIBLE COMPULSION AMONG OTHERS. THE VICTIM??S STEP-GRANDMOTHER MIGHT HAVE SPARED HER FOUR YEARS OF HORROR. IN 2003 SHE TALKED HER OWN DAUGHTER GEIER??S 14-YEAR-OLD SISTER OUT OF CALLING THE POLICE AFTER HE RAPED HER IN HIS OWN SON??S BED. GEIER??S SISTER ONLY FELT SAFE COMING FORWARD AFTER HE WAS ARRESTED SHE TOLD POLICE IN APRIL 2014. SHE SAID GEIER ASSAULTED HER TWICE. THE FIRST TIME SHE WAS BABYSITTING GEIER??S SON IN 2003 FOR THE NIGHT AND FELL ASLEEP WITH THE TYKE THEN AWOKE TO GEIER RAPING HER. SHE TOLD POLICE THAT GEIER ?ŸCLAIMED HE WAS DRUNK AND THOUGHT SHE WAS SOMEONE ELSE. GEIER??S SISTER SAID THE SECOND ASSAULT OCCURRED IN 2007 AT HER HOME. GEIER REACHED UNDER THE VICTIM??S SHIRT AND TOUCHED HER BREASTS. ACCORDING TO A PRESS RELEASE FROM THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY??S OFFICE WHEN SHE TRIED TO PUSH HIM AWAY GEIER ??TOLD HER IT WAS OKAY BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT FULL-BLOOD RELATIVES.\ THE VICTIM TOLD POLICE SHE??D WANTED TO REPORT THE RAPE BUT WAS CONVINCED BY HER MOTHER NOT TO TURN HER BROTHER IN TO AUTHORITIES. SHE SAID HER MOM EVEN PRESSURED HER TO RECANT AFTER SHE REPORTED THE ASSAULT TO POLICE AT HER SCHOOL. A SPOKESPERSON FOR DISTRICT ATTORNEY STACY PARKS MILLER TOLD THE DAILY BEAST THAT NO CHARGES HAVE BEEN FILED AGAINST THE MOTHER AT THIS TIME EVEN THOUGH HER ALLEGED COERCION OF HER DAUGHTER NOT TO REPORT THE CRIME COULD RISE TO THE LEVEL OF A FELONY.

IF THE GANG OF AGING CRIMINALS HAD REMAINED TRUE TO THEIR ORIGINAL PLAN FOR ONE LAST JOB WHICH HAD BEEN PAINSTAKINGLY HONED OVER MORE THAN A YEAR THEY MIGHT STILL BE ENJOYING THEIR RETIREMENTS. INSTEAD THEY CAN EXPECT TO SPEND THE REST OF THEIR LIVES BEHIND BARS. THE CONCLUSION OF THE TRIAL OF THE MEN ACCUSED OF BEING INVOLVED IN BRITAIN??S BIGGEST BURGLARY CAME ON THURSDAY WHEN THREE ACCOMPLICES WERE FOUND GUILTY AND ONE MAN WAS ACQUITTED. THE ??HATTON GARDEN RAID?? WHICH TOOK PLACE OVER LAST EASTER SAW THIEVES STEAL THE JEWELS FROM SAFE DEPOSIT BOXES AFTER BORING INTO A VAULT. DETECTIVE CONSTABLE JAMIE DAY WHO WAS THE FIRST OFFICER AT THE SCENE FROM SCOTLAND YARD??S ELITE FLYING SQUAD SAID THEY HAD CRACKED THE SILENCE AROUND THE BREAK-IN BY IDENTIFYING A CAR THAT WAS NEVER SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE HEIST. A WHITE MERCEDES WAS USED BRIEFLY TO OBSERVE THE SCENE BEFORE SOME OF THE VILLAINS RETURNED TO THE HATTON GARDEN SAFETY DEPOSIT FOR A SECOND NIGHT??AGAINST THE WISHES OF READER. READER WHO WAS LINKED TO THE KILLING OF A POLICE OFFICER IN 1985 DEMANDED THAT THE GANG WALK AWAY ONCE A PIECE OF EQUIPMENT HAD FAILED ON THE FIRST NIGHT OF THE RAID. HIS COMRADES WHO WOULD LATER CALL HIM AN ??OLD PONCE? FOR REFUSING TO GO BACK IMPROVISED THE USE OF THE CAR WITHOUT HIS APPROVAL. THE MERCEDES WAS NOT REGISTERED TO ANY OF THE CRIMINALS BUT NUMBER PLATE RECOGNITION CAMERAS SET-UP AROUND LONDON GAVE DETECTIVES A PATTERN TO FOLLOW IN THE WEEKS AFTER THE DIAMOND RAID. ??IF A VEHICLE GOES FROM A TO B AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME EVERY DAY. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS WAIT FOR IT? DAY TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. ONCE THEY WERE ON THE TRAIL OF THE CAR THEY HAD EFFECTIVELY IDENTIFIED THE FIRST MEMBER OF THE GANG??JOHN COLLINS. THEY LATER PLACED SURVEILLANCE DEVICES INSIDE THAT CAR AND A SECOND VEHICLE. THEY COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE THEIR LUCK WHEN THE GANG PROCEEDED TO BRAG ABOUT THEIR RECORD-BREAKING HAUL. AFTER ONE FRIDAY NIGHT SPENT EATING FISH AND CHIPS AND DRINKING IN THE CASTLE PUB IN ISLINGTON READER CAUGHT THE TUBE AND THE OTHERS GOT BACK INTO THE CARS. ??ON THE WAY HOME HAVING HAD A LITTLE BIT MORE ALCOHOL THEY WERE A LITTLE BIT MORE FLUID WITH THEIR OPINIONS? SAID DAY. ??THAT??S OBVIOUSLY QUITE USEFUL FOR US AS WELL.? WITH READER SAFELY OUT OF EARSHOT TWO MEMBERS OF THE GANG SAID THEY WERE GOING TO CONFRONT THE OLD GANGSTER FOR DECLINING TO RETURN TO THE SAFE EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD NOT MANAGED TO STEAL ANYTHING ON NIGHT ONE. AFTER SUCCESSFULLY BREAKING INTO THE BUILDING CLIMBING DOWN A LIFT SHAFT AND DRILLING THROUGH THE 20-INCH CEMENT WALL OF THE SAFE THEY FELL AT THE FINAL HURDLE WHEN A PUMP FAILED AS THEY TRIED TO PUNCH THROUGH A WALL OF SAFETY DEPOSIT BOXES. ON THE SECOND NIGHT THE SMALLER BAND RETURNED WITH MORE EQUIPMENT??AND LEFT WITH CASH GOLD AND DIAMONDS WORTH $20 MILLION. THEY WERE CONVINCED THAT THEY HAD PROVED READER WRONG. ??YOU GAVE UP BEING A THIEF TEN YEARS AGO YOU CUNT? SAID TERRY PERKINS 67 IMAGINING THE CONFRONTATION. DANIEL JONES 60 JOINED IN. ??HE WAS A THIEF FORTY YEARS AGO THEY NEVER TOOK NO CHANCES HAD IT ALL THEIR OWN WAY. LIKE ALL THEM THIEVES THEN? HE SAID. THESE SENTIMENTS WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN SHARED WITH READER. AT LEAST NOT UNTIL THEY WERE PLAYED OUT LOUD IN A SOUTH LONDON COURT. READER MAY BE IN HIS MID 70S BUT HE IS A FEARSOME CHARACTER. AFTER THE CONCLUSION OF THE TRIAL IT CAN NOW BE REPORTED THAT READER WAS ONCE A CLOSE ASSOCIATE OF KENNETH NOYE A SAVAGE GANG BOSS WHO IS SERVING LIFE IN PRISON FOR MURDER. IN 1985 A POLICE SURVEILLANCE OFFICER WHO WAS FOLLOWING READER AND NOYE WAS STABBED TO DEATH. DETECTIVES JOHN FORDHAM AND NEIL MURPHY WERE WATCHING THE MEN BECAUSE OF THEIR SUSPECTED INVOLVEMENT IN DISPERSING THE PROCEEDS OF THE LEGENDARY BRINK??S MAT ARMED ROBBERY IN WHICH CASH AND GOLD WORTH $35 MILLION WERE STOLEN FROM A WAREHOUSE NEAR HEATHROW AIRPORT. MURPHY WOULD LATER TELL THE GUARDIAN THAT READER KICKED HIS COLLEAGUE AS HE LAY DYING ON THE GROUND. NOYE HAD STABBED THE OFFICER 11 TIMES. BOTH MEN ESCAPED JAIL WHEN THE JURY ACCEPTED NOYE??S PLEA THAT HE HAD ACTED IN SELF-DEFENSE??NOT KNOWING WHY THE PLAIN-CLOTHED OFFICER HAD SNUCK ONTO HIS PROPERTY. READER WAS LATER JAILED FOR NINE YEARS FOR HIS PART IN THE BRINK??S MAT ROBBERY. NOYE WAS CONVICTED OF MURDER FOR A SEPARATE FATAL STABBING IN 2000. SUCH WAS READER??S CRIMINAL EXPERTISE THAT THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE OVER-THE-HILL MOB REFERRED TO HIM AS ??THE GUV??NOR?? OR ??THE MASTER.?? THE OTHERS WERE NO CRIMINAL APPRENTICES HOWEVER. THEY ALL HAD LONG CRIMINAL HISTORIES. PERKINS A FORMER CANDY STORE OWNER WAS INVOLVED IN ANOTHER OF BRITAIN??S MOST NOTORIOUS ROBBERIES. HE WAS SENTENCED TO 22 YEARS IMPRISONMENT FOR THE SECURITY EXPRESS ROBBERY THAT WAS PLANNED IN AN OLD EAST END BOOZER CALLED THE FOX. THE PUB WAS OWNED BY THE INFAMOUS KNIGHT BROTHERS??ONE OF WHOM WAS MARRIED TO CARRY ON MOVIE STAR BARBARA WINDSOR. BANK NOTES WORTH MORE THAN $8 MILLION WAS STOLEN FROM THE EAST LONDON DEPOT BUT PERKINS AND TWO OF THE KNIGHT BROTHERS WERE EVENTUALLY APPREHENDED AND JAILED. AT A SCOTLAND YARD BRIEFING FLYING SQUAD?ŸDETECTIVE CHIEF INSPECTOR?ŸPAUL JOHNSON SAID IT WAS NO SURPRISE TO HIM AND HIS COLLEAGUES WHEN THE WHITE MERCEDES LED THEM TO PERKINS AND READER. ??YOU GET THIS REPEATED PATTERN? HE SAID. ??ALL THEY KNOW IS ARMED ROBBERY AND YOU ALWAYS GET A PATTERN WHEN THAT SORT OF PERSON CROPS UP ON ANOTHER JOB... THE SAME PEOPLE THE SAME FACES.? SENTENCING FOR HATTON GARDEN WILL BEGIN ON MARCH 7. ??THE GUV??NOR?? MUST BE WISHING HE??D CHOSEN A DIFFERENT SET OF FACES. ,19228.0

FOR SVETLANA A 47-YEAR-OLD TEACHER THAT GLOOMY MONDAY WAS ESPECIALLY MEMORABLE: SHE HEARD THE WORDS THAT CLOSED OFF HER DREAMS FOR THE FUTURE LIKE THE NAILED-DOWN LID OF A COFFIN: ??YOU HAVE HIV? SAID THE PHYSICIAN SHE??D GONE TO SEE. ??I AM YOUR DOCTOR FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.? HIS TONE WAS LIKE ICE. WHEN SVETLANA WALKED OUT OF THE REGIONAL PROPHYLACTIC CENTER FOR AIDS HER BEST FRIEND WAITING FOR HER IN THE CAR NOTICED THAT SVETLANA??S FACE LOOKED GRAY HER EYES SUNKEN. SVETLANA WAS BEGINNING TO WITHDRAW DEEPLY INTO HER OWN TROUBLES AND FROM THAT DAY REFUSED TO DISCUSS HER HEALTH ISSUES DENYING THAT SHE HAD EVER BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH HIV. ??I AM HEALTHY LET ME LIVE MY LIFE? SHE TOLD HER FRIENDS. THE CENTER THAT SO FRIGHTENED SVETLANA WAS THE ONLY STATE INSTITUTION TREATING HIV AND AIDS PATIENTS IN A CITY OF 1.3 MILLION PEOPLE. ITS WEB SITE HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED SINCE 2011. UNDER ??ABOUT THE CENTER? IT SAYS THAT THERE WERE 8534 HIV POSITIVE CITIZENS IN NIZHNY NOVGOROD?? BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE. IN FACT LAST YEAR THERE WERE MORE THAN 14000 PATIENTS WITH AN INCREASING NUMBER OF ORDINARY WOMEN GETTING INFECTED THROUGH SEX. NATIONWIDE IN 2014 RUSSIA COUNTED 90000 NEW CASES THE FASTEST GROWING HIV/AIDS EPIDEMIC IN EUROPE. LAST YEAR THE FAST-SHRINKING CITY OF NIZHNY NOVGOROD LOST ITS CITY MANAGER. THE KREMLIN??S PARTY UNITED RUSSIA FINALLY DECIDED TO RID OF MAYOR OLEG SOROKIN WHO WAS FAMOUS FOR HIS CORRUPTION HUGE VILLAS ON THE FRENCH RIVIERA AND POOR WORK. DIRT BROKEN PEDESTRIAN WALKWAYS POOR ILLUMINATION AND MISERABLE MEDICAL SERVICE WERE THE REMARKABLE FEATURES OF A CITY WITH A 794-YEAR HISTORY. BUT THERE WERE NO SOCIAL PROTESTS. PEOPLE WERE AFRAID. SO SOMEHOW THEY TOLERATED THEIR CITY??S DECLINE. EVEN GREATER FEAR PARALYZED PEOPLE WITH HIV AND AIDS WHO LIKE SVETLANA WERE TOO SCARED TO TAKE A BLOOD TEST OR SEEK PROPER TREATMENT SINCE A POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS IMMEDIATELY TURNED THEIR LIVES INTO HELL. UNDER RUSSIA??S CRIMINAL CODE ARTICLE 122 RUSSIANS WITH HIV OR AIDS CAN GOT TO JAIL FOR THREE YEARS FOR DELIBERATELY PASSING INFECTION TO OTHER PEOPLE. PRISON IS A SURER BET THAN MEDICAL TREATMENT. CITIZEN WITH HIV OR AIDS CANNOT BE ADMITTED TO ANY ORDINARY CLINIC ONLY TO SPECIALIZED CENTERS OFTEN GRIM AND MISERABLE PLACES SIMILAR TO THE ONE VISITED BY SVETLANA. NOW SHE HAD TO FORGET ABOUT A LITTLE PLASTIC SURGERY ON HER EYES THAT SHE??D BEEN SAVING FOR. NO SURGEON IN NIZHNY NOVGOROD WOULD AGREE TO OPERATE ON HER WITH HIV. MOSCOW??S CIVIL SOCIETY IS BRAVER. CIVIL ACTIVISTS PUSHED THE KREMLIN TO CHANGE THE LEGISLATION TO PUNISH DOCTORS WHO REFUSE TO TREAT HIV POSITIVE PATIENTS. ANTON KRASOVSKY A LEADER OF THE AIDS CENTER WORKING AROUND MOSCOW AND THE MOSCOW REGION TOLD THE DAILY BEAST ??MOST RUSSIAN DOCTORS TERRIFY PATIENTS WITH HIV AND AIDS. THE DIAGNOSIS IS OFTEN PRONOUNCED AS IF YOUR LIFE IS HOPELESSLY DOOMED? HE SAID. YET AT THE SAME TIME THERE HAS BEEN A STUBBORN REFUSAL TO ADMIT THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM. ??LAST YEAR WE HAD A REVOLUTIONARY BREAKTHROUGH? SAID KRASOVSKY. ??WE FINALLY FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER HEARD THE WORDS ??HIV EPIDEMIC?? FROM A HIGH KREMLIN OFFICIAL.? AT A RECENT GOVERNMENT MEETING PRIME MINISTER DMITRY MEDVEDEV ADMITTED THAT THERE WAS A GROWING PROBLEM. IN FACT BECAUSE THEY FEARED THEY??D BECOME HUMILIATED OUTCASTS THOUSANDS OF RUSSIANS ESPECIALLY DRUG ADDICTS PREFERRED NOT TO KNOW WHETHER THEY HAD HIV AND INSTEAD OF RECEIVING THE RIGHT TREATMENT CONTINUED TO SPREAD THE EPIDEMIC. OFTEN REGIONAL HIV/AIDS CENTERS HAVE NOT PROVIDED PATIENTS WITH PROPER MEDICINE. ??THAT THREATENS NOT ONLY HIV PATIENTS?? LIVES BUT THE LIVES OF HEALTHY PEOPLE TOO? MEDVEDEV ADMITTED. OFFICIALLY 986657 RUSSIANS ARE HIV/AIDS PATIENTS ??BUT NON-OFFICIALLY IT IS MORE LIKELY UP TO 1.5 MILLION PEOPLE? KRASOVSKY SAID. CANCER IS ALSO A HUGE PROBLEM. RUSSIA AND CHINA ARE THE WORLD LEADERS WITH 122.5 PEOPLE PER 100000 DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER AND 2015 WILL BE REMEMBERED AS THE YEAR WHEN RUSSIA GAINED HEIGHTENED AWARENESS OF SUICIDE CASES AMONG CANCER PATIENTS OF OLDER PEOPLE WHO KILLED THEMSELVES AFTER MONTHS OF PAINFUL SUFFERING. IN SOME SOCIETIES PHILANTHROPISTS MIGHT TRY TO TAKE UP THE SLACK LEFT BY GOVERNMENT FAILINGS. IN RUSSIA WE DON??T REALLY SEE THAT. MORE OFTEN WE SEE CASES LIKE THE DEPUTY OF THE ST. PETERSBURG PARLIAMENT VITALY MILONOV WHO WAS SPOTTED WEARING A WATCH THAT COST MORE THAN $10000. IN THE PAST MILONOV WAS FAMOUS FOR DESCRIBING HOMOSEXUALS AS ??SICK? AND FOR TRYING TO TAKE LADY GAGA AND MADONNA TO RUSSIAN COURT. DID THE DEPUTY FEEL ASHAMED FOR WEARING A WATCH THAT WAS WORTH MORE THAN AN AVERAGE RUSSIAN??S ANNUAL INCOME? ??I WANT TO SPIT IN THE FACES OF THESE INVESTIGATORS? DEPUTY MILONOV RESPONDED. AT THE STREET LEVEL A SOCIAL STRUGGLE AGAINST THE HIV EPIDEMIC HAD A CHANCE TO BECOME A POPULAR TREND. THE FIGURES DID SOUND THREATENING: RUSSIA COUNTED ABOUT 10000 NEW HIV/AIDS POSITIVE CASES EVERY YEAR MAINLY IN THE 20 TO 50 AGE GROUP. BY THE END OF 2015 THE FEDERAL SERVICE FOR SURVEILLANCE ON CONSUMER RIGHTS PROTECTION AND HUMAN WELLBEING CONFIRMED: RUSSIA WAS FACING AN OVERWHELMING HIV/AIDS EPIDEMIC WITH NUMBERS GROWING IN CITIES LIKE NIZHNY NOVGOROD MORE THAN 30 PERCENT FASTER THAN IN 2014. THE RUSSIAN HEALTH MINISTRY WARNED: BY 2020 THE EPIDEMICS COULD JUMP BY 250 PERCENT. KRASOVSKY SAID THAT HIS AIDS CENTER WOULD DO EVERYTHING TO PUSH THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT TO DE-STIGMATIZE THE DISEASE AND REFORM ITS APPROACH TO HIV/AIDS. THANKS TO CIVIL MOVEMENTS AND THE EFFORT OF LEADING DOCTORS THE MOSCOW REGIONAL CENTER ON AIDS MANAGED TO ENLARGE ITS FACILITIES BY MORE THAN 400 SQUARE METERS. BUT EVEN A 1000-SQUARE-METER CLINIC WAS TOO SMALL FOR FOR 39000 PEOPLE OF MOSCOW REGION WITH HIV AND AIDS. ??OUR PRIORITY IS TO MAKE RUSSIA REALIZE THAT THERE ARE NO SECOND QUALITY PEOPLE EVERYBODY HAS EQUAL RIGHTS TO BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY? KRASOVSKY SAID. ,7789.0

196,9655238.0,2016-01-05T23:21:00+00:00,BLAME PAKISTANI SPY SERVICE FOR ATTACK ON INDIAN AIR FORCE BASE,THE PAKISTANI INTELLIGENCE SERVICE IS BEHIND THE RECENT ATTACK ON A MAJOR INDIAN AIR FORCE BASE IN PUNJAB USING A TERRORIST GROUP IT CREATED 15 YEARS AGO ACCORDING TO WELL-INFORMED PRESS AND OTHER KNOWLEDGEABLE SOURCES. THE ATTACK IS DESIGNED TO PREVENT ANY DETENTE BETWEEN INDIA AND PAKISTAN AFTER PRIME MINISTER NARENDRA MODI??S SURPRISE CHRISTMAS DAY VISIT TO PAKISTAN. THE ESCALATING VIOLENCE BETWEEN THE TWO NUCLEAR-WEAPONS STATES WHICH HAVE ALREADY FOUGHT FOUR WARS THREATENS TO GET WORSE. THE PAKISTANI INTELLIGENCE SERVICE HAS THE CAPABILITY TO LAUNCH MORE ATTACKS WITH LITTLE NOTICE AT SOME POINT PROMPTING A VIGOROUS INDIAN RESPONSE. ON DEC. 31 A TEAM OF TERRORISTS INFILTRATED ACROSS THE PAKISTANI BORDER INTO INDIA. ON SATURDAY THEY ASSAULTED THE PATHANKOT AIR BASE ONE OF INDIA??S LARGEST AIR FORCE INSTALLATIONS NEAR THE BORDER. AT LEAST SEVEN INDIAN SOLDIERS WERE KILLED IN THE FIGHTING WHICH LASTED FOR DAYS. ON SUNDAY THE INDIAN CONSULATE IN MAZAR-E SHARIF IN NORTHERN AFGHANISTAN WAS ALSO ATTACKED BY GUNMEN. BOTH ATTACKS ARE THE WORK OF THE PAKISTANI TERROR GROUP JAISH E MUHAMMAD ACCORDING TO RELIABLE PRESS REPORTS. JEM WAS CREATED IN 2000 BY MUALANA MASOUD AZHAR A LONGTIME PAKISTANI TERRORIST LEADER. AZHAR WAS CAPTURED IN INDIA IN 1994 AFTER TAKING WESTERN HOSTAGES IN KASHMIR. IN DECEMBER 1999 A GROUP OF TERRORISTS HIJACKED AN AIR INDIA JET FLYING FROM NEPAL TO INDIA AND DIVERTED IT TO AFGHANISTAN. THEY DEMANDED THE RELEASE OF AZHAR AND HIS COLLEAGUES IN RETURN FOR THE PASSENGERS AND CREW. AND THEY GOT IT THANKS TO HELP FROM THE PAKISTANI INTELLIGENCE SERVICE ISI AND AL QAEDA LEADER OSAMA BIN LADEN ACCORDING TO ACCOUNTS OF THE HIJACKING BASED ON THE INDIAN OFFICIALS WHO NEGOTIATED WITH THE TERRORISTS FOR THE HOSTAGES?? FREEDOM. THE AFGHAN TALIBAN ASSISTED THE HIJACKERS ONCE THEY GOT TO AFGHANISTAN. ONCE AZHAR WAS TRADED FOR THE HOSTAGES THE ISI TOOK HIM ON A PUBLIC VICTORY TOUR THROUGH PAKISTAN TO RAISE MONEY FOR THE JIHAD AGAINST INDIA AND HE ANNOUNCED THE FORMATION OF JAISH E MUHAMMAD OR THE ARMY OF MUHAMMAD IN EARLY 2000. JEM RECEIVED TRAINING AND WEAPONS FROM THE ISI AND WORKED CLOSELY WITH AL QAEDA. IN DECEMBER 2001 JEM TERRORISTS WORKING WITH TERRORISTS FROM ANOTHER ISI-BACKED GROUP LASHKAR E TAYYIBA (LET) ATTACKED THE INDIAN PARLIAMENT BUILDING IN NEW DELHI. THAT ATTACK PROMPTED INDIA TO MOBILIZE ITS MILITARY AND A TENSE STANDOFF WENT ON FOR NINE MONTHS. ONLY INTENSE MEDIATION BY PRESIDENT BUSH??S NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM AVERTED WAR. AZHAR KEPT A LOW PROFILE FOR SEVERAL YEARS AFTER LET??S 2008 ATTACK ON MUMBAI BUT HE REAPPEARED PUBLICLY IN 2014 GIVING FIERY CALLS FOR MORE ATTACKS ON INDIA AND THE UNITED STATES. HIS GROUP IS TECHNICALLY ILLEGAL IN PAKISTAN BUT ENJOYS THE CONTINUING PATRONAGE OF THE ISI. THE ISI IS UNDER THE GENERALS?? COMMAND AND IS COMPOSED OF ARMY OFFICERS SO THE SPIES ARE CONTROLLED BY THE PAKISTANI ARMY WHICH JUSTIFIES ITS LARGE BUDGET AND NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM BY CITING THE INDIAN MENACE. ANY DIMINUTION IN TENSIONS WITH INDIA MIGHT RISK THE ARMY??S LOCK ON ITS CONTROL OF PAKISTAN??S NATIONAL SECURITY POLICY. THE ARMY CONTINUES TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN ??GOOD? TERRORISTS LIKE JEM AND LET AND ??BAD? TERRORISTS LIKE THE PAKISTANI TALIBAN DESPITE DECADES OF LECTURES FROM AMERICAN LEADERS. THE ARMY HAS LONG DISTRUSTED PRIME MINISTER NAWAZ SHARIF WHO HAS ADVOCATED A DETENTE WITH INDIA SINCE THE 1990S. AN ARMY COUP IN 1999 SENT HIM INTO EXILE IN SAUDI ARABIA FOR A DECADE. HIS WARM EMBRACE OF MODI ON CHRISTMAS DAY IN HIS HOME IN LAHORE UNDOUBTEDLY ANGERED THE GENERALS. MODI??S VISIT WAS THE FIRST BY AN INDIAN PRIME MINISTER IN MORE THAN A DECADE. IT WAS ALSO SHARIF??S BIRTHDAY AND THE BIRTHDAY OF PAKISTAN??S FOUNDER MUHAMMAD JINNAH. MODI??S DECISION TO VISIT AND THE WARM FAMILY GREETING SHARIF EXTENDED SET THE STAGE FOR A PLANNED RESUMPTION OF FORMAL DIPLOMATIC NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES SCHEDULED FOR LATER THIS MONTH. SO FAR NEW DELHI HAS NOT CANCELED THE PLANNED TALKS. MODI??S ADVISERS ARE WELL AWARE OF THE DOUBLE GAME THE PAKISTANI ARMY PLAYS AND THE DIFFERENCES INSIDE THE PAKISTANI ESTABLISHMENT. AFTER FOUR WARS WITH PAKISTAN AND A NUCLEAR ARMS RACE INDIAN EXPERTS UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITY OF THE DYNAMICS INSIDE ISLAMABAD. THE INDIANS HAVE ACCEPTED PRIME MINISTER SHARIF??S PUBLIC CONDEMNATION OF THE ATTACK AND PROMISED TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF JEM??S ROLE TO HIS GOVERNMENT INCLUDING CELLPHONES CAPTURED IN THE ATTACK. WASHINGTON PUT JEM ON THE TERRORIST SANCTIONS LIST YEARS AGO??BUT IT CONTINUES TO CODDLE THE PAKISTANI ARMY. GEN. RAHEEL SHARIF THE ARMY??S BOSS (AND NO RELATION TO THE PRIME MINISTER) GOT A WARM EMBRACE FROM THE PENTAGON LAST FALL??DESPITE THE ISI??S SUPPORT FOR THE AFGHAN TALIBAN??S OFFENSIVE AGAINST THE KABUL GOVERNMENT AND DESPITE THE PAKISTANI MILITARY??S BACKING OF TERROR GROUPS LIKE JEM. ,26947.0

BENNETT WHO MANAGED TO GET WATTS TO STICK AROUND LONGER THAN ANTICIPATED IS CONTEMPLATIVE AND JOVIAL BREAKING INTO A HIGH-PITCHED CHUCKLE AS HE AND WATTS REGALE EACH OTHER WITH THE SOMEWHAT TRAUMATIC STORIES LIKE SUPERMODELS WOULD TREAT UNATTRACTIVE PICTURES OF THEMSELVES IN HIGH SCHOOL. AND NOW THAT THEY??VE SEPARATED FROM THE CAMPAIGN AND BENNETT HAS ACCEPTED A ROLE AS AN UNPAID ADVISOR FOR TRUMP??S CAMP IT??S A NO-HOLDS BARRED WAR AGAINST WILLIAMS WHO TOOK TO FACEBOOK ON FRIDAY TO ADDRESS THEIR ??UNMITIGATED GALL.? ??IF THEY ARE SO WILLING TO THROW CARSON UNDER THE BUS WHAT WILL THEY DO TO THEIR NEXT EMPLOYER?? WILLIAMS WROTE. AS BENNETT AND WATTS SEE IT IT??S WILLIAMS WHO HAS THROWN CARSON UNDER THE BUS. NOW THEY JUST HOPE THAT CARSON WILL WAKE UP LISTEN TO REASON AND STOP TAKING ORDERS FROM THE MAN WHO THEY SAY HAS DRIVEN THE CAMPAIGN ??OFF A CLIFF.? ??BEN CARSON HAS NEVER SAID ARMSTRONG WILLIAMS IS MY BUSINESS MANAGER? BENNETT SAID EMPHASIZING THAT THAT SPECIFIC DESIGNATION IS AN INVENTION FROM WILLIAMS?? OWN IMAGINATIVE BRAIN. ??WHAT BUSINESS IS IT THAT THEY HAVE TOGETHER? THE THING THAT CUTS THE DEEPEST FOR BENNETT AND WATTS IS THAT THEY REALLY LIKE CARSON AND WERE PERSONALLY TOUCHED BY HIS INSPIRING STORY. WATTS STUDIED THE PLAYBOOK OF BARACK OBAMA??S SUCCESSFUL 2008 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN HOPING THAT CARSON COULD CAPITALIZE ON THE SAME GROUNDSWELL OF SUPPORT FROM PEOPLE LOOKING FOR HOPE ONCE AGAIN. IN THE SOFT-SPOKEN FORMER NEUROSURGEON THE TAG TEAM SAW A PERSON WHO COULD BE THE INSURGENT CANDIDATE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY DESPERATELY NEEDED A SIMILAR GAME PLAN THAT HAS WORKED ITS MAGIC FOR TED CRUZ DONALD TRUMP. AND IT WORKED IN THE BRIEF SPELL WHERE CARSON BECAME THE NATION??S FRONTRUNNER AND THE ONLY PERSON TO DATE WHO MANAGED TO OUTPOLL TRUMP NATIONALLY. FOR BENNETT AND WATTS IT ALL SEEMED POSSIBLE TOO BUT FOR ARMSTRONG WILLIAMS WHO ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS BYPASSED THE REST OF THE TEAM APPROVING FISCALLY IRRESPONSIBLE MOVES AND PERMITTING INTERVIEWS FOR CARSON AND HIS TEAM THAT TURNED DISASTROUS. IN JUST ONE OF THESE CASES WILLIAMS OFFERED UP A PERSONAL DRIVER FOR CARSON BEFORE THE CAMPAIGN WAS GRANTED SECRET SERVICE PROTECTION. ACCORDING TO BENNETT HE WOULD DRIVE CARSON AROUND WILLY-NILLY FOR MONTHS UNTIL WILLIAMS DROPPED A $22000 INVOICE FOR HIS SERVICES WITH NO WARNING AND NO PRECEDENT. IN ANOTHER INSTANCE WILLIAMS OUTSOURCED THE PRODUCTION OF A CAMPAIGN SONG TO THE TUNE OF OVER $50000. THE PROBLEM WAS THAT THE CAMPAIGN HAD ALREADY PUT MONEY BEHIND ANOTHER TUNE ALREADY AND WILLIAMS KNEW THAT. ??WHAT THE F-? BENNETT SAID TRAILING OFF TO AVOID SAYING THE WORD. ??I??M NOT PAYING FOR THIS.? ABOVE AND BEYOND HIS FLAGRANT DISINTEREST IN COLLABORATING WITH THE CAMPAIGN INFRASTRUCTURE WILLIAMS WOULD ALLEGEDLY LIE TO CARSON TO CREATE AN ILLUSION THAT ALL INTERNAL RELATIONS WERE SOUND. ??SOMETIMES ARMSTRONG WOULD LIE TO HIM AND SAY THAT HE HAD TALKED TO US AND THAT WE HAD SIGNED OFF? BENNETT SAID. ??THAT WAS NEVER THE CASE. THEN BEN WOULD TRY TO BE THE PEACEMAKER.? ??I THINK HE??S JUST LIVING IN AN ALTERNATIVE UNIVERSE? BENNETT SAID TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY CARSON WOULD STILL COOPERATE WITH WILLIAMS. SUCH WAS THE DISCORDANT NATURE OF A CAMPAIGN WHERE IN MANY INSTANCES REPORTERS WOULD STRUGGLE WITH CONFLICTING STATEMENTS COMING OUT OF TWO DISPARATE CAMPS: BENNETT AND WATTS ON ONE SIDE AND WILLIAMS ON THE OTHER. IN SOME CASES WILLIAMS WOULD BE ON THE PHONE WITH CARSON AND REPORTERS AT THE SAME TIME TRYING TO GET THE STORY STRAIGHT IN REAL TIME. EVEN AS WILLIAMS ATTEMPTED TO FLOAT ABOVE THE CAMPAIGN NEVER DISTINGUISHING HIMSELF AS AN ACTUAL STAFFER AND NEVER ACTUALLY APPEARING AT CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS HE WAS ALWAYS PULLING THE STRINGS. ??YEAH HE WOULD TELL YOU HE HAS NOTHING TO DO IT WHICH IS COMPLETE AND UTTER BULLSHIT? BENNETT SAID. WILLIAMS HAS NEVER MADE A SECRET OF HOW TOUGH HE CAN BE TO HIS COLLEAGUES AND EMPLOYEES - EVEN USING IT AS A DEFENSE IN A 1997 SEXUAL HARASSMENT CASE THAT WAS EVENTUALLY DISMISSED. BOTH BENNETT AND WATTS ACKNOWLEDGED THE CASE ITSELF WAS JUST A SUBSIDIARY CONCERN AS WILLIAMS POSITIONED HIMSELF FOR A ROLE IN CARSON??S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN BUT WAS JUST ONE OF A MULTITUDE OF REASONS WHY WATTS AND BENNETT BEGAN TO LOSE FAITH IN THE WHOLE ENDEAVOR. ??WE ONLY READ IT IN PASSING AND SAID ??OK I GUESS WE??RE GOING TO HAVE TO HANDLE THIS AT SOME POINT IN THE CAMPAIGN?? WATTS SAID BREAKING INTO ONE OF HIS BURLY LAUGHS. THE PLAINTIFF IN THE HARASSMENT CASE WAS STEPHEN GREGORY A YOUNG MAN WHO MET WILLIAMS IN 1994 WHEN HE WAS HIRED AS HIS PERSONAL TRAINER AT A LOCAL YMCA. GREGORY WENT ON TO WORK ALONGSIDE WILLIAMS ON HIS RADIO PROGRAM ??THE RIGHT SIDE? - A SHOW WHICH STILL AIRS TO THIS DAY - AND EVENTUALLY BECAME HIS RADIO PRODUCER. ON APRIL 10 1996 GREGORY FILED HIS COMPLAINT DETAILING ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT OVER A PERIOD OF TWO YEARS AND REQUESTED ??EMOTIONAL DISTRESS DAMAGES IN AN AMOUNT TO BE PROVEN AT TRIAL.? ??I DIDN??T SEXUALLY HARASS HIM BUT I DID HARASS HIM? WILLIAMS SAID DEFENDING HIMSELF IN A DEPOSITION AT THE TIME. ??I ONLY HARASSED HIM TO DO HIS JOB.? THE LIST OF ALLEGED PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL ALTERCATIONS BEGAN WITH WILLIAMS TOUCHING GREGORY??S KNEE WHILE HE WAS DRIVING ACCORDING TO GREGORY??S STATEMENTS TO PSYCHOLOGISTS IN COURT DOCUMENTS OBTAINED BY THE DAILY BEAST. THERE ARE OTHER PURPORTED INSTANCES OF WILLIAMS GRABBING GREGORY??S BUTT AND PENIS IN THE OFFICE DISCUSSIONS OF SEXUAL MATTERS REQUESTS FOR PERSONAL TIME BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM AND SHARED BEDS IN HOTEL ROOMS ON BUSINESS TRIPS. GREGORY CLAIMED THAT HE WAS FIRED FROM HIS POSITION BECAUSE HE REPEATEDLY REJECTED THESE SEXUAL ADVANCES. HE AND HIS ATTORNEY MICKEY WHEATLEY REQUESTED $250000 IN DAMAGES WHICH WILLIAMS CHALKED UP TO AN EXTORTION LETTER CALLING THE ALLEGATIONS BASELESS. WILLIAMS AND HIS ATTORNEY PETER AXELRAD PAINTED GREGORY AS AN INEPT EMPLOYEE WHO WAS FIRED FOR DOING A BAD JOB. ??TO SUE PEOPLE WHO ARE WELL KNOWN WHO HAS A DEGREE OF MONEY. YOU MAKE FALSE ALLEGATIONS AND YOU HOPE TO LIVE A LIFE WITHOUT EVER WORKING FOR - EARNING AN INCOME? WILLIAMS SAID IN A DEPOSITION. DURING WILLIAMS?? DEPOSITIONS THE ARGUMENT WITH WHEATLEY DEVOLVED INTO A SERIES OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE RADIO HOST??S SEXUALITY. WILLIAMS A PROMINENT MEDIA FIGURE IN CONSERVATIVE CIRCLES WHO GAINED NOTORIETY FOR DEFENDING CLARENCE THOMAS PATENTLY DENIED ANY SUGGESTION THAT HE WAS HOMOSEXUAL AND REFERRED TO IT AS A SIN. ??I CAN??T SPEAK FOR OTHER HETEROSEXUALS BUT I CAN ONLY SPEAK FOR MYSELF? WILLIAMS SAID WHEN WHEATLEY ASKED IF IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE HARASSED GREGORY BECAUSE HE IS HETEROSEXUAL. ??IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT I COULD HAVE HARASSED THE MAN WHO WORKED FOR ME. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE.? WHILE IT REMAINED UNCLEAR WHAT IF ANYTHING EXACTLY HAPPENED BETWEEN GREGORY AND WILLIAMS THIS WASN??T THE FIRST TIME THAT AN EMPLOYEE HAD LEVELED THESE SORTS OF ALLEGATIONS IN THE PAST. ANOTHER EMPLOYEE EBON ROBINSON SAID THAT WILLIAMS SEXUALLY HARASSED HIM AS WELL BUT LATER RECANTED THE STATEMENT. GREGORY??S COUNSEL ALSO ALLEGED AT THE TIME THAT THEY HAD SPOKEN TO A FORMER MASSEUR WHO MADE SIMILAR ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE RADIO HOST. MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS TO REACH WHEATLEY AND GREGORY WERE UNSUCCESSFUL. THE GREGORY CASE CAME TO HALT ON JANUARY 19 1999 WHEN BOTH PARTIES SUDDENLY AGREED TO DISMISS THE MATTER WITH PREJUDICE IN D.C. SUPERIOR COURT. WHILE THE ATTORNEYS WERE PREPARING FOR WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN A NASTY TRIAL IN APRIL GREGORY AND WILLIAMS PRIVATELY AGREED TO WALK AWAY FROM THE CASE. AT THE TIME WILLIAMS CLAIMED THAT NO MONEY CHANGED HANDS BUT GREGORY DIDN??T COMMENT AS TO WHETHER THERE WERE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR HIM TO DISMISS THE CHARGES. \I AM NOT GOING TO COMMENT ON THAT\"" HE SAID. \""I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE RESOLUTION.\"" WHEN THE DAILY BEAST SPOKE WITH WILLIAMS?? ATTORNEY AT THE TIME PETER AXELRAD A CIVIL TRIAL LITIGATION ATTORNEY IN MARYLAND HE CLAIMED HE HAD NO IDEA HOW THE CASE ENDED. ??IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT THIS MATTER WAS SETTLED? AXELRAD SAID. ??I CAN??T TELL YOU.? BUT TO HIS RECOLLECTION AXELRAD THOUGHT THE SUIT WAS A WASTE OF TIME. ??WE DIDN??T BELIEVE IN THE CASE? HE SAID. ??I DIDN??T BELIEVE THAT THE PLAINTIFF HAD ANY MERIT.? WATTS AND BENNETT SAID WILLIAMS HAS NEVER HARASSED ANYONE ON THE CAMPAIGN EXCEPT THEY JOKED FOR THEM. ??MY HISTORY HAS ALWAYS BEEN [THAT] INNOCENT PEOPLE DON??T OFTEN WRITE CHECKS? BENNETT ADDED. BUT THE ONLY THING BENNETT IS OUTRIGHT WILLING TO ACCUSE WILLIAMS OF IS BEING A BULLY - ONE WHO PUSHES CARSON AROUND UNTIL HE GETS HIS WAY. AS TO WHICH WAY CARSON IS GOING AS THE CAMPAIGN CONTINUES TO NOSEDIVE BENNETT SAYS THERE??S ONLY ONE SENSIBLE PATH. ??I??M SURE HE??D NEVER DO IT BUT THE MOST INFLUENCE HE??D EVER HAVE RIGHT NOW IS [WITH] TRUMP? BENNETT WHO THINKS TRUMP WILL GET THE NOMINATION SAID. ??HE COULD ENDORSE TRUMP AND HELP HIM WIN IOWA.? HE THINKS THIS??LL NEVER HAPPEN THOUGH AND THAT CARSON WILL RIDE THE CAMPAIGN OUT UNTIL THE WHEELS FALL OFF. THAT IS MAYBE UNLESS ARMSTRONG WILLIAMS SAYS OTHERWISE. KATERINA PAPPAS CONTRIBUTED REPORTING """,24940.0

WE GO TO RENEW THE FIGHT. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE SECOND WAVE OF THE AMERICAN HUMAN RIGHTS MOVEMENT TOOK ROOT HERE ON THE VERY GROUND WHERE DR. KING ONCE TROD. HE STOOD WITH PEOPLE LIKE FORMER AMBASSADOR ANDREW YOUNG C.T. VIVIAN AND THE REVEREND JAMES ORANGE. TOGETHER THEY PAVED THE WAY FOR A NEW GENERATION OF FREEDOM FIGHTERS INCLUDING A LITTLE BROWN GIRL LIKE ME??BORN IN THE HEAT OF 1968. IT WAS ORANGE AN EARLY MENTOR WHO REMINDED ME NEARLY 20 YEARS AGO OF MY OWN OBLIGATION TO SOCIETY.

KING. THEY WILL TELL YOU THAT WE??VE COME A MIGHTY LONG WAY SINCE THE PASSAGE OF MULTIPLE CIVIL RIGHTS ACTS??AND IN LARGE MEASURE THEY ARE RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

THE TRUTH IS THE CONSTITUTION THAT WE HOLD SO DEAR WROTE A CHECK LARGER THAN THE VERY SOULS OF THE MEN WHO DRAFTED IT.?Ÿ CERTAINLY THE PROGRESS WE HAVE GAINED OVER THE NEAR HALF-CENTURY IS SIGNIFICANT. HOWEVER PROGRESS IS MEASURED NOT IN THE HEIGHT OF THE MOUNTAINS CLIMBED. IT IS MEASURED IN THE DEPTH OF THE VALLEYS WHERE THE FORSAKEN RESIDE. IT IS MEASURED THE FINAL HEARTBEATS OF A TWELVE-YEAR-OLD BOY SHOT DEAD OVER A TOY GUN IN A SNOWY PARK IN CLEVELAND OHIO. IT IS MEASURED BY THE LABORED BREATHS OF A MAN CHOKED TO DEATH ON A NEW YORK STREET FOR DARING TO PROTEST HIS UNLAWFUL ARREST. IT IS MEASURED IN A PROSECUTOR AND A GRAND JURY??S INABILITY TO SEE THE IMMORALITY OF SUCH HORRORS. IT IS MEASURED IN THE FRUSTRATION OF AN EIGHTY-SOME-ODD YEAR OLD BLACK WOMAN WHO CANNOT PRODUCE A BIRTH CERTIFICATE TO JOIN THE VOTING ROLLS. AND IN THE EYES OF A CHILD OF AN UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT SLEEPING ON THE BARE FLOOR OF A DETENTION CENTER WAITING TO BE SENT TO A PLACE THEY??VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. IT IS MEASURED IN THE SOULS OF NINE PRAYING SAINTS IN THE BASEMENT OF A CHARLESTON CHURCH SLAUGHTERED BY A WHITE SUPREMACIST. IT IS MEASURED IN THE PAYCHECK OF A WOMAN WHO RECEIVES HALF THE PAY FOR TWICE THE WORK. IT IS MEASURED IN CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS DERIVATIVES AND PREDATORY LENDING PRACTICES THAT STRIP HARDWORKING PEOPLE OF THEIR HOMES AND LEAVE THEM SADDLED IN DEBT BECAUSE THEY ?? UNLIKE THE BANKS??AREN??T TOO BIG TO FAIL. IT IS MEASURED IN THE WATER SPOILED WITH TOXINS AND LEAD PUMPING THROUGH FLINT MICHIGAN. WHEN DR. KING SPOKE SO ELOQUENTLY AND WITH SUCH GREAT MORAL CLARITY ABOUT THE ARC OF JUSTICE ABOUT POVERTY ABOUT LIVING OUT OUR COLLECTIVE HIGHER CONSCIENCE I BELIEVE IN MY HEART THAT THIS IS WHAT HE MEANT. HOWEVER AS WE CELEBRATE HIS BIRTH I DO SO NOT ONLY WITH A HEART OF SADNESS FOR OUR CURRENT CONDITION BUT ALSO IN GLADNESS THAT ONLY HOPE CAN BRING. I JOY IN A MIRACLE THAT HAS YET TO UNFOLD. WHILE THERE REMAINS A SINGLE SOUL TRAPPED IN THE PRISON OF OPPRESSION STUCK IN THE VALLEY NONE OF US CAN BE FREE.

1116,10247959.0,2016-01-25T05:01:00+00:00,IS BLOOMBERG BETTING HILLARY GETS INDICTED?,THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM SAYS THAT MIKE BLOOMBERG WHOSE PRESIDENTIAL DREAMS WERE REVEALED SATURDAY BY THE NEW YORK TIMES WILL IN ALL LIKELIHOOD NOT RUN AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON. THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM IS PROBABLY RIGHT IN THIS CASE. IT??S HARD TO IMAGINE THAT AGAINST CLINTON BLOOMBERG WOULD BE ANYTHING BUT A NADERESQUE SPOILER WHICH HE WOULD KNOW AND NOT WANT TO BE AGAINST BERNIE SANDERS ON ONE SIDE AND CRUMP ON THE OTHER (EITHER TED CRUZ OR DONALD TRUMP) HOWEVER I THINK BLOOMBERG BECOMES A CANDIDATE??AND A REAL PLAYER. UNFORTUNATELY FOR BLOOMBERG THE CHANCES OF SANDERS WINNING THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION ARE QUITE SLIM AS HE SURELY KNOWS. SO THE RUBBER-HITTING-ROAD QUESTION IS: IS THERE ANY CHANCE HE??D RUN AGAINST CLINTON? I MEAN IF NOTHING ELSE THIS IS PRESUMABLY HIS LAST SHOT AT GLORY AS HE??S A FEW WEEKS SHY OF 74 (WHAT??S WITH ALL THESE SEPTUAGENARIANS ANYWAY?). THERE WAS A HINT IN THAT TIMES ARTICLE THAT SUGGESTED HE MIGHT CONSIDER DOING THAT??THAT AT A DINNER PARTY AT THE HOME OF A PROMINENT CLINTON BACKER LAST FALL BLOOMBERG OFFERED A ??PIQUANT ASSESSMENT? (THOSE TIMES EUPHEMISMS!) OF CLINTON??S WEAKNESSES BUILT AROUND ??QUESTIONS ABOUT HER HONESTY? AND THE EMAIL MESS. I CAN BACK THIS UP. ON SATURDAY I SPOKE WITH A LONGTIME NEW YORKER I KNOW WHO HEARD BLOOMBERG INVEIGH SIMILARLY LAST YEAR AT ANOTHER SUCH EVENT AS BLOOMBERG DELIVERED A BLISTERING CRITIQUE OF THE EMAIL CONTROVERSY AND EVEN SUGGESTED??WELL PIQUANTLY!??THAT CLINTON DESERVED TO BE IN VERY SERIOUS LEGAL TROUBLE. THIS PERSON WAS ??SHOCKED BY HOW LITTLE HE SEEMED TO THINK OF HER.? A SOURCE IN BLOOMBERG WORLD SAYS THIS IS NONSENSE THIS PERSON CLAIMS TO HAVE HEARD THE EX-MAYOR LIMN CLINTON IN ADULATORY TONES NUMEROUS TIMES SAYING IN THIS PERSON??S WORDS THAT SHE WAS PRACTICALLY ALONE AMONG THE CANDIDATES IN BEING ABLE ??TO TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS???SIMPLY TO RUN THE GOVERNMENT AND COUNTRY RESPONSIBLY AND PRUDENTLY. FROM THE TECHNOCRATIC BLOOMBERG PRAISE DOESN??T COME HIGHER. BOTH THESE THINGS CAN BE TRUE OF COURSE. LET??S ASSUME THAT BLOOMBERG WAS AGHAST AT THE EMAIL SITUATION LAST YEAR BUT THAT IT??S FADED AND HE??S NOW DECIDED HE??D BE FINE WITH A CLINTON PRESIDENCY EVEN AS HE EXPLORES A BID OF HIS OWN. OKAY. BUT EVEN THIS BRINGS US TO ANOTHER THOUGHT??THAT MAYBE BLOOMBERG THINKS THERE??S SOME CHANCE CLINTON MIGHT BE INDICTED SOMETIME SOON. IF YOU WERE SHOCKED TO READ THAT SENTENCE YOU??RE CLEARLY NOT READING ENOUGH CONSERVATIVE WEB SITES. LET ME SAY UP FRONT HERE THAT WHILE I HAVE NO IDEA OF THE STATUS OF THE ONGOING FBI INVESTIGATION INTO THE EMAIL BUSINESS I WOULD BE REALLY SURPRISED TO SEE THIS HAPPEN. RIGHTIES HAVE BEEN PREDICTING HER IMMINENT INDICTMENT EVER SINCE BILL SAFIRE??S IGNOMINIOUS 1996 COLUMN BUT AS FAR AS IS KNOWN PUBLICLY CLINTON IS NOT UNDER INVESTIGATION. IT WAS LAST SUMMER WHEN THE FBI STARTED LOOKING INTO THE MATTER AND OFFICIALS ANNOUNCED THEN THAT CLINTON WASN??T A TARGET. BUT THAT WAS MONTHS AGO SO WHO KNOWS REALLY? THIS CHARLES MCCULLOUGH THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY INSPECTOR GENERAL WHO KEEPS RETROACTIVELY STAMPING ??CLASSIFIED? ON EMAILS CLINTON READ OR WROTE WHEN SHE WAS SECRETARY AND WHO ORIGINALLY NOTIFIED THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH LAST JULY THAT CLASSIFIED INFORMATION MIGHT EXIST ON CLINTON??S SERVER SURE SEEMS TO BE AN AGGRESSIVE SORT. I THINK IT??S A FARFETCHED SCENARIO MYSELF. AN EX-PROSECUTOR FRIEND TELLS ME THAT A CRIME WOULD REQUIRE CRIMINAL INTENT. THEN THERE??S THE QUESTION OF THE TIMING. SOMEBODY??S GOING TO BRING SERIOUS CHARGES AGAINST ONE OF THE TWO MAJOR PARTIES?? LEADING PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL IN AN ELECTION YEAR? CONSERVATIVES WHOSE CAROTID VEINS ARE POPPING AFTER READING THAT SENTENCE WOULD DO WELL TO REMEMBER A TIME WHEN THEY EXCORIATED A PROSECUTOR WHO BROUGHT SUSPICIOUSLY TIMED INDICTMENTS OF REPUBLICANS. GOOGLE LAWRENCE WALSH. BUT MOSTLY IT SEEMS FARFETCHED TO ME BECAUSE I JUST CONSIDER IT PRETTY UNLIKELY THAT ANY SECRETARY OF STATE ANY AMERICAN IN THAT POSITION WOULD KNOWINGLY COMPROMISE U.S. INTELLIGENCE-GATHERING EFFORTS. IF YOU TALK TO PLUGGED-IN LIBERALS THEY SAY FORGET IT RIDICULOUS. IF YOU TALK TO PLUGGED-IN CONSERVATIVES THEY WELL THEY AT LEAST HOPE IT??S GOING TO HAPPEN THINK IT CLEARLY OUGHT TO HAPPEN AND MAYBE THIS WEEK I.E. BEFORE DEMOCRATS START CASTING VOTES. IF NOTHING ELSE A NON-INDICTMENT GIVES THEM ALL A CHANCE TO CATERWAUL FOR ANOTHER FEW MONTHS (OR YEARS) ABOUT HOW THE CLINTONS KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH THINGS AND GO RAISE MONEY OFF THAT. AND WHAT IF THESE CONSERVATIVES HAPPEN TO BE RIGHT? WELL WHEN I??VE DISCUSSED THIS WITH LIBERALS MOST PEOPLE THINK JOE BIDEN IS THE AUTOMATIC PLAN B. JOHN KERRY GETS A FEW MENTIONS ON THE GROUNDS THAT HE TRIED IT ONCE BEFORE BUT THAT STRIKES ME AS A MINUS NOT A PLUS. IN ANY CASE DEMOCRATS I??VE DISCUSSED THIS WITH ALL ASSUME THEY RALLY BEHIND A NEW ESTABLISHMENT-TYPE CANDIDATE RATHER THAN THROWING IN THEIR EGGS WITH BERNIE. OR MAYBE THEY COULD RALLY TO A BLOOMBERG BID SINCE MANY MANY DEMOCRATS REPRESENT DISTRICTS WHERE A SANDERS ENDORSEMENT COULD HURT THEM. AND DON??T FORGET THE ABOVE SCENARIO SEEMS TO ASSUME THAT CLINTON UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD JUST STOP IN HER TRACKS. NOT SURE WE CAN ASSUME THAT. I HOPE AND BELIEVE ALL THIS WILL REMAIN HYPOTHETICAL. I JUST BET IT??S RATTLING AROUND IN BLOOMBERG??S CAGE SOMEWHERE. ,60026.0

AFTER THE NOV. 20 2015 ATTACK IN BAMAKO THE MALIAN CAPITAL WHICH AL QAEDA IN THE ISLAMIC MAGHREB (AQIM) AND ITS OFFSHOOT AL-MOURABITOUN SAID THEY CARRIED OUT AN IMAGE ON MALI STATE TELEVISION SHOWED TWO YOUNG MEN ALLEGED TO BE THE \AUTHORS\"" OF THE INCIDENT THAT KILLED AT LEAST 22 PEOPLE MOSTLY FOREIGN NATIONALS. THEN LAST FRIDAY THE SAME AQIM GROUP UNLEASHED ANOTHER BATCH OF YOUNG MILITANTS ON BURKINA FASO??S POPULAR SPLENDID HOTEL AND A NEIGHBORING CAFE IN THE CAPITAL OUAGADOUGOU KILLING 30 PEOPLE INCLUDING EIGHT BURKINABES SIX CANADIANS THREE UKRAINIANS THREE FRENCH AND AN AMERICAN. ON MONDAY THE JIHADISTS PUBLISHED PHOTOGRAPHS OF THREE ADOLESCENT MEN SAID TO HAVE CARRIED OUT THE OUAGADOUGOU ATTACKS. THEY WORE MILITARY UNIFORMS HELD KALASHNIKOVS AND WERE GIVEN THE NAMES BATTAR AL-ANSARI ABU MUHAMMAD AL-BUQALI AL-ANSARI AND AHMED AL-FULANI AL-ANSARI. THE JIHADISTS RELEASED NO FURTHER DETAILS BUT AL-ANSARI IS A NOM DE GUERRE THAT USUALLY DESIGNATES SOMEBODY FROM NORTHERN MALI. THE NAME MIGHT EQUALLY HAVE BEEN USED TO INDICATE WHERE THE ??BRIGADE? IS BASED OR ORIGINATES FROM. TWO OF THE ADOLESCENT MEN IN THE PHOTOGRAPHS WERE BLACK AND ANOTHER WAS FAIRSKINNED SUGGESTING HE MIGHT BE FROM AN ARAB OR TUAREG GROUP. THE VARIOUS ISLAMIST FACTIONS IN MALI??WHERE THESE YOUNG JIHADISTS CERTAINLY HAVE ROOTS??ARE NOTORIOUS FOR RECRUITING ADOLESCENT SOLDIERS INTO THEIR RANKS AND FORCING THEM TO COMMIT ACTS OF VIOLENCE . ONE SUCH YOUNG MILITANT WAS SEYDOU WHO IS NOW 15 YEARS OLD. THE TEENAGER WAS WEEKS SHY OF HIS 14TH BIRTHDAY WHEN HE JOINED AL-QAEDA-BACKED MILITANTS FIGHTING TO TAKE CONTROL OF NORTHERN MALI. HE HAD BEEN HANDED TO THE JIHADISTS BY HIS PARENTS. MEN WORKING FOR THE MILITANTS TOLD SEYDOU??S MOTHER AND FATHER THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS GIVING OUT MONIES TO FAMILIES WHO AGREED TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO QURAN SCHOOLS TO RECEIVE AN ISLAMIC EDUCATION. THE MILITANTS PAID MONEY TO SEYDOU??S PARENTS WHICH THE BOY SAID WAS IN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CFA FRANCS (EQUIVALENT TO A FEW HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS). THUS BY HIS ACCOUNT THEY WERE DECEIVED INTO HANDING THEIR ONLY SON TO A TERRORIST GROUP. IN FACT HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF MALIAN CHILDREN HAVE BEEN SOLD TO ARMED GROUPS BY FAMILY MEMBERS OR SCHOOL OFFICIALS IN EXCHANGE FOR MONEY. IN OTHER CASES THE CHILDREN THEMSELVES MAY HAVE BEEN LURED IN BY MONEY AND THE APPEAL OF ??FIGHTING FOR GOD? ESPECIALLY AFTER INDOCTRINATION IN RELIGIOUS SCHOOLS. GIRLS OFTEN ARE BOUGHT OR ABDUCTED TO BECOME THE WIVES OF COMBATANTS. IN 2013 THE UNITED NATIONS ADDED MALI TO ITS CHILD SOLDIERS LIST OF SHAME. SINCE MORE THAN 50 PERCENT OF MALI'S 15.8 MILLION PEOPLE ARE CHILDREN THERE IS A LARGE POOL FROM WHICH TO RECRUIT. THE COUNTRY??S JIHADISTS ALSO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A COMMON TRADITION IN WEST AFRICA WHERE PARENTS AND GUARDIANS MOSTLY IN RURAL MUSLIM AREAS SEND THEIR CHILDREN AWAY TO THE FAR CITIES FOR AN ISLAMIC EDUCATION PARTICULARLY IF THEY CAN??T AFFORD TO PAY FOR SCHOOL FEES OR PROVIDE MEALS. SEYDOU USED TO CARRY AN AK-47 DURING HIS TIME WITH THE MILITANTS WHO HAVE TERRORIZED NORTHERN MALI SINCE 2012. NOW HE SLEEPS ROUGH LIVING IN SENEGAL AS ONE OF THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN WHO PLY THE STREETS OF THE COUNTRY BEGGING FOR FOOD AND MONEY. I MET SEYDOU WHEN HE WAS WALKING WITH A BOWL IN HIS HAND IN SEARCH OF ALMS ALONG WITH A COUPLE OF TEENAGE BOYS IN ONE OF DAKAR??S BUSTLING NEIGHBORHOODS. I WAS TOLD BY MY CONTACT IN DAKAR THAT I WOULD FIND CHILDREN TRAFFICKED FROM NEIGHBORING MALI GUINEA AND GUINEA-BISSAU AT THE CITY??S ??DOWNTOWN? AND THERE INDEED I MET DOZENS OF CHILDREN AT DIFFERENT LOCATIONS AND SPENT HOURS SPEAKING TO THOSE WHO HAD A STORY TO TELL. SEYDOU IS ONE OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF TALIB??S??FROM ARABIC WORD FOR PUPIL (A LOCAL VARIANT OF THE WORD TALIBAN USED IN AFGHANISTAN). THEY ARE SENT UP TO HUNDREDS OF KILOMETERS AWAY FROM HOME TO GAIN RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION AT THE?ŸCLASSROOMS OR?Ÿ\""DAARAS\""?Ÿ(MADRASSAS) WHERE?ŸA QURANIC TEACHER OR \""MARABOUT\"" TRADITIONALLY INSTRUCTS THE CHILDREN ON HOW TO READ?ŸTHE QURAN. SEYDOU LED ME TO A QUIET SPACE FAR ENOUGH AWAY THAT OTHER PASSERSBY WON??T HEAR THE STORIES HE WOULD TELL. I WAS ABLE TO GET AN INTERPRETER AS THE BOY SPOKE IN THE LOCAL WOLOF LANGUAGE WHICH HE HAD LEARNED ON THE STREET. WHEN HE BEGAN TO SPEAK I COULD SENSE THE FEAR IN HIM. SEYDOU SAID HE HAD JUST RETURNED FROM PLAYING FOOTBALL WITH HIS FRIENDS IN MALI WHEN HE SAW HIS PARENTS SITTING OUTSIDE THEIR FAMILY HOUSE WITH TWO STRANGE MEN. \""MY FATHER DIDN??T EVEN LET ME ENTER THE HOUSE WHEN HE ASKED ME TO FOLLOW THE MEN THAT WILL TAKE ME TO MY NEW QURANIC TEACHER\"" HE SAID. ??I DIDN??T ARGUE. IT WAS MY DREAM TO LEARN THE QURAN SO I HURRIED TO FOLLOW HIM.? IN ADDITION TO THE MONEY HIS PARENTS GOT SEYDOU WAS TOLD HE COULD EARN 15000 FRANCS (ABOUT $30) A DAY FOR HIMSELF AND 100000 FRANCS ($200) A MONTH FOR HIS FAMILY. IN A REGION STRICKEN BY POVERTY THAT WAS A MASSIVE SUM ESPECIALLY FOR A BOY HIS AGE. BUT THE STORY CHANGED ONCE HE WAS TAKEN FROM HIS HOME. SEYDOU AND OTHER RECRUITS WERE TAKEN TO A TWO-WEEK-LONG TRAINING SESSION AT A CAMP IN MALI'S VAST DESERT WHERE THEY LEARNED THE RUDIMENTS OF SHOOTING. THE JIHADISTS GAVE SEYDOU A NEW NAME. ??ABU BAKR.? ??THEY SAID WE HAD TO LEARN HOW TO PROTECT OURSELVES AND OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS BEFORE LEARNING ANYTHING ELSE? HE RECALLED. ??WE DIDN??T HAVE A CHOICE. ONCE MONEY HAS BEEN PAID ON YOUR HEAD YOU HAVE NO VOICE.? ACROSS NORTHERN MALI JIHADISTS HAVE BOUGHT OVER 1000 CHILDREN FROM RURAL COMMUNITIES DEVASTATED BY POVERTY AND HUNGER. ALTHOUGH THE CONFLICT IN THE COUNTRY BEGAN IN EARLY 2012 IT WAS NOT UNTIL 2013 THAT THE ACT OF RECRUITING CHILD SOLDIERS BY MILITANTS BECAME PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE. SEYDOU WHO JOINED UP WITH MALI'S NORTHERN JIHADISTS IN 2014 SAID SOME FIGHTERS WERE ALSO RECRUITED FROM THE SOUTH OF THE COUNTRY WHERE MILITANT GROUPS BECAME ACTIVE LAST YEAR AND FROM NEIGHBORING BURKINA FASO AND NIGER. ALL THROUGH HIS TIME AS A MILITANT SEYDOU SAID HE ONLY PLAYED SUPPORTING ROLES BEHIND THE FRONT LINE AND DENIES KILLING ANYONE OR COMMITTING ANY RIGHTS ABUSES BUT HE ADMITS RECEIVING MONEY OCCASIONALLY FROM THE JIHADISTS ESPECIALLY AFTER RUNNING ERRANDS. MALI??S JIHADISTS PARTICULARLY THE GROUP KNOWN AS MUJAO FUND THEMSELVES THROUGH KIDNAPPINGS AND LUCRATIVE TRAFFICKING ACTIVITIES AND CAN AFFORD TO PAY WELL. SEYDOU SAID THE MILITANTS GAVE CHILDREN MILITARY TRAINING AND RELIGIOUS INDOCTRINATION AND THAT HIS INSTRUCTORS WERE ARABS BUT HE DIDN??T KNOW UNDER WHICH NAME THE GROUP OPERATED. CHILD SOLDIERS ARE BEING USED BY ALL THE ARMED GROUPS OPERATING IN MALI??S NORTHERN REGION BUT THE ISLAMIST GROUPS ANSAR DINE AQIM AND NOW AL-MOURABITOUN HAVE BEEN AMONG THE MOST PROMINENT RECRUITERS. ??THEY SHOWED US DIFFERENT TYPES OF WEAPONS AND HOW TO USE THEM IN CASE OF ATTACK? HE SAID. ??OUR INSTRUCTORS TOLD US THAT WHEN WE SHOOT AT THE ENEMY IT WASN??T US DOING SO BUT OUR CREATOR.? MANY OF SEYDOU??S CHILDHOOD FRIENDS HAVE LEFT THEIR HOMES AND ARE NOW WORKING FOR MALI??S MILITANTS IN THE NORTH OF THE COUNTRY. A GREATER NUMBER ARE MOTIVATED BY MONEY BUT SEYDOU SAID THEY ARE A FEW WHO ARE NOT MOVED BY THE BONUSES RATHER ??THEY WANT TO WORK FOR GOD?. ??OUR INSTRUCTORS KEPT TELLING US THAT DEATH IS SWEETER WHEN IT IS FOR GOD? HE SAID. ??BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY OFTEN SAID MANY CHILDREN WERE JUST WAITING FOR THE JIHAD.? TRAINED CHILDREN ARE USED TO STAFF CHECKPOINTS CONDUCT FOOT PATROLS GUARD PRISONERS PREPARE FOOD FOR SENIOR MILITANTS AND IMPLEMENT THE PUNISHMENT PRESCRIBED BY SHARIA LAW. WHEN SEYDOU WAS ASKED TO ATTACK THE TIMBUKTU JAIL WHICH WOULD HAVE SEEN HIM EARN ADDITIONAL CASH HE DECLINED AND INSTEAD FOUND A WAY TO ESCAPE WHILE ON AN ATTACK MISSION WITH MEMBERS OF THE GROUP IN TIMBUKTU. ??I DIDN??T WANT TO BE A FIGHTER I WANTED TO GET AN ISLAMIC EDUCATION? HE SAID. ??I RAN AWAY BECAUSE I DIDN??T HAVE THE HEART TO KILL OR PUNISH ANYONE.? SEYDOU WAS SCARED OF RETURNING TO HIS PARENTS AS HE FEARED THE MILITANTS WOULD TRACE HIM TO HIS HOME. INSTEAD HE DECIDED SEARCH FOR A MARABOUT WHO HE WILL WORK FOR WHILE ALSO RECEIVING QURAN LESSONS. THE BOY WALKED THROUGH THE WILDERNESS FOR HOURS BEFORE ARRIVING AT TIMBUKTU??S MAIN TOWN AND MEETING A MARABOUT WHO PUSHED HIM TO ANOTHER QURAN TEACHER IN THE SOUTH IN WHAT WAS THE BEGINNING OF HIS LONG JOURNEY TO HIS CURRENT ABODE. SEYDOU HAD NO IDEA HE HAD BECOME A VICTIM OF MALI??S THRIVING CHILD TRAFFICKING TRADE. EVEN IF HE KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON THE PROSPECT OF REALIZING HIS LONG-HELD DREAM OF GETTING A QURANIC EDUCATION WAS FAR MORE APPEALING TO HIM THAN ENDING UP IN A MILITANT??S CAMP. FROM MALI HE WAS TAKEN TO BAFATA IN GUINEA-BISSAU AND THEN FARTHER EAST IN THE COUNTRY TO GABU WHERE HE WORKED ON A COTTON FIELD FOR A BRIEF PERIOD BEFORE CROSSING THE BORDER INTO SENEGAL. ON GETTING TO SENEGAL HE WAS PASSED TO ANOTHER MARABOUT IN THE SOUTHWESTERN CITY OF ZIGUINCHOR AND LATER MOVED TO ANOTHER MARABOUT IN DAKAR WHERE HE LEARNED THE QURAN AND THE LOCAL VERNACULAR WOLOF. A 2015 TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS REPORT PUBLISHED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE INDICATES THAT MALIAN CHILDREN ARE TRANSPORTED TO SENEGAL AND GUINEA FOR FORCED LABOR IN GOLD MINES AND TO COTE D??IVOIRE FOR FORCED LABOR ON COTTON AND COCOA FARMS. IN SENEGAL FOR INSTANCE THERE IS A THRIVING CULTURE OF STREET BEGGING AND FORCED LABOR AND THE COUNTRY??S POROUS BORDERS MAKES IT RELATIVELY EASY FOR CHILDREN TO BE TRAFFICKED INTO THE COUNTRY. ANOTHER STATE DEPARTMENT REPORT ON TRAFFICKING REVEALED THAT SENEGAL IS A SOURCE TRANSIT AND DESTINATION COUNTRY FOR CHILDREN AND WOMEN WHO ARE SUBJECTED TO FORCED LABOR AND SEX TRAFFICKING. NOT LONG AGO THE GOVERNMENT DISCOVERED THAT THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN WHO DO NOT SPEAK WOLOF WERE BEING SMUGGLED INTO SENEGAL FROM NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES BY PEOPLE IMPERSONATING MARABOUTS AND USING THE KIDS TO BEG FOR THEIR PERSONAL GAIN. THE GOVERNMENT THEN ANNOUNCED THE REPATRIATION OF ALL NON-SENEGALESE TALIB??S AND BANNED CHILD BEGGING ON THE STREETS AND ALL DAARAS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. BUT CONFLICTS AT THE TIME IN NEIGHBORING MALI AND GUINEA BISSAU AND PRESSURE FROM THE ISLAMIC COMMUNITY FORCED PRESIDENT MACKY SALL TO RESCIND THE EXPULSION ORDER. NOW THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN LIKE SEYDOU ARE MADE TO FACE THE PROSPECT OF LIVES AS BEGGARS OR AS MODERN DAY SLAVES. ?Ÿ ??EVEN THOUGH I SURVIVE THROUGH BEGGING I HAVE FOUND PEACE IN DAKAR? SEYDOU SAID. ??AT LEAST HERE I WOULDN??T HAVE TO KILL ANYONE.? """,2531.0

IN ANOTHER PICTURE HE IS IN A GREEN MESH DRESS AND IN ANOTHER AN OFF-THE-SHOULDER SKIN-TIGHT FROCK WITH A CUTOUT OVER AN IMPRESSIVE PECTORAL. IN A THIRD HE IS WEARING A BLUE T-SHIRT BLUR BRIEFS AND YELLOW ANKLE BOOTS. HE POSES FULL FRONTAL WITH MODESTY CLEVERLY PROTECTED IN ANOTHER WESTWOOD SHOT IN A BLACK EVENING COAT AND BLACK BOOTS AND ANOTHER PICTURE HAS HIM IN A KIND OF WHITE JUMPSUIT MEETS REGENCY DANDY THAT RECALLS NEW ROMANTICISM AT ITS MOST GENDER-BLURRY. THE 35-YEAR-OLD KELLER??A 6-FOOT 200-POUND HANDSOME DRINK OF WATER WITH BEARD BIG ARMS HAIRY CHEST AND FRIENDLY SMILE??MIGHT NOT APPEAR TO BE THE FIRST CHOICE FOR A MALE MODEL FOR WOMENSWEAR: HE IS FAR FROM WAIF-LIKE AND ANDROGYNOUS. HE IS??AS HIS FANS KNOW HIM THROUGH HIS VIDEOS FOR DISTRIBUTORS INCLUDING SEAN CODY RANDY BLUE COCKYBOYS AND OTHERS??RUGGED BEARDED AND MUSCULAR. THE SHOOT WAS A BREAK FROM KELLER??S COLBY DOES AMERICA PROJECT IN WHICH HE AIMS TO HAVE SEX ON CAMERA WITH SOMEONE IN EVERY STATE (HE IS CURRENTLY UP TO 49). THE WESTWOOD SHOOT WAS HIS FIRST HIGH-PROFILE NON-PORN GIG. WHEN WE MET AT THE DAILY BEAST OFFICES??HE WITH HIS HUSBAND AND PUBLICIST THE FABULOUSLY NAMED KARL MARKS??KELLER SAID THE FASHION SHOOT MAY HAVE DERIVED FROM A PICTURE OF HIM IN VINTAGE WESTWOOD TROUSERS THAT HIS FRIEND THE DESIGNER BERNHARD WILLHELM SENT TO ANDREAS KRONTHALER WESTWOOD??S HUSBAND. KELLER SAID WESTWOOD ALSO COULD HAVE HEARD OF HIM THROUGH AN AUCTION BOTH HAD PARTICIPATED IN. HE ENDED UP IN VENICE FOR THE FASHION SHOOT JUST HOURS AFTER FINISHING FILMING ANOTHER NON-PORN PROJECT THIS TIME A COMEDY FOR HBO. ??IT WAS AN AMAZING CRAZY EXPERIENCE? HE SAID OF FLYING TO ITALY ALTHOUGH ONE PAIR OF BLACK PERFORATED LEATHER HIGH-HEELED BOOTS DIDN??T FIT HIS SIZE 14 FEET UNTIL A BRIGHT ASSISTANT HAD THE IDEA TO STRETCH THEM BY DIPPING THEM INTO THE WATER OF A VENETIAN CANAL. WHEN KELLER ARRIVED HE FOUND WESTWOOD TAKING A CATNAP UNDER A TABLE. A HUGE FAN OF HERS??BOTH FOR THE HISTORICAL REFERENCES SHE USES IN HER DESIGNS AND FOR THE PUNK SENSIBILITY THAT IS HER MOST NOTORIOUS FOUNDATION??HE WAS ??VERY NERVOUS? TO SPEAK TO HER. HOWEVER THE TWO HAD SUPPER WHERE WESTWOOD SPOKE PASSIONATELY ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AND WHALES??CLIMATE CHANGE IS A KEY THEME OF THE VENETIAN-SHOT CAMPAIGN CALLED ??MIRROR THE WORLD.? WESTWOOD GAVE KELLER THE LATEST BUTTON SHE HAD DESIGNED WITH THE SLOGAN ??POLITICIANS ARE CRIMINALS? EMBLAZONED ACROSS IT. ??I WEAR IT ALL THE TIME. THIS IS MY TREASURE? HE LAUGHED. THE BURLY KELLER LOVED WEARING THE CLOTHES WESTWOOD PUT HIM IN: ??IT??S WOMENSWEAR BUT ANYONE CAN WEAR IT. YOU DON??T HAVE TO RESTRICT YOURSELF TO THE CLOTHES THAT ARE JUST AIMED AT YOUR GENDER.? *** THE ELOQUENT AND ENGAGING KELLER WAS BORN IN MICHIGAN AND RAISED IN HOUSTON TEXAS. HIS FATHER AN ENGINEER WHO DESIGNED PARKING LOTS CAME FROM A UKRAINIAN WORKING-CLASS FAMILY. KELLER??S MOTHER WAS RAISED IN A VERY STRICT DUTCH REFORM HOUSEHOLD AND BECAME AN EVANGELICAL CHRISTIAN IN THE 1970S. EVERY SUNDAY KELLER THE YOUNGEST OF FOUR CHILDREN JOINED HER AT THE LOCAL ??PENTECOSTAL SPEAKING-IN-TONGUES CHURCH.? (DANDY-ISH AND NOT RELIGIOUS AT ALL KELLER??S FATHER WOULD SIT OUT IN THE BACKYARD EVERY SUNDAY.) GROWING UP GAY WAS ??DIFFICULT IN CERTAIN RESPECTS? BUT IT WAS ALSO A ??NURTURING HOUSEHOLD? KELLER SAID. AS THE YOUNGEST HE WAS SPOILED. HE WAS VERY CURIOUS QUIET AND EASILY ENGAGED BY HIS PARENTS. ??I WAS VERY INTROVERTED. LOOKING BACK ON IT I MAY HAVE BEEN ON THE AUTISM SPECTRUM. SOME OF THAT MAY HAVE BEEN GROWING UP IN TEXAS WHICH WASN??T NURTURING. SCHOOL PUT THE EMPHASIS ON THE SPORTS TEAM. IT WAS OPPRESSIVE.? COMING OUT AT 15 WAS VERY DIFFICULT KELLER SAID. HIS FATHER WAS SUPPORTIVE HIS MOTHER NOT. ??SHE FOUND A BOX OF PORN UNDER MY SINK. THEY CONFRONTED ME ABOUT IT. I WAS HIDING IN MY ROOM AND THROUGH THE DOOR SHE WAS THROWING BIBLE VERSES AT ME. I WAS CRYING. IT WAS VERY EMOTIONAL. AT ONE POINT SHE SAID ??I WISH I HAD A GUN SO I COULD BLOW YOUR BRAINS OUT ALL OVER THE SOFA AND THEN KILL MYSELF.?? ??I REMEMBER THINKING ??WHO??S THE CHRISTIAN NOW? FUCK YOU. YOUR TRUE FAITH IS COMING THROUGH. WHAT??S MORE IMPORTANT TO YOU??? IT WAS A TRUE REVELATION. MY FATHER TOLD HER ??IF YOU EVER TOUCH HIM OR IF HE EVER HURTS HIMSELF I??M GETTING A DIVORCE AND TAKING YOU TO COURT.??? KELLER PAUSED. ??IT WAS NOT A PLEASANT MOMENT FOR ANYBODY AND IT WAS TENSE FOR A WHILE. I ACTUALLY DID TRY TO COMMIT SUICIDE NOT VERY EFFECTIVELY. I TRIED TO DRINK A BOTTLE OF SHAMPOO.? KELLER LAUGHED SOFTLY AT THIS MEMORY. HIS FATHER WAS AWAY THAT WEEKEND??THE WEEKEND AFTER HE HAD COME OUT??AND HIS MOTHER HAD SAID SOMETHING UNKIND TO KELLER AS THEY GOT INTO THE CAR TO GO TO CHURCH. HE RAN UPSTAIRS TO HIS BATHROOM CRYING. HE TOOK A SIP OF THE SHAMPOO AND REALIZED ??THIS ISN??T FOR ME. IT WAS A VERY SERIOUS THING BUT IT WASN??T THAT SMART.? MORE LAUGHTER. ??I DON??T KNOW HOW SERIOUSLY I WANTED TO DIE. I THINK IT WAS REALLY THAT I WAS DESPERATE. I DIDN??T SEE A WAY FORWARD AT THAT POINT IN TIME AND IT WAS A REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE SITUATION TO BE IN. THERE WAS NOBODY TO SUPPORT ME. MY MOTHER CAME UP AND FOUND ME AND SAID ??YOU??RE SO DISGUSTING?? AND THEN OTHER FAMILY AND FRIENDS TOOK CARE OF ME.? SINCE THEN HIS MOTHER HAS ??COME AROUND QUITE A BIT? KELLER SAID. HE STOPPED CALLING HER ??MOM? AND CALLED HER BY HER FIRST NAME ??WHICH REALLY GOT THE POINT ACROSS.? HE SAID HE TOLD HER ??THIS IS WHO I AM YOU HAVE YOUR BELIEFS AND SOME OF YOUR BELIEFS ARE WRONG AND YOU HAVE A CHOICE: YOU LOVE ME THE WAY I AM OR NOT??AND IF NOT THERE ARE REPERCUSSIONS TO THAT.? *** SEXUALLY KELLER THINKS HE TAKES AFTER HIS FATHER ??WHO WAS VERY SEXUAL.? HE ONCE STUMBLED ON HIS DAD??S ??PRETTY EXTENSIVE? PORN COLLECTION. HIS FATHER WHILE DEVOTED TO HIS MOTHER TWICE SEPARATED FROM HER. (THE TIME THEY REUNITED AFTER SPLIT NO. 1 THEY CONCEIVED KELLER HE SAID.) ??SEX IS THE WAY I CAN COMMUNICATE WITH PEOPLE AND ENGAGE WITH PEOPLE? KELLER SAID. ??IT??S VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO TALK TO PEOPLE ESPECIALLY LARGE GROUPS. I KIND OF SHUT DOWN. SEX IS A WAY FOR ME TO ENGAGE OTHER BODIES.? KELLER HAD HIS FIRST SEX AT 19 WHEN HE HIMSELF WAS STILL ??VERY CONSERVATIVE? WITH HIS FIRST PROPER BOYFRIEND. THEY WERE IN A MONOGAMOUS RELATIONSHIP FOR TWO YEARS. HIS MOTHER WOULD LIVE WITH THE TWO OF THEM WITH A ??CERTAIN DEGREE OF ACCEPTANCE.? THE SAME BOYFRIEND HAD MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS AND SCHIZOPHRENIC EPISODES AND WHILE OTHERS IN KELLER??S FAMILY WANTED HIM TO END THE RELATIONSHIP HIS MOTHER SHOWED ??REAL COMPASSION? TOWARD HIS PARTNER WHICH IN TURN HELPED IMPROVE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN KELLER AND HER. ??IT WAS PORN WHICH HELPED ME OPEN UP? KELLER SAID NO LEWD PUN INTENDED. HE WANTED TO BE AN ARTIST AND STUDIED AT AN ART SCHOOL AND THE UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON. (AS WESTWOOD DRESSED HIM FOR THE SHOOT HE SAID ??SHE WAS PUTTING THINGS ON ME LIKE A SCULPTOR OR PAINTER. I THOUGHT ??SHE??S REALLY DOING THIS RIGHT NOW AND I IDENTIFY WITH WHAT SHE??S DOING.???) AFTER HIS FRUSTRATED ART STUDIES SORTIE CAME A B.A. IN ANTHROPOLOGY. BUT STILL ??I COULD NOT FIND A JOB TO SAVE MY LIFE. DESPERATION AND POVERTY AND A LITTLE BIT OF CURIOSITY THROWN INTO THE MIX? LED KELLER TO BEGIN MAKING PORN IN 2004. ??I WATCHED LOT OF IT. I LIKED THE SEAN CODY SITE IN PARTICULAR AND SENT THEM AN APPLICATION. I THOUGHT THEY??D REJECT ME AND WAS SO DEPRESSED I WANTED THAT NEGATIVE AFFIRMATION. I WAS HUNGRY FOR REJECTION.? BUT SEAN CODY SAID YES AND SOON KELLER WAS EARNING $2000 A SHOOT TO FILM VIDEOS AS A ??TOP? (ACTIVE PARTNER). HE NOW EARNS QUADRUPLE THAT??AND EARNS A LOT MORE TO ??BOTTOM.? INITIALLY KELLER SAID HE DID NOT WANT TO WORK WITH STRAIGHT MEN WHO DO GAY-THEMED PORN BUT NOW IT ISN??T A PROBLEM. INDEED OFTEN HE HAS BETTER WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM. ??SOME CAN GET ERECTIONS NOT ALL OF THEM? HE SAID. THEY FAKE IT? ??OH YEAH YOU CAN. A LOT OF FAKING GOES ON.? WITH AN ANGUISHED LOOK MARKS BID KELLER TO SHUSH. THE MAJORITY OF MEN IN GAY PORN ARE STRAIGHT KELLER SAID. ??SOME MIGHT BE ATTRACTED TO MEN A LOT LIKE THE EGO BOOST.? ONE MODEL KELLER FILMED WITH WAS MARRIED TO A WOMAN AND WOULD PROBABLY CALL HIMSELF BISEXUAL. KELLER LAUGHED ??HE REALLY LIKED TO KISS AND SUCK DICK. HE REALLY LIKED ME ??COS I??M A GOOD KISSER.? CONFIRMING HIS IMAGE OF TEXAS AS EXTREMELY CONSERVATIVE KELLER SAID THE STATE WAS THE WORST BY FAR FOR FINDING PARTICIPANTS FOR COLBY DOES AMERICA. ??IT FEELS LIKE IT??S GOTTEN MUCH MORE CONSERVATIVE AND WORSE? HE SAID. ??I COULDN??T FIND ANYONE TO HAVE SEX THERE. ON THE LAST DAY WE FOUND SOMEONE FROM OKLAHOMA TO COME TO HAVE SEX THERE. I HAD BEEN WORRIED ABOUT OKLAHOMA BUT WE FILMED THREE VIDEOS THERE AND COULD HAVE FILMED THREE MORE.? AUSTIN ISN??T A LIBERAL OASIS KELLER INSISTED. ??IT WANTS TO THINK OF ITSELF LIKE THAT. BUT IT??S VERY BOUGIE. THERE??S A STRONG LIBERTARIAN COMMUNITY THERE I GUESS.? WHILE HE HAS ??A LOT OF LOVELY EMPATHETIC FRIENDS? IN TEXAS THE TYPICAL RESPONSE TO A SHIRTLESS PICTURE KELLER WOULD SEND TO MEN OVER GRINDR THERE WAS: ??OH I GUESS YOU NEVER PUT YOUR CLOTHES ON? HE SAID. ??IT WAS VERY ANTI-SEX AND STRAIGHT-LACED.? KENTUCKY WAS A SEX BONANZA???I GOT LUCKY IN KENTUCKY A LOT???AS WERE MISSISSIPPI AND ALABAMA BUT NOT TENNESSEE. WHAT MADE SOME STATES MORE SEXUALLY OPEN THAN OTHERS DID HE THINK? KELLER SAID HE WASN??T SURE BUT SURMISED THAT PEOPLE WERE LESS BUTTONED UP IN MORE LARGELY WORKING-CLASS STATES. IN STATES WHERE THE POPULATION SAW ITSELF AS ASPIRATIONAL AND UPWARDLY MOBILE HE SAID THERE WERE MORE HANG-UPS ABOUT BEING FILMED??AND BEING SEEN POSSIBLY BY OTHERS AND JUDGED. ??I GOT LAID EASILY IN NASHVILLE BUT NO ONE WOULD GET LAID ON CAMERA? HE SAID. CALIFORNIA WAS GOOD. OREGON WAS NOT. WASHINGTON STATE WAS TOUGH BUT NEBRASKA IOWA AND KANSAS WERE HAPPY HUNTING. IN NEW YORK??A CITY FULL OF PEOPLE WANTING TO BE ON CAMERA AND WHO BEHAVE AS IF THEY ARE AND WHERE ONE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED ALL MANNER OF GOOD TIMES TO ROLL??KELLER ULTIMATELY HAD TO HAVE SEX WITH ANOTHER PORN STAR. IF KELLER COULD AFFORD TO HE??D LIKE TO TAKE THIS SEX PROJECT INTERNATIONAL. *** ??IT WAS REALLY DIFFICULT? KELLER SAID OF FIRST MAKING PORN. ??IT TOOK A LOT OF LEARNING TO REALLY FIND A WAY TO BE COMFORTABLE DOING IT. IT??S AN ONGOING LEARNING PROCESS. I??M PROBABLY THE MOST COMFORTABLE THAT I EVER HAVE BEEN. WHEN I FIRST STARTED I WOULD GO SIT IN THE CORNER AND READ A BOOK. IT??S DEFINITELY BEEN A CHALLENGE. ??WHAT??S FUNNY IS THAT THERE ARE GUYS YOU??D THINK YOU??D HAVE A LOT OF CHEMISTRY WITH??YOU FIND THEM ATTRACTIVE OR YOU??VE SEEN THEIR PORN AND YOU??RE REALLY EXCITED TO BE WITH THEM. THEN YOU MEET THEM AND THERE??S NOTHING THERE OR IT??S DIFFICULT. OTHER PEOPLE YOU DON??T EXPECT TO HAVE A GOOD CHEMISTRY WITH AND YOU DO.? THE ONE TIME HE HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH ANOTHER PORN PERFORMER IT WAS A ??DISASTER? HE SAID. THE RELATIONSHIP DIED BECAUSE OF MANY ISSUES ONE OF WHICH WAS COMPETITIVENESS??KELLER WAS MORE FAMOUS THAN HIS PARTNER. ??I DON??T SEEM TO HAVE A PROBLEM FINDING INTIMACY WITH PEOPLE. I AM VERY VERY SEXUAL. I DO LIKE TO HAVE LOT OF SEX. FOR A BOYFRIEND THAT??S KIND OF A GIVEN FROM THE GET-GO??THAT THAT??S WHAT YOU??RE GETTING. ??FOR THE TYPE OF PERSON WHO WANTS A MONOGAMOUS PARTNERSHIP I??M NOT THE PERSON FOR YOU. IT??S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. IF THAT??S WHAT YOU WANT AND YOU??RE ANGRY YOU??RE NOT GETTING IT FROM ME THE PROBLEM IS YOURS. I??VE BEEN PRETTY UPFRONT ABOUT WHO I AM.? MARKS AN ARTIST WRITER AND PERFORMER SAID THE COUPLE HAD MET IN 2006 WHEN HE WAS LIVING IN WASHINGTON D.C. AND KELLER IN BALTIMORE. THEY WERE MARRIED IN JANUARY. KELLER HAD STOOD HIM UP ON THEIR FIRST DATE AND THEN ONE BEAUTIFUL DAY KELLER HAD CALLED HIM TO ASK WHAT HE WAS UP TO. MARKS WAS HEADING TO SEE A DADA EXHIBITION AT THE NATIONAL GALLERY AND KELLER ASKED IF HE COULD COME. THERE WAS A ??PRETTY IMMEDIATE? ATTRACTION. MARKS WAS PARTICULARLY STRUCK THAT KELLER WAS NOT DRESSED AS A TYPICAL MALE WASHINGTON DRONE WEDDED TO WHITE OR BLUE SHIRTS AND KHAKIS: ??EVERYONE??S THE FUCKING SAME.? INSTEAD KELLER WAS ATTIRED IN VINTAGE PLAID SLACKS AND A MULTI-PATTERNED SHIRT WITH A BRIGHT ORANGE BACKPACK AND SIZE 15 PURPLE CONVERSE HIGH-TOPS. ??I THOUGHT ??YOU??RE KIND OF AWESOME??? SAID MARKS. KELLER HIMSELF WORKED FOR A POLITICAL CONSULTANT IN D.C. A ??GREAT LEARNING EXPERIENCE TO SEE THE CITY FOR WHAT IT IS AND HOW GOVERNMENT WORKS. IT??S A FACTORY WHERE MEAT GETS MADE. IF YOU WANT SOMETHING DONE YOU PAY FOR IT AND YOU BRIBE POLITICIANS BASICALLY. IT??S A REALLY DESTRUCTIVE PLACE. YOU REALLY HAVE TO ACCEPT THE IDEA THAT YOU??RE SELLING YOUR SOUL TO THE DEVIL AND EVERYONE IN THE CITY HAS MADE THAT AGREEMENT.? IT WAS BACK TO PORN FULL-TIME AFTER THAT. KELLER SMILED. ??I??VE SPENT THE MAJORITY OF MY ADULT LIFE WORKING IN A CERTAIN BUSINESS. IT??S NOT LIKE I CAN TURN AROUND AND BE A LAWYER.? KELLER HAS ??A LOT OF PEOPLE? WHO HELP HIM MANAGE HIS CELEBRITY AND WHO KEEP HIM AWAY FROM NEGATIVE COMMENTS AND WORSE ONLINE. MOSTLY HIS FANS ARE SWEET AND APPRECIATIVE HE SAID. HE DOESN??T SEE HIMSELF AS A SEX OBJECT EITHER BUT RATHER AS ??SOMEONE THAT PEOPLE CAN IDENTIFY WITH OR CAN SEE THEMSELVES BEING OR BEING LIKE A PART OF ME. I AM CERTAINLY AN OBJECT FOR PEOPLE BUT ALSO LIKE A VESSEL FOR PEOPLE TO SEE THEMSELVES OR SEE THEIR REFLECTION IN ME.? MARKS SAID KELLER??S PORN WORK HAS NEVER BEEN AN ISSUE IN THEIR RELATIONSHIP. AT THE OUTSET FRIENDS WOULD RECOGNIZE KELLER AND ASK THE SAME THING ABOUT WHAT IT WAS LIKE DATING A PORN STAR??LEADING BOTH MEN TO MAKE A DELIBERATELY GROSS VIDEO CALLED ??FUCK MY DIRTY SHITHOLE.? PEOPLE HAD BEEN EXPECTING A VERY DIFFERENT STEAMY VIDEO AND UTTER SILENCE GREETED THE PREMIERE OF THE FILM APART FROM CLOSE FRIENDS WHO LAUGHED UPROARIOUSLY. ??I??M NOT A JEALOUS PERSON? SAID MARKS. ??I??M NOT VERY TRADITIONAL IN A LOT OF WAYS IN HOW I PERCEIVE THE WORLD. I??M VERY LEFTIST MARXIST FOR THE MOST PART. I DON??T CARE ABOUT THE SEXUAL MORES OF A SPECIFIC CULTURE AT A SPECIFIC TIME. I SEE HIM AS AN ARTIST FIRST AND FOREMOST. PORN IS SOMETHING HE HAS DONE TO SUSTAIN HIMSELF FINANCIALLY. AND IT??S A VERY HONEST APPRAISAL OF WHAT CAPITALISM DOES. WE??RE ALL ULTIMATELY WHORING OURSELVES OUT AND WHORING OUR TALENTS OUT.? THERE IS NO JEALOUSY MARKS SAID. THE COUPLE GET THEIR BIGGEST PLEASURE BY SHOPPING FOR THEIR SHARED PASSION VINTAGE CLOTHING INCLUDING A COAT OF MANY COLORS MARKS IS WEARING??A REAL PATCHWORK AND PATTERN VOLCANO??THAT MANY FRIENDS HAVE DECRIED SAID MARKS AND WHICH THIS CORRESPONDENT LOVED AND HAD TO TRY ON. *** KELLER??S FATHER DIED THREE YEARS AGO. HIS MOTHER STILL DOESN??T KNOW WHAT KELLER DOES FOR A LIVING AND HE IS WORRIED??WITH HER POOR HEART HEALTH??KNOWING IT COULD QUITE LITERALLY KILL HER. AS FOR HIS OWN AGING HE PROFESSES TO BE ??SHOCKED AND AMAZED? TO BE IN THE PORN BUSINESS. BUT THE GAY POPULATION ITSELF IS GETTING OLDER AND THERE IS ALWAYS A MARKET FOR HOT OLDER GUYS FOR GUYS OF ALL AGES. SURE KELLER SAID HE GOES TO THE GYM AND WHILE THERE IS ??A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF VANITY THAT COMES WITH BEING IN A BUSINESS WHERE PEOPLE SEE YOUR BALLS EVERY DAY THERE??S A CERTAIN POINT IN MYSELF I KNOW THAT I CAN??T CHANGE THINGS. YOU EITHER ACCEPT AGING OR FIGHT IT IN VAIN.? LESS AND LESS OF A LINE EXISTS BETWEEN PORN AND HIS LIFE KELLER SAID. BECAUSE HE LIKES SEX SO MUCH? ??IT??S BEEN A LONG PROCESS TO LIKE ALLOW MYSELF TO LIKE SEX? HE SAID. ??HONESTLY THAT HASN??T REALLY HAPPENED TILL I DID THIS PROJECT [COLBY DOES AMERICA].? THE SOUR BREAKUP OF ONE RELATIONSHIP LED HIM TO ??I WOULD ALMOST CALL IT AN ASEXUAL OR ANTI-SEXUAL PERIOD. I HAD VERY LITTLE LIBIDO. I WAS ABSTINENT FOR ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS. ??DOING THIS PROJECT MEANS I HAVE TO BE SEXUAL ALL THE TIME AND HAVE A LOT OF SEX AND BE OK HAVING A LOT OF SEX IN A LOT OF WAYS WITH LOTS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF PEOPLE. WHAT??S BEEN GREAT ABOUT IT WHAT??S BEEN POSITIVE IS TO SHOW WHAT IS ENRICHING AND FULFILLING ABOUT SEX AND WHY IT CAN BE A GOOD THING FOR PEOPLE??AND NOT LETTING REACTIONARY CONSERVATIVE NOTIONS ABOUT SEX INFLUENCE MY OWN OPINION OF MYSELF.? THAT CONSERVATISM AROUND SEX KELLER SEES AS BECOMING PART OF THE GAY BODY POLITIC TOO. ??I THINK IF ANYTHING GAY CULTURE HAS GOTTEN MORE CONSERVATIVE? HE SAID. ??THE GAY RIGHTS MOVEMENT??I??D HESITATE TO CALL IT GAY LIBERATION??IS THE HRC [HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN]. THEY WANT GAYS IN THE MILITARY AND HETERONORMATIVE MARRIAGE. THAT??S NOT LIBERATION OR EMANCIPATION OR LIBERATION. THAT??S ??WE WANT YOU TO BE HETEROSEXUALS.?? ??WE HIDE THE SEX. IT??S ??WE??RE JUST LIKE YOU?? WHICH ISN??T TRUE AT ALL. I THINK IT DOES A GREAT DISSERVICE TO GAY CULTURE FOR THOSE TO BE OUR PRIORITIES POLITICALLY. WE CAN??T REALLY HIDE WHO WE ARE AND THAT WILL BECOME A POINT OF CONFLICT OR TENSION. YOU CAN MAKE AS MANY ADVANCES AS POSSIBLE BUT THEY CAN BE TAKEN AWAY FROM YOU IN A MINUTE AND WE HAVE TO BE VIGILANT ABOUT THAT. ??PART OF THAT VIGILANCE COMES WITH ACCEPTING SEXUALITY AS A POSITIVE AND GOOD THING FOR PEOPLE OR TO RECOGNIZE ITS POTENTIAL TO BE THAT AND EMPHASIZE THAT POTENTIAL AND NOT TO DEMONIZE PEOPLE FOR EXPRESSING THEIR SEXUALITY WHATEVER THAT SEXUALITY MIGHT BE. ??THAT??S A LONG PROCESS AND IT INVOLVES A GREAT DEAL OF WORK BUT THAT??S MY BUSINESS AND I FEEL A RESPONSIBILITY TO TAKE ON THAT ROLE.? KELLER PAUSED THEN EMITTED A HEARTY TENSION-RELEASING LAUGH. ????COS? HE SAID SMILING ??I MEAN SEX IS FUN.? ,19933.0

JORDAN AND GLEZMAN WERE SUSPENDED WITH PAY IN MAY FOLLOWING A FEDERAL RAID ON THEIR (LAVISH) HOUSTON-AREA HOMES.

BUT THERE IS MOUNTING EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT THEY EXPERIENCE DOUBLE THE TYPES OF DISCRIMINATION AS THEIR GAY AND LESBIAN PEERS. TWO STUDIES PUBLISHED IN THE DECEMBER 2015 ISSUE OF THE JOURNAL OF BISEXUALITY CONFIRM WHAT BI PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING FOR SOME TIME: THE DISCRIMINATION THEY FACE WITHIN THE LGBT COMMUNITY IS AS REAL AS THE DISCRIMINATION THEY FACE OUTSIDE OF IT. AS THE U.S. ENTERS ITS FIRST FULL YEAR OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY AND THE BATTLE FOR TRANSGENDER RIGHTS CONTINUES THESE STUDIES POINT TO THE PERSISTENT BUT OFTEN IGNORED PROBLEM OF BIPHOBIA AMONG GAY MEN AND LESBIANS. IN ONE STUDY COUNSELING PSYCHOLOGY PHD STUDENT TANGELA ROBERTS AND TWO PROFESSORS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS SURVEYED 745 BISEXUAL PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES OF DISCRIMINATION IN VARIOUS SOCIAL CONTEXTS. THEY FOUND THAT THE BIPHOBIA THEIR RESPONDENTS EXPERIENCED FROM GAY MEN AND LESBIANS WAS NOT EQUAL TO BUT STILL DISTURBINGLY COMPARABLE TO WHAT THEY EXPERIENCED FROM STRAIGHT PEOPLE. ??ALTHOUGH THE LEVEL OF DISCRIMINATION THAT BISEXUALS EXPERIENCED FROM HETEROSEXUALS WHEN COMPARED TO DISCRIMINATION FROM THE LESBIAN AND GAY COMMUNITY WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THE EFFECT SIZE REVEALS THAT THE DEGREE OF DIFFERENCE WAS SMALL? THEIR STUDY CONCLUDED. ??ESSENTIALLY IT??S LIKE SAYING THAT TWO PEOPLE ARE YELLING AT YOU BUT ONE VOICE IS A DECIBEL HIGHER? ROBERTS EXPLAINED TO THE DAILY BEAST. ??YES STATISTICALLY ONE VOICE IS MORE SIGNIFICANT BUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO VOICES IS SMALL.? THE SURVEY FOR THE STUDY ASKED BISEXUAL PEOPLE TO COMPLETE AN ANTI-BISEXUAL EXPERIENCES SCALE (ABES) WHICH ASKED ON A SCALE FROM 1 TO 6 HOW FREQUENTLY CERTAIN EVENTS HAVE HAPPENED TO THEM SUCH AS BEING TOLD THAT THEY WERE ??CONFUSED? ABOUT THEIR ORIENTATION BEING ??EXCLUDED FROM SOCIAL NETWORKS? OR HAVING IT BE ASSUMED THAT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO CHEAT BECAUSE THEY ARE BISEXUAL. AS THE STUDY SADLY INDICATED THESE ATTITUDES ARE COMMON NOT JUST AMONG STRAIGHT PEOPLE BUT AMONG GAY MEN AND LESBIANS AS WELL. THE AVERAGE ABES SCORE REPORTED FOR EXPERIENCES WITH STRAIGHT PEOPLE WAS 2.38. THE AVERAGE FOR EXPERIENCES AMONG GAY MEN AND LESBIANS WAS ONLY SLIGHTLY LOWER AT 2.29. ROBERTS BELIEVES THAT HER RESEARCH SHEDS LIGHT ON A TROUBLING BUT OFTEN IGNORED FAULT LINE WITHIN THE LGBT POPULATION. ??THIS IS THE THING THAT ISN??T TALKED ABOUT? SHE SAID. ??IT??S LIKE AIRING OUT THE DIRTY LAUNDRY OF THE SUPPOSED ??LGBT COMMUNITY.?? IT??S SAYING ??LOOK WE HAVEN??T BEEN ACTING LIKE THIS COMMUNITY THAT WE??RE SUPPOSED TO BE AND WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.??? AT THE CENTRE FOR ADDICTION AND MENTAL HEALTH IN TORONTO POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH FELLOW COREY FLANDERS AND HER CO-AUTHORS CAME TO A SIMILAR CONCLUSION. SEVERAL OF THE 35 YOUNG BISEXUAL WOMEN THEY INTERVIEWED ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH FOR THEIR STUDY IN THE JOURNAL OF BISEXUALITY DESCRIBED FEELING EXCLUDED WITHIN LGBT SPACES. ??[A] COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I WENT TO PRIDE AND I TOOK MY BOYFRIEND WITH ME BECAUSE HE JUST WANTED TO BE SUPPORTIVE AND COME WITH ME TO THIS THING THAT??S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME? ONE INTERVIEWEE SAID. ??[WE] DID A MARCH AND AT THE END OF IT I WAS FEELING REALLY HAPPY AND EXCITED AND WE KISSED AND PEOPLE STARTED BOOING US.? ??[T]HAT WAS REALLY HURTFUL FOR ME? SHE ADDED ??BECAUSE IT WAS LIKE BEING REJECTED BY MY OWN COMMUNITY BASED ON THESE WRONG ASSUMPTIONS THEY WERE MAKING ABOUT ME.? FLANDERS TOLD THE DAILY BEAST THAT BIPHOBIA AMONG GAY MEN AND LESBIANS ??CERTAINLY COMES UP FREQUENTLY AMONG PARTICIPANTS IN DISCUSSIONS OF BISEXUAL MENTAL HEALTH.? ??WITH GAY AND LESBIAN INDIVIDUALS [SOCIAL SUPPORT] CAN BE ACCESSED IN QUEER COMMUNITY SPACES IF NOT IN PREDOMINANTLY HETEROSEXUAL SPACES? SHE SAID. ??WITH BISEXUAL INDIVIDUALS THIS IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE.? LEFT WITH FEW PLACES TO FIND UNQUALIFIED SUPPORT IT MAY NOT BE SURPRISING THAT BISEXUAL PEOPLE HAVE SOME OF THE WORST MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES OF ANY SEXUAL ORIENTATION. A LARGE 2010 STUDY IN THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH FOUND THAT BISEXUAL MEN AND WOMEN HAD A HIGHER PREVALENCE OF MOOD AND ANXIETY DISORDERS AS COMPARED TO GAY MEN LESBIANS AND HETEROSEXUALS. ONE EXAMPLE: NEARLY 60 PERCENT OF BISEXUAL WOMEN HAD A LIFETIME HISTORY OF MOOD DISORDER COMPARED TO ABOUT 45 PERCENT OF LESBIANS AND A LITTLE OVER 30 PERCENT OF HETEROSEXUAL WOMEN. ??PERVASIVE STEREOTYPES AND NEGATIVE ATTITUDES ABOUT BISEXUALITY ARE PRESENT NOT ONLY AMONG THE ??DOMINANT?? HETEROSEXUAL POPULATION BUT AMONG LESBIAN AND GAY POPULATIONS AS WELL RESULTING IN A ??DOUBLE STIGMA?? FOR BISEXUALS? THE AUTHORS WROTE IN AN ATTEMPT TO ACCOUNT FOR THE ALARMINGLY HIGH RATES OF DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY AMONG BISEXUALS. ROBERTS FLANDERS AND OTHER LGBT SCHOLARS HAVE BEGUN TO LABEL THIS ??DOUBLE STIGMA? AS ??MONOSEXISM? A SPECIFIC FORM OF PREJUDICE AGAINST THOSE WHO ARE ATTRACTED TO MORE THAN ONE GENDER. AS USED IN THEIR RESEARCH THE TERM FUNCTIONS AS A CATCH-ALL FOR BOTH THE HETEROSEXUAL STIGMATIZATION OF BISEXUALITY AND THE QUESTIONING OF BI IDENTITY AMONG MEMBERS OF OTHER SEXUAL MINORITIES. ??IT??S ESSENTIALLY THINKING THAT THE ONLY ??TRUE?? SEXUAL ORIENTATIONS ARE HETEROSEXUAL LESBIAN AND/OR GAY? ROBERTS TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. ??ALL OTHER SEXUAL ORIENTATIONS ARE DEEMED TO BE ILLEGITIMATE NOT REAL OR JUST A PRODUCT OF CONFUSION.? ROBERTS WHO OPENLY IDENTIFIES AS BISEXUAL HERSELF SAYS THAT SHE HAS ALWAYS KNOWN FROM HER OWN EXPERIENCES THAT MONOSEXISM WAS A PROBLEM AMONG GAY MEN AND LESBIANS BUT THAT IT WAS ??HEARTBREAKING? TO SEE HER PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE VERIFIED EMPIRICALLY. ??WHILE DOING THIS STUDY I HAD ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS WHERE I WAS SITTING THERE INTERPRETING THE DATA AND ONCE I REALIZED WHAT THE NUMBERS WERE TELLING ME I FELT THIS IMMENSE SADNESS FOR THE PARTICIPANTS FOR MYSELF AND FOR THIS CONCEPT OF A ??LGBT COMMUNITY?? THAT WE??VE TOLD OURSELVES IS FUNCTIONING AND SUPPORTIVE? SHE SAID. THE ONE SILVER LINING OF ROBERTS?? STUDY WAS THAT BISEXUAL PEOPLE WHO FELT ACCEPTED BY FRIENDS AND FAMILY REPORTED LOWER ABES SCORES THAN THOSE WHO LACKED A SUPPORT NETWORK. BUT THIS FINDING MAY BE COLD COMFORT TO A SEXUAL MINORITY THAT REMAINS LARGELY CLOSETED LONG AFTER MANY GAY MEN AND LESBIANS IN THE U.S. HAVE ALREADY COME OUT. ACCORDING TO ESTIMATES FROM THE WILLIAMS INSTITUTE AT UCLA BISEXUAL PEOPLE ARE MORE NUMEROUS THAN GAY MEN AND LESBIANS COMBINED BUT ACCORDING TO A 2013 PEW SURVEY THEY ARE THE MOST LIKELY TO BE IN THE CLOSET WITH JUST 28 PERCENT REPORTING THAT ??ALL OR MOST OF THE IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN THEIR LIFE? KNOW ABOUT THEIR ORIENTATION. THAT SAME PEW SURVEY FOUND THAT BISEXUAL PEOPLE WERE THE SEXUAL MINORITY LEAST LIKELY TO BELIEVE THAT LGBT PEOPLE ARE SOCIALLY ACCEPTED WITH 28 PERCENT SAYING THAT THERE WAS ??ONLY A LITTLE? OR NO ACCEPTANCE OF LGBT PEOPLE. THOSE NUMBERS MAY NOT BUDGE FOR BISEXUALS UNTIL COMING OUT IS A LESS RISKY COURSE OF ACTION. ROBERTS?? STUDY FOUND THAT DESPITE THE SUBSET OF PEOPLE WHO HAD SUPPORTIVE FRIENDS AND FAMILY ??PARTICIPANTS WHO WERE OUT TO FAMILY AND FRIENDS REPORTED GREATER ANTIBISEXUAL DISCRIMINATION.? ??[T]HE FACT THAT OUTNESS TO FAMILY AND FRIENDS WAS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO ANTIBISEXUAL DISCRIMINATION IS CONCERNING SUGGESTING THAT BISEXUAL PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT MAY BE VULNERABLE TO DISCRIMINATION IN MANY CONTEXTS? THE STUDY NOTED. SEVERAL OF FLANDERS?? INTERVIEWEES ALSO RELAYED THAT COMING OUT WAS AS THE RESEARCHERS SUMMARIZED ??AN EXHAUSTING PROCESS? DUE TO THE WIDESPREAD MISUNDERSTANDINGS OF BISEXUALITY THEY ENCOUNTERED FROM THEIR FRIENDS. ONE PARTICIPANT SAID THAT WHEN SHE CAME OUT TO A STRAIGHT MALE LOVE INTEREST HE REPLIED ??OH YOU??RE A LESBIAN.? AFTER SHE TRIED TO EXPLAIN HE SAID ??UH I JUST THINK OF YOU AS A LESBIAN IN MY HEAD IT??S EASIER FOR ME.? CRUCIALLY IT??S NOT JUST STRAIGHT PEOPLE WHO CAN MAKE COMING OUT AN ORDEAL FOR BISEXUAL PEOPLE. LAST FEBRUARY WHEN KATE BROWN BECAME THE FIRST OPENLY BISEXUAL GOVERNOR AN OLD ESSAY OF HERS RESURFACED IN WHICH SHE RECALLED BEING CALLED ??HALF-QUEER? BY HER GAY FRIENDS AFTER REVEALING HER ORIENTATION. LIKE BROWN MANY BISEXUAL PEOPLE ARE DISHEARTENED TO FIND THEIR IDENTITIES INTERROGATED BY PEOPLE WHO ARE OSTENSIBLY PART OF THE SAME COMMUNITY. THERE IS A B AFTER ALL IN LGBT. AS BI ACTIVIST ANNA AAGENES RECALLED IN A BLOG POST ??FINDING THE LGBT COMMUNITY WAS LIKE JOINING A NEW CLUB THAT I (TECHNICALLY) BELONGED TO BUT WHEN I ARRIVED TO PICK UP MY TOWEL AND COMPLIMENTARY GYM PASS MY MEMBERSHIP WAS CALLED INTO QUESTION.? AND IF IT WASN??T CLEAR BEFORE THE LATEST ISSUE OF THE JOURNAL OF BISEXUALITY IT??S BECOMING HARDER TO DENY NOW: BIPHOBIA WITHIN THE LGBT COMMUNITY IS NOT A MINOR INTERNAL CONFLICT BUT A SIGNIFICANT FORM OF PREJUDICE THAT IS ALMOST CERTAINLY HAVING A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON BISEXUAL PEOPLE??S MENTAL HEALTH. ?Ÿ??THIS [FORM OF] EXCLUSION MAY ACCOUNT FOR SOME OF THE ELEVATED NEGATIVE MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES AMONG BISEXUAL PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT ONLY EXPERIENCING DISCRIMINATION FROM HETEROSEXUAL PEOPLE BUT FROM GAY AND LESBIAN PEOPLE AS WELL? FLANDERS TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. WHAT CAN BE DONE TO COUNTERACT THESE NEGATIVE EFFECTS? ROBERTS THINKS IT??S TIME TO FINALLY AIR THE DIRTY LAUNDRY OF MONOSEXISM AND CONFRONT THE STIGMA THAT PREVENTS BISEXUAL PEOPLE FROM FEELING LIKE THE B IN LGBT IS MORE THAN JUST A GESTURE. ??REALISTICALLY THERE ARE CHANGES THAT NEED TO HAPPEN BIASES THAT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT AND LONG-HELD DISCRIMINATORY BELIEFS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED? SHE SAID. ??THIS MUST HAPPEN BEFORE WE CAN REALLY GET TO A POINT WHERE WE CAN SAY THAT THESE COMMUNITIES ARE FOR ALL NON-HETEROSEXUAL INDIVIDUALS NOT JUST THE LESBIAN AND GAY ONES.? ,36075.0

CONSIDER THE FACT THAT IN 2005 ANDREA CONSTAND TOLD POLICE THAT BILL COSBY GAVE HER DRUGS AND SEXUALLY ASSAULTED HER. WHY WASN??T HE CHARGED? THE PROSECUTOR DIDN??T THINK THERE WAS ENOUGH EVIDENCE. TEN YEARS LATER COSBY IS CHARGED. WHY? PARTLY BECAUSE OF NEW BITS OF EVIDENCE??COSBY??S ADMISSION THAT HE SOMETIMES GAVE WOMEN DRUGS IN ORDER TO HAVE SEX WITH THEM AND AT LEAST 50 OTHER ACCUSATIONS AGAINST HIM. BUT MOSTLY BECAUSE NOW THERE??S A DIFFERENT PROSECUTOR KEVIN STEELE. THESE ARE JUDGMENT CALLS IN 2005 AND 2015. NOW CONSIDER THE CASES OF TAMIR RICE MICHAEL BROWN AND ERIC GARNER. NONE OF THE POLICE OFFICERS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR DEATHS WERE EVER CHARGED??NOT CONVICTED??CHARGED. IN ALL THREE CASES PROSECUTORS PRACTICALLY TOLD GRAND JURIES NOT TO INDICT. IN FERGUSON ROBERT MCCULLOCH DECIDED TO SIMPLY PRESENT ALL THE EVIDENCE TO THE GRAND JURY RATHER THAN MAKE A CASE AGAINST OFFICER DARREN WILSON. IN STATEN ISLAND DARREN DONOVAN A REPUBLICAN WITH EXTENSIVE TIES TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT FAILED TO SECURE AN INDICTMENT AGAINST DANIEL PANTALEO WHOSE CHOKEHOLD LED TO ERIC GARNER??S DEATH. AND MOST RECENTLY IN CLEVELAND TIM MCGINTY STATED OPENLY THAT HE DIDN??T BELIEVE ANYONE SHOULD BE CHARGED IN THE SHOOTING OF 12-YEAR-OLD TAMIR RICE. SET ASIDE FOR THE MOMENT THE FACTS OF THESE CASES. WHAT??S STRIKING IN ALL OF THEM IS THAT COUNTY PROSECUTORS AND DISTRICT ATTORNEYS SINGLEHANDEDLY AND WITHOUT OVERSIGHT DECIDE THE FATES OF THE ACCUSED. MORE JUDGMENT CALLS UNREVIEWED AND UNREVIEWABLE. TRUE THERE IS SOME OVERSIGHT: MOST OF THESE PROSECUTORS ARE ELECTED. IF VOTERS DON??T LIKE HOW THEY??RE DOING (OR NOT DOING) THEIR JOBS THEY CAN VOTE THEM OUT OF OFFICE. INDEED IN THE CASE OF BILL COSBY THEN-D.A. BRUCE CASTOR??S DECISION NOT TO INDICT IN 2005 BECAME AN ISSUE IN HIS ELECTION BATTLE WITH KEVIN STEELE THIS YEAR. BUT IS THIS REALLY ??OVERSIGHT?? AS THE DAILY BEAST REPORTED LAST SEPTEMBER VOTERS OFTEN KNOW NEXT TO NOTHING ABOUT THE CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR POSITIONS AS PROSECUTORS OR JUDGES. TURNOUT IS EXTREMELY LOW ESPECIALLY IN OFF YEARS. AND WHEN VOTERS ARE PAYING ATTENTION THEY ARE BAMBOOZLED BY THE ONLY CAMPAIGN MESSAGE THAT SEEMS TO WORK: ??TOUGH ON CRIME.? THIS YEAR FOR EXAMPLE STEELE RAN ON HIS ??98 PERCENT CONVICTION RATE? AND ??TOUGH SENTENCES FOR SEXUAL PREDATORS.? THAT??S WHAT PEOPLE WANT RIGHT? THEY SEE PROSECUTORS AS AGENTS OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND EVERYONE WANTS LESS CRIME. THIS LEADS TO TWO PERVERSE INCENTIVES FOR PROSECUTORS. FIRST THEY HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO OVER-CHARGE CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS AND SECURE CONVICTIONS MORE THAN JUSTICE. SECOND THEY HAVE AN INCENTIVE NOT TO CHARGE POLICE OFFICERS WHO AFTER ALL ARE FIGHTING CRIME EVERY DAY AND WITH WHOM THEY WORK CLOSELY ON A DAILY BASIS. IN PRINCIPLE IF OFFICERS PANTALEO WILSON AND LOEHMANN VIOLATED THE LAW THEN THEY ARE CRIMINALS. BUT IN PRACTICE THEY ARE POLICEMEN AND PERCEIVED AS THE OPPOSITE OF CRIMINALS. VOTERS WHO WANT TO GET TOUGH ON CRIME DO NOT WANT TO GET TOUGH ON COPS. SO NOT ONLY IS THERE NO MEANINGFUL OVERSIGHT OF PROSECUTORS BUT THE OVERSIGHT THAT DOES EXIST IS SKEWED TO SPECIFIC OUTCOMES AND BEHAVIORS NOT IMPARTIALITY AND PERFORMANCE. NOW BACK TO COSBY. IF YOU PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO WHAT STEELE SAID THIS WEEK YOU??LL NOTICE THAT HE WENT OUT OF HIS WAY TO MENTION THE NEW EVIDENCE THAT HAS COME TO LIGHT IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS. ??A PROSECUTOR??S JOB IS TO FOLLOW THE EVIDENCE WHEREVER IT LEADS AND WHENEVER IT COMES TO LIGHT? HE SAID ANNOUNCING THE ARREST. IN PART THIS WAS TO EXPLAIN THE NEARLY TWELVE-YEAR GAP BETWEEN THE CRIME AND THE CHARGE. BUT IN LARGE PART IT WAS TO EXPLAIN WHY COSBY IS BEING CHARGED IN 2015 BUT WASN??T IN 2005. AND WHAT IS THAT NEW EVIDENCE? ONLY WHAT IS KNOWN AS ??HABIT EVIDENCE?: THAT COSBY ADMITTED TO DRUGGING AND HAVING SEX WITH OTHER WOMEN. BUT NOT CONSTAND??HOWEVER LUDICROUS IT MAY SEEM COSBY??S POSITION IS THAT SHE CONSENTED. IS HABIT EVIDENCE REALLY ENOUGH TO REOPEN A CLOSED CASE AND FILE CHARGES? AGAIN THAT??S ANOTHER JUDGMENT CALL. LIKE JUDGE ROBRENO??S DECISION TO UNSEAL THE DAMNING DEPOSITION RECORDS STEELE??S DECISION WAS BASICALLY UP TO HIM. OF COURSE STEELE CHOSE TO MAKE IT AN ELECTION ISSUE AS WELL. HE??D LOOK FOOLISH IF HAVING JUST ACCUSED BRUCE CASTOR OF DOING NOTHING HE DID NOTHING TOO. BUT AGAIN THAT WAS STEELE??S DECISION. JUST AS PROSECUTING ??AMERICA??S DAD? IN 2005 MIGHT HAVE MADE CASTOR LOO BAD PROSECUTING AMERICA??S RAPIST IN 2015 MAKES STEELE LOOK GOOD. WE IMAGINE THAT DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND OTHER PROSECUTORS ARE MOTIVATED BY TRUTH JUSTICE AND THE AMERICAN WAY. BUT IN FACT THEY ARE ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO PAINT IN BROAD STROKES FOR A MOSTLY-IGNORANT PUBLIC WHO UNLIKE JUDGES CANNOT BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR MISCONDUCT BY OVERSIGHT BOARDS AND WHO EXERCISE DISCRETION SO BROAD THAT THE DISPOSITION OF JUSTICE OFTEN LIES ENTIRELY WITHIN THEIR JUDGMENT. FINALLY OF COURSE TAMIR RICE AND BILL COSBY HAVE MORE IN COMMON THAN UNDER-ZEALOUS PROSECUTORS: BOTH AFRICAN AMERICAN MALES ONE QUITE YOUNG AND ONE QUITE OLD OPERATING IN A SYSTEM IN WHICH 95 PERCENT OF PROSECUTORS ARE WHITE AND LOCAL POLICE FORCES ARE 88 PERCENT WHITE. FOR DECADES COSBY WAS PROTECTED BY HIS WEALTH CELEBRITY CLASS AND CONNECTIONS PARTICULARLY AT TEMPLE UNIVERSITY. BUT HE IS THE EXCEPTION NOT THE RULE. BLACK MEN COMPRISE 6 PERCENT OF THE U.S. POPULATION BUT 35 PERCENT OF THE PRISON POPULATION. THEY RECEIVE SENTENCES ROUGHLY 10 PERCENT MORE SEVERE THAN WHITE DEFENDANTS CONVICTED OF IDENTICAL CRIMES. AND WHEN THEY ARE PERCEIVED TO BE OLDER THAN THEY ARE BIGGER THAN THEY ARE MORE DANGEROUS THAN THEY ARE OR MORE VIOLENT THAN THEY ARE THEIR 88 PERCENT-WHITE POLICE OFFICERS AND 95 PERCENT-WHITE-PROSECUTORS EXERCISE ??DISCRETION? IN REMARKABLY SIMILAR WAYS. THE UNITED STATES IS THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD THAT ELECTS PROSECUTORS BASED ON SLOGANEERING AND THEN HOLDS THEM TO NO STANDARD OTHER THAN MAJORITY WHIM. AFTER NEARLY 12 YEARS BILL COSBY HAS INDEED BEEN CHARGED WITH A CRIME. BUT ONLY BECAUSE A PROSECUTOR DECIDED TO DO SO??THIS TIME. ,13595.0

IN FACT MOST OF WHAT YOU??LL FIND IN SHADES OF BLUE IS SHADES OF SIMILAR (ARGUABLY BETTER) SHOWS ABOUT CROOKED COPS THAT CAME BEFORE IT. SO WHY NOT JUST WATCH THE SHIELD OR THE WIRE THEN WHICH TREAD MUCH SIMILAR GROUND DID IT WITHOUT THE CONSTRAINTS OF BROADCAST STANDARDS AND ARE READILY AVAILABLE ON STREAMING? THEY DON??T STAR JENNIFER LOPEZ OF COURSE. IT SEEMS LIKE A MILLENNIUM AGO WHEN IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT LOPEZ WOULD BE STARRING IN AN NBC COP SERIES.

IT??S ON-BRAND WITH HER CONQUERING OF EVERY OTHER MEDIUM SHE??S TAKEN ON: CREATE SOMETHING MEDIOCRE WORK FOUR TIMES HARDER THAN ANYONE ELSE WOULD ON IT TURN IT INTO SOMETHING ACTUALLY WORTH CONSUMING AND LOOK FINE AS HELL WHILE DOING IT. BECAUSE SHADES OF BLUE IS NOT THE NEXT GREAT COP DRAMA. BUT IT??S??WELL IT??S FINE.

HARLEE GETS NABBED BY THE FBI WHILE ORCHESTRATING ONE OF HER DIRTY DEALS. THE FBI COERCES HER INTO BEING A MOLE TO TAKE DOWN WOZNIAK. WOZNIAK SUSPECTS THERE??S A MOLE. HE SUSPECTS IT??S HER! THE CAT-AND-MOUSE GAME ENSUES AND YOU KNOW WHAT JENNIFER LOPEZ AND RAY LIOTTA ARE EXCELLENT CATS AND MICE! THERE??S STRONG DIRECTION HERE TOO KEEPING YOU RIVETED AT LEAST THROUGH THE THREE EPISODES I??VE SEEN SEIZING ON LOPEZ??S CONTROLLED PERFORMANCE TO GROUND THINGS AS THE TWISTS GET LOOPIER AND LOOPIER. (CLOSETED HOMOSEXUALITY BABY DADDY DRAMA AND POSSIBLE HATE CRIMES ALL POP UP.) THE FIRST TWO EPISODES ARE DIRECTED BY BARRY LEVINSON AN ALUM OF HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREETS ANOTHER SERIES WITH A HEAVY INFLUENCE ON SHADES. LEVINSON KNOWS HIS WAY AROUND A GOOD GRITTY COP DRAMA AND IT SHOWS. HIS ACTION SET PIECES ARE THRILLING. THE PILOT ALONE PAIRS SEVERAL KEY ACTION SCENES WITH SONGS LIKE ??NO CHURCH IN THE WILD? ??BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE? AND ??CHANDELIER? AND THEY ARE FUN. BUT LET??S BE HONEST: NONE OF THAT IS IMPORTANT. THIS IS THE JENNIFER LOPEZ SHOW AND FOR ALL THE THINGS THAT SHADES OF BLUE HAS GOING FOR AND AGAINST IT THAT??S THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS. IS J.LO GOOD IN IT? YES. AND WILL IT HELP HER CAREER? YES! FEW CELEBRITIES BOAST AS MAGNETIC A CAMERA PRESENCE OR HAVE AS MUCH TANGIBLE CHARM AS JENNIFER LOPEZ. IT??S WHY SHE BECAME ONE OF THE LAST BANKABLE ROM-COM STARS IN THE EARLY 2000S ON THE BACKS OF SO-SO FARE LIKE THE WEDDING PLANNER AND MAID IN MANHATTAN.

AS LOPEZ NAVIGATES NEW ROUTES IN HER TANGLED MAZE OF A CAREER THIS IS AN IMPORTANT REMINDER OF THE STRENGTH OF HER ABILITIES AS AN ACTOR AND A POWERHOUSE CAPABLE OF CARRYING A SEASON OF A NETWORK SHOW. SHE??S COOL CONFIDENT AND TOUGH. SHE??S IN AN ACTING BATTLE OF WITS WITH RAY LIOTTA AND COMING OUT ON TOP. THAT VULNERABILITY THAT SEPINWALL REFERS TO SEEPS THROUGH MORE THAN SOME MAY LIKE BUT I APPRECIATE THE EXCUSE THE PUN SHADES IT ALLOWS IN HER PERFORMANCE. SHE AND THE REST OF THE SHOW??S CREATIVE TEAM MAKE YOU CARE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO HARLEE WHILE STILL MAKING YOU FEEL LIKE SHE??S IN REAL DANGER.

1211,10312607.0,2016-01-26T22:45:00+00:00,TIME FOR AMERICANS TO WORRY ABOUT ZIKA VIRUS?,THE ARKANSAS DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH (DOH) TODAY ANNOUNCED THAT A RESIDENT HAD TESTED POSITIVE FOR ZIKA VIRUS JOINING AT LEAST A DOZEN OTHER CASES OF ZIKA FOUND THUS FAR IN THE US. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS CERTAIN TO SCARE MANY. ZIKA HAS ALL THE ELEMENTS OF YET ANOTHER RUNAWAY EPIDEMIC INCLUDING STAGGERING CASE COUNTS AND DEVASTATING COMPLICATIONS. HOWEVER IN THE ALARMING NEWS FROM LITTLE ROCK AND A RELATED UPDATE FROM THE CDC THERE IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FACT: THUS FAR ALL US CASES HAVE OCCURRED IN TRAVELERS RETURNING FROM ALREADY ENDEMIC AREAS. NO CASES IN THE US HAVE BEEN DUE TO LOCAL ACQUISITION OR TRANSMISSION CALLED AUTOCHTHONOUS. THAT MEANS THAT IF YOU STAY IN THE US YOU ARE SAFE. FOR NOW. THE PROBLEM AS DETAILED IN AN UPDATE FROM PAHO (THE PAN AMERICAN HEALTH ORGANIZATION A PARTNER OF WHO) IS THAT THE MOSQUITOS THAT CARRY ZIKA ARE KNOWN TO BE IN THE US. THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF MOSQUITOS KNOWN TO MOVE ZIKA VIRUS FROM HERE TO THERE: AEDES AEGYPTI AND AEDES ALBOPICTUS. AS THIS MAP FROM THE CDC DEMONSTRATES AEDES MOSQUITOS ARE THRIVING SOUTH OF THE MASON-DIXON LINE. TO RAMP UP THE ZIKA EPIDEMIC IN THE US ONE OF TWO DISTINCT EVENTS NEEDS TO OCCUR. ONE IS A HOSTILE TAKEOVER: INFECTED MOSQUITOS COULD SWARM NORTH AND JOIN THEIR CONFEDERATES ALREADY BUZZING OVER ALABAMA AND GEORGIA. GIVEN THE WAY THAT MOSQUITOS MOVE ALONG THIS IS AN INEVITABILITY SOONER OR LATER??BUT PROBABLY NOT THIS YEAR. THE CHIKUNGUNYA VIRUS IS CARRIED BY THE SAME MOSQUITOS AND HAS CAUSED MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES IN THE CARIBBEAN??YET THE INFECTED MOSQUITOS THUS FAR HAVE FAILED TO MAKE GEOGRAPHIC INROADS INTO THE US (THOUGH A LITTLE AUTOCHTHONOUS TRANSMISSION HAS OCCURRED). THE OTHER WAY TO KICK-START AN EPIDEMIC IS ALSO UNLIKELY AT LEAST ANY TIME SOON. IF A CRITICAL MASS OF INFECTED PEOPLE HANG AROUND TOGETHER THEY CAN GIVE UNINFECTED MOSQUITOS A CHANCE TO CATCH ZIKA LOCALLY. HERE??S HOW IT WORKS: LET??S SAY SEVERAL AIRPLANES FULL OF PEOPLE FROM CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA RETURN NEXT WEEK FROM MARDI GRAS IN BRAZIL NEWLY INFECTED. SINCE IT IS FEBRUARY AND RELATIVELY FEW MOSQUITOS ARE CIRCULATING PROBABLY LITTLE WILL OCCUR. BUT SAY THE SAME LARGE GROUP DECIDES TO GO TO THE SUMMER OLYMPICS IN BRAZIL AND THERE BECOME INFECTED. ON THEIR RETURN THEY WILL HAVE LOTS OF ZIKA IN THEIR BLOOD STREAMS AND LOTS OF THIRSTY CAROLINIAN AEDES MOSQUITOS LOOKING FOR A MEAL. BINGO??A PERFECT MESS. THE KEY IS THAT MOSQUITOS ARE BASICALLY INEFFICIENT AND RELY ON BIG NUMBERS TO SPREAD DISEASE. IF ONLY A FEW PEOPLE IN A TOWN HAVE ZIKA THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A MOSQUITO WILL FIND AN INFECTED PERSON TAKE A BLOOD MEAL NOT DIE AND GO BITE AN UNINFECTED PERSON IS EXTREMELY LOW. BUT IF HUNDREDS OF INFECTED PEOPLE ARE MILLING AROUND THE WORK FOR THE AEDES MOSQUITO IS SIMPLE AND INEVITABLE??AS THE BRAZILIAN OUTBREAK ATTESTS. IN THE WEEKS AHEAD ONE THING IS CERTAIN: MANY MANY MORE PEOPLE IN THE US WILL BE DIAGNOSED WITH ZIKA VIRUS. THIS IS BECAUSE DOCTORS WILL BE TESTING MORE AND ZIKA WHICH IS ASYMPTOMATIC IN 80 PERCENT OF THOSE INFECTED SURELY WILL BE FOUND. BUT AS LONG AS ALL THE CASES ARE IMPORTED AS IS CURRENTLY THE SITUATION THE FEAR FACTOR IN THE US SHOULD REMAIN QUITE LOW. HOWEVER IF AND WHEN WE ENTER INTO AUTOCHTHONOUS TRANSMISSION THINGS COULD GET VERY UGLY VERY FAST. THERE APPEARS TO BE ALMOST NO NATIVE IMMUNITY??MEANING THAT EPIDEMICS AFFECTING MILLIONS AS IS OCCURRING IN BRAZIL WOULD HAPPEN HERE. THEREFORE OUR MAIN PROTECTION RIGHT NOW AS WE WAIT ONCE AGAIN FOR A VACCINE TO COME ALONG IS NOT SHOTS OR ANTIVIRALS OR MAGIC PILLS??BUT MOSQUITO CONTROL. THIS IS THE SAME CHALLENGE THAT THE US MET SUCCESSFULLY AFTER WORLD WAR TWO WHEN MALARIA WAS DRIVEN OUT OF THE US SOUTH. HOPEFULLY WE WILL COORDINATE EFFORTS AGAINST ZIKA VIRUS AND THE AEDES MOSQUITOS IN THE SAME PURPOSEFUL NON-POLITICALLY DISTORTED MANNER. ,18123.0

TED CRUZ BEFORE IT??S TOO LATE ,FOR THE PAST MONTH AND CHANGE THERE??S BEEN A VOID IN THE POLITICAL COMMENTARY ARENA??AND POLITICAL INCORRECTNESS IN GENERAL. YES BILL MAHER WAS ON VACATION. BUT THE ACERBIC SATIRIST SEEMS RECHARGED AND READY TO DIVE HEADFIRST INTO ELECTION SEASON??WHICH HE??LL DO BY KICKING OFF THE RETURN OF HIS LATE-NIGHT SERIES REAL TIME WITH BILL MAHER WITH A BIG CAMPAIGN OF HIS OWN. YOU??LL HAVE TO TUNE IN TO HBO FRIDAY NIGHT TO SEE EXACTLY WHAT IT IS. ALL TEASING ASIDE MAHER??S BUILT UP A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF CYNICISM DURING HIS TV ABSENCE AS HE??S OBSERVED THE MINDBOGGLING RISE OF DONALD TRUMP TO LEADING GOP CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT??THIS DESPITE A TROUBLING HISTORY OF ??SEXIST? AND ??XENOPHOBIC? BEHAVIOR??AS WELL AS THAT OF TEA PARTIER TED CRUZ (R-TX). THE DAY AFTER PRESIDENT OBAMA??S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS??AND SOUTH CAROLINA GOVERNOR NIKKI HALEY??S TRUMP-BASHING RESPONSE??AND HOURS BEFORE THE NEW YORK TIMES BROKE THE NEWS THAT CRUZ HAD FAILED TO DISCLOSE UP TO $1 MILLION IN LOANS FROM GOLDMAN SACHS WHICH HE USED TO FINANCE HIS SENATE RUN THE DAILY BEAST SPOKE TO MAHER ABOUT THE 2016 ELECTION INCLUDING WHY CRUZ SCARES HIM EVEN MORE THAN TRUMP AND THE BIG SCANDAL THAT MAY DASH HILLARY CLINTON??S PRESIDENTIAL HOPES. IT??S GOOD TIMING FOR OUR CHAT THE DAY AFTER PRESIDENT OBAMA??S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS. WHAT DID YOU THINK OF OBAMA??S SPEECH? I THOUGHT IT WAS HIS BEST ONE YET ALTHOUGH HE CERTAINLY DID BREAK HIS PROMISE ABOUT IT BEING SHORT! I WAS LIKE ??OH GREAT I??LL BE OUT OF HERE IN A HALF-HOUR??? BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT THAT FOR ONCE THE STATE OF THE UNION WASN??T A LAUNDRY LIST. HE MENTIONED EVERYTHING UP FRONT AND THEN IT WAS MUCH MORE THEMATIC A GUY LOOKING BACK WITH PERSPECTIVE AND BREADTH. A LOT OF WHAT HE SAID NEEDED TO BE SAID. IT??S PROBABLY STUFF THAT MADE THE REPUBLICANS MAD LIKE ??THAT WAS THE LESSON OF VIETNAM THAT WAS THE LESSON OF IRAQ.? WELL YEAH THAT WAS THE LESSON OF IRAQ BUT THAT??S WHAT [THE REPUBLICANS] FUCKIN?? HATED BECAUSE THEY HATE TO LEARN LESSONS. WHAT ABOUT NIKKI HALEY??S STATE OF THE UNION RESPONSE? IT SEEMED TO SIGNAL A WIDENING GAP IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY GOING AFTER DONALD TRUMP. WELL COMPARED TO RUBIO AND JINDAL SHE LOOKED LIKE THE LINCOLN-DOUGLAS DEBATES. BY REPUBLICAN STANDARDS I THINK SHE DID OK. AND AS FAR AS HER TAKING A SIDESWIPE AT TRUMP I THOUGHT THAT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE CLEARLY THERE IS A CIVIL WAR BREWING IN THIS PARTY AND IT??S GOING TO HAVE TO COME TO A HEAD. SHE??S GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE ON NOT JUST DONALD TRUMP BUT THE SIXTY-FIVE PERCENT OF REPUBLICANS WHO AGREE WITH HIM ON BANNING MUSLIMS. IF THAT??S WHAT SHE WAS COMPLAINING ABOUT THEN SHE??S GOT A BIGGER FIGHT ON HER HANDS??AS DO ALL THE REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT??THAN JUST DONALD TRUMP. THAT??S THEIR PROBLEM: THEY CREATED THIS MONSTER IN THE PARTY AND NOW IT??S TAKING OVER. THEY DID THE SAME THING WITH THE CHRISTIAN COALITION ALMOST THIRTY YEARS AGO AND NOW THEY??VE REDONE IT WITH THE TEA PARTY. WHAT THEY SHOULD??VE DONE WHEN THE TEA PARTY FIRST EMERGED WAS TO SAY ??YOU??RE YOUR OWN PARTY YOU??RE NOT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS BOB DOLE GEORGE BUSH I. NOT THESE CRANKS.? BUT OF COURSE THEY CAN NEVER RESIST PEOPLE WHO VOTE FOR THEM. AND THE TEA PARTY SEEMED TO BE AT LEAST PARTIALLY BORN OF RACISM AGAINST OBAMA. MORE LIKE TOTALLY. BORN BRED AND RAISED FROM RACISM. OF COURSE. THERE??S A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT PROVE IT BUT OBAMA HAS MOSTLY COMPLETED THEIR AGENDA. HE CUT TAXES ON NINETY-EIGHT PERCENT OF AMERICANS. HE CUT THE DEFICIT BY TWO-THIRDS. HE REDUCED THE SIZE OF GOVERNMENT WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT BUSH AND REAGAN NEVER DID. AND YET THEY STILL HATE HIM. WHAT COULD IT BE? I AM ALWAYS RACKING MY BRAIN! IS IT BECAUSE HE??S SKINNY? WHAT COULD IT BE! THAT??S OF COURSE WHAT IT IS. THERE WAS NO TEA PARTY DURING BUSH DESPITE THE FINANCIAL COLLAPSE THE BAILOUT OF THE BANKS THE BAILOUT OF THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY??ALL OF THIS ??SOCIALIST MONEY? OUT THE WINDOW THE THING THAT THEY SUPPOSEDLY HATE AND YET NO MOVEMENT OF CONCERNED WHITE TAXPAYERS SPROUTING UP. BUT SUDDENLY A MONTH AFTER COUNT CHOCULA TAKES OFFICE THEY BREAK OUT THE THREE-CORNERED HAT! WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE TEA PARTY AND THE BREWING CIVIL WAR WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IT??S A TEA PARTIER??TED CRUZ??WHO??S THE ONE NIPPING AT DONALD TRUMP??S HEELS. TED CRUZ IS SCARIER THAN DONALD TRUMP. BECAUSE I THINK DONALD TRUMP DESPITE SOME OF THE CRAZY THINGS HE SAYS AND SOME OF THE DISGUSTING THING SHE SAYS HE ALSO SAYS SOME THINGS THAT A LIBERAL CAN LOVE. HIS STANCE ON GETTING OUT OF THE MIDDLE EAST AND BEING AGAINST THE IRAQ WAR IS STUFF THAT WAS PRETTY CONSISTENT WITH WHAT OBAMA WAS SAYING LAST NIGHT. AND ALSO TAKING ON HEDGE FUND MANAGERS. IT JUST SHOWS THAT PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY ARE SO OUT OF IT POLITICALLY THAT IDEOLOGY DOESN??T REALLY MATTER ANYMORE. WHEN PUTIN WAS PRAISING TRUMP AND JOE SCARBOROUGH SAID TO HIM ??YOU KNOW PUTIN MURDERS JOURNALISTS? TRUMP??S RESPONSE WAS ??YEAH WE KILL PEOPLE TOO.? THAT??S THE KIND OF THING NOAM CHOMSKY SAYS YOU KNOW? SO LOOK TRUMP WOULD BE A DISASTER AS PRESIDENT DON??T GET ME WRONG BUT I THINK HE COULD ACTUALLY BE TURNED AROUND ON SOME ISSUES. BECAUSE HE??S ALREADY BEEN TURNED AROUND. RIGHT. BEFORE HE WAS A LIBERAL PRACTICALLY. THE BIG ONE FOR ME THAT IS TROUBLING IS SEEING HIM THROW IN WITH THE REPUBLICAN RANK AND FILE ON GLOBAL WARMING BEING A HOAX BUT HE??S VERY EASILY SWAYED BY CELEBRITY. I THINK IF WE SENT LEONARDO DICAPRIO OVER TO TRUMP TOWER ON A SECRET MISSION WE COULD GET HIM TO BELIEVE GLOBAL WARMING IS REAL. BACK TO TED CRUZ. WHY DO YOU FIND HIM SCARIER THAN TRUMP? HE IS CERTAINLY MORE CUNNING THAN HIM AND A FAR MORE EDUCATED GUY WITH PRINCETON HARVARD LAW AND HIS CONSTITUTIONAL LAW BACKGROUND. IT??S HIGH INTELLIGENCE IN THE SERVICE OF EVIL. IT??S ONE THING TO HAVE EVIL PEOPLE WHO AREN??T THAT BRIGHT! THERE??S A REASON WHY EVERYONE HATES TED CRUZ. THERE??S A REASON WHY THE BIG QUESTION ABOUT TED CRUZ IS ALWAYS ??WHEN HE SHAVES IN THE MORNING HOW DOES HE AVOID SPITTING IN THE MIRROR?? TO THINK OF THIS GUY BEING THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES THIS AMBITION AND LOVE OF POWER COMBINED WITH BEING ON THE WRONG SIDE OF EVERY ISSUE IT??S A VERY SCARY PROSPECT. NOW THAT CRUZ IS GAINING IN THE POLLS TRUMP IS FOCUSING ON WHETHER OR NOT CRUZ CAN ACTUALLY BE PRESIDENT SINCE HE WAS BORN IN CANADA. WHETHER OR NOT ANYONE THINKS THE CONSTITUTION SHOULD BE CHANGED IT DOES PLAINLY SAY THAT YOU HAVE TO BE A ??NATURAL-BORN CITIZEN? TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND HE IS NOT. THAT IS WHAT??S IN THE CONSTITUTION. TO ME WHAT??S INTERESTING ABOUT THAT IS THE WAY DONALD TRUMP EVEN THOUGH HE??S NOT A CAREER POLITICIAN SEEMS TO INSTINCTIVELY UNDERSTAND WHAT SO MANY CAREER POLITICIANS HAVE TRAINED FOR YEARS TO LEARN WHICH IS HOW TO DEFEAT AN OPPONENT HOW TO GO AFTER HIS WEAKNESS. LOOK AT WHAT HE??S DOING TO HILLARY [CLINTON] NOW. HE??S TAKEN A PAGE FROM THE KARL ROVE/LEE ATWATER BOOK: FIND THE PERSON??S WEAK POINT??WHICH SOMETIMES CAN BE THEIR STRONG POINT. THEY WENT AFTER JOHN KERRY FOR BEING A WAR HERO AND HE WAS A WAR HERO. SOMEHOW THEY MADE THE DRAFT-DODGER INTO MORE OF A PATRIOT THAN THE GUY WHO WENT TO VIETNAM AND FOUGHT BRAVELY! AND HILLARY??S ACE CARD IS WOMEN AND HE??S TURNING THAT ON HER HEAD BY RELITIGATING MONICA LEWINSKY. WELL IT??S NOT JUST LEWINSKY. HE??S RELITIGATING BILL CLINTON??S ENTIRE SCANDALOUS PAST WITH WOMEN FROM JUANITA BROADDRICK ALL THE WAY UP TO LEWINSKY. SURE. JUANITA BROADDRICK PAULA JONES KATHLEEN WILLEY GENNIFER FLOWERS. AND LET??S NOT FORGET THE [JEFFREY] EPSTEIN PLANE THAT WENT TO ORGY ISLAND! I??M VERY CURIOUS ABOUT WHEN THE JEFFREY EPSTEIN STUFF WILL COME UP BECAUSE EVIDENCE-WISE THAT SEEMS THE MOST DAMNING. YEAH. BECAUSE THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE KINDS OF CIRCLES DONALD TRUMP TRAVELS IN AND KNOWS SOMEONE LIKE THAT. IT??S INTERESTING WHAT HAPPENED WITH THAT BECAUSE IT CAME UP THEN CLINTON PUT THE QUASH ON IT ??YEAH I MET HIM A COUPLE OF TIMES. I WAS ON HIS PLANE. I NEVER SAW ANY UNDERAGE RUSSIAN HOOKERS. MAYBE THEY WERE IN COACH AND I WAS IN FIRST CLASS!??Ÿ NOT EVEN A HOOKER BUT AN ALLEGED ??SEX SLAVE? WHO CLAIMS CLINTON VISITED ??ORGY ISLAND.? RIGHT RIGHT. IF THAT CAME BACK IN A WAY THAT WAS DAMAGING TO BILL CLINTON GOD UNDERAGE RUSSIAN HOOKERS AND SEX SLAVES? CHRIST YOU CAN GET THROUGH A FEW THINGS IN AMERICAN POLITICS BUT NOW WE??RE IN ROMAN POLANSKI TERRITORY. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT HILLARY NOW BERNIE SANDERS IS REALLY RIGHT BEHIND HER. HE??S POLLING AHEAD OF HER IN SEVERAL STATES AND OTHER POLLS CONTEND THAT HE??S POLLING BETTER AGAINST THE GOP CANDIDATES THAN HILLARY??THOUGH THAT NOTION SEEMS MORE THEN A LITTLE FAR-FETCHED. I KNOW YOU SEMI-ENDORSED BERNIE ON THE SHOW SO THE REAL QUESTION IS: CAN BERNIE ACTUALLY BE ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES? THIS IS THE EXACT QUESTION THAT I??M GOING TO BE ASKING THE PANEL THIS WEEK AND IT??S A QUESTION THAT DIDN??T HAVE AS MUCH RELEVANCE UNTIL THIS WEEK NOW THAT HE??S ALMOST EVEN IN THE POLLS. NOW THAT WE ARE PLAINLY SIX MONTHS INTO THE TRUMP ERA??THE ERA WHEN THERE ARE NO MORE RULES IN AMERICAN POLITICS??YOU KIND OF HAVE TO THROW AWAY THE RULE BOOK AND SAY ??WE DON??T KNOW.? IT??S COMPLETELY UNCHARTED TERRITORY. IT??S LIKE THERE ARE TWO ELECTIONS GOING ON: ONE IS BETWEEN THE REPUBLICANS AND THE DEMOCRATS AND ONE IS BETWEEN THE ESTABLISHMENT AND THE ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT. AND I KNOW NATE SILVER AND LOTS OF OTHER PEOPLE SAY IT??S IMPOSSIBLE FOR DONALD TRUMP TO GET ELECTED PRESIDENT BUT AS I??VE ALWAYS SAID: SOMETHING IS IMPOSSIBLE UNTIL IT ISN??T. AND SO FAR DONALD TRUMP HAS DEFIED EVERYBODY??S PREDICTIONS AND HE??S STILL THERE AND HE ONLY SEEMS TO GET STRONGER. THE GUY EATS THIRD RAILS FOR BREAKFAST. I MEAN WHAT WOULD HE HAVE TO SAY? HE??S ALREADY SAID ??CARLY FIORINA YOU??RE TOO UGLY TO BE PRESIDENT! JOHN MCCAIN YOU??RE NOT A WAR HERO! HEY WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE MY IMPRESSION OF A GUY WITH CEREBRAL PALSY?? I MEAN WHAT WOULD HE HAVE TO DO FART IN JESUS?? FACE OR CALL RONALD REAGAN A FAG? I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THIS GUY WOULD HAVE TO DO TO MAKE HIS CROWD TURN ON HIM. HE??S LIKE A MOVIE MONSTER WHO ONLY GETS STRONGER WITH THE STUFF THAT YOU??RE USING TO TRY TO KILL HIM. SO WITH THIS ATMOSPHERE I THINK ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE??AND THAT MEANS BERNIE SANDERS IS POSSIBLE. IT IS PRETTY RICH FOR DONALD TRUMP TO BE GOING AFTER BILL CLINTON FOR HIS NUMEROUS AFFAIRS WHEN DONALD TRUMP WAS REPORTEDLY HAVING SEX WITH MARLA MAPLES WHILE HIS WIFE IVANA AND THEIR THREE CHILDREN WERE AT CHURCH. PEOPLE DON??T THINK OR VOTE LOGICALLY. THEY LIKE TRUMP. HE EXCITES SOMETHING IN THE LIZARD PART OF THEIR BRAIN AND HE KNOWS HOW TO TOUCH A CERTAIN SENSITIVE POINT IN THE KIND OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOTHING LIKE HIM AND HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IN COMMON WITH A BILLIONAIRE. WELL BESIDES HIS TRUMPED-UP ACCENT. YEAH EXACTLY. BUT HE TALKS ABOUT HOW AMERICA DOESN??T WIN ANYMORE AND HOW WE??RE GOING TO BE GREAT AGAIN AND HE HAS HIS PULSE ON PEOPLE THE WAY FEW POLITICIANS BEFORE HIM HAVE. WITH HILLARY WHAT IS GOING ON? BERNIE??S RIGHT AT HER HEELS AND SHE??S GOING ON ELLEN DEGENERES?? SHOW AND DABBING. HER ATTEMPTS AT APPEARING ??HUMAN? AND ENDEARING ARE LAUGHABLY TRANSPARENT. CONNECTING WAS NEVER HER STRONG SUIT. SHE??S A POLICY WONK WHICH IS THE DEMOCRATS?? STRONG SUIT THEY UNDERSTAND GOVERNMENT. THEY??RE SOMETIMES NO PRIZES THEMSELVES BUT COMPARED TO TRUMP AND BEN CARSON THEY DON??T HAVE TO BE TAUGHT THE NAMES OF THE CONTINENTS AND THEY KNOW HOW GOVERNMENT WORKS. LOOK SHE??S TOO CENTRIST FOR ME AND SHE??S TOO IN BED WITH WALL STREET AND MONSANTO BUT SHE??D BE A CAPABLE LEADER. I WOULDN??T BE CONCERNED WITH HER BLOWING THE WORLD UP. ,304124.0

IT IS ALWAYS THE WAY WITH BUBBLES??THE MANIA BUILDS UNTIL THE PRECISE MOMENT A FAINT HISSING SOUND IS HEARD. THEN ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE. INVESTORS START TO STAMPEDE FOR THE EXITS AND COUNT THEMSELVES LUCKY IF THEY CAN GET OUT WITH THE SHIRTS ON THEIR BACKS. THE NEXT BIG BUBBLE TO BURST AN INCREASING NUMBER OF INFORMED VOICES ARE SAYING IS LONDON??S ??SUPER-PRIME?? PROPERTY MARKET THAT IS APARTMENTS WORTH OVER ?2M WHICH ARE OFTEN HOUSED IN GLEAMING NEW APARTMENT BLOCKS THAT MODEL THEMSELVES ON FIVE-STAR HOTELS COMPLETE WITH ??AMENITIES?? SUCH AS WINE CELLARS A CONCIERGE ROOM-SERVICE SCREENING ROOMS DRY-CLEANING SERVICED LAUNDRY HOUSE-KEEPING SQUASH COURTS AND SWIMMING POOLS. LARGE NUMBERS OF THESE FIVE STAR APARTMENTS??ALONG WITH COUNTLESS OTHER GRAND STUCCO-FRONTED TOWN HOUSES IN THE BEST PARTS OF KENSINGTON AND CHELSEA??HAVE BEEN BOUGHT BY BILLIONAIRE FOREIGN OWNERS WHO RATHER THAN LIVE IN THEM SIMPLY USE THE PROPERTIES AS SECURE DUMPS (AND SOME SAY WASHING MACHINES) FOR MONEY THAT THEY WOULD RATHER NOT LEAVE IN A BANK BACK HOME IN GREECE KAZAKHSTAN OR QATAR. THESE ??BUY-TO-LEAVE?? (A PUN ON THE TRADITIONAL BRITISH PROPERTY INVESTMENT MODEL OF BUY-TO-LET OR RENT) PROPERTY OWNERS HAVE CREATED RESIDENTIAL WASTELANDS IN SOME OF LONDON??S POSHEST NEIGHBORHOODS. AFTER DARK IN THE PICTURESQUE STREETS AND COVETED SQUARES AROUND THE KINGS ROAD KENSINGTON HIGH STREET AND EVEN NOTTING HILL IT??S LIKE A GHOST TOWN THESE DAYS. THERE ARE VERY FEW LIGHTS ON IN THE WINDOWS OF MARQUEE BUILDINGS LIKE?ŸONE HYDE PARK AND THE KNIGHTSBRIDGE.?Ÿ NOBODY??S HOME??EXCEPT PERHAPS THE STAFF. ANY FAMILY MEMBERS ACTUALLY STAYING IN THE HOUSES OR FLATS ARE LIKELY TO BE STUDENTS. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT ?8 BILLION-WORTH OF RESIDENTIAL LONDON PROPERTY IS UNUSED AND ??ECONOMICALLY INERT?? AND THE REALITY IS THAT WEALTHY BRITISH FAMILIES DON??T WANT TO LIVE IN KENSINGTON AND CHELSEA ANY MORE. THEY DON??T FEEL LIKE THEY BELONG THERE. THEY HAVE MOVED OUT TO BATTERSEA HAMMERSMITH ACTON AND SHOREDITCH. A NEW REPORT ISSUED THIS WEEK BY LONDON REALTOR?ŸKAY & CO A HIGH-END LONDON ESTATE AGENT CLAIMED THAT THERE ARE NOW SOME 4000 OF THESE LUXURY APARTMENTS 1083 OF WHICH THEY SAY ARE ??5-STAR RATED????MEANING THE BUILDING PROVIDES A CONCIERGE GARDENS A GYM OR SPA A CINEMA A WINE CELLAR AND A SWIMMING POOL??LOCATED ACROSS EIGHT CENTRAL LONDON DISTRICTS. PRICES PAID FOR NEW BUILD APARTMENTS IN PRIME CENTRAL LONDON (PCL TO USE THE BUSINESS JARGON) HAVE INCREASED AT AN ASTONISHING RATE. THE AVERAGE PRICE OF A FIVE-STAR APARTMENT IN PCL HAS MORE THAN TRIPLED FROM ?511000 IN 2009 TO ?2.25 MILLION TODAY KAY & CO SAY. HOWEVER ALL THAT MIGHT BE ABOUT TO CHANGE. UNSURPRISINGLY DEVELOPERS ARE CLAMORING TO BUILD MORE OF THE LUXURIOUS TOWER BLOCKS. AND THEY HAVE FOUND A FRIEND IN THE MAYOR OF LONDON BORIS JOHNSON WHO HAS BEEN BROADLY ACCEPTING OF THE BUY-TO-LEAVE MARKET AND PUSHED SEVERAL CONTROVERSIAL HIGH RISE APARTMENT DEVELOPMENTS THROUGH LONDON??S OFTEN TORTUROUS PLANNING PROCESS. THE RESULT IS PREDICTABLE: A COMING TIDAL WAVE OF OVER-SUPPLY. ROARIE SCARISBRICK OF PROPERTY CONSULTANTS PROPERTY VISION TOLD THE DAILY BEAST THAT AN ESTIMATED 54000 APARTMENTS PRICED AT MORE THAN ?1 MILLION ARE COMING TO MARKET IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS IN PCL??BUT THAT JUST 3900 SIMILARLY PRICED UNITS WERE BOUGHT IN 2014. ??VOLUMES ARE WAY DOWN? HE SAYS. ??WE DRILLED DOWN INTO THE LAND REGISTRY DATA AND WE FOUND THAT THE VOLUME OF SALES OF PROPERTIES PRICED AT ?2M-?3M WERE DOWN 20% PROPERTIES PRICED AT ?3M-?5M WERE DOWN 25% AND VOLUMES OF PROPERTIES OVER ?10M SOLD WERE DOWN 40%. AND 2014 WAS IN SOME WAYS AN ATYPICAL YEAR BECAUSE THERE WAS A GENERAL ELECTION.? INDEED SOME EXPERTS HAVE ARGUED THAT THE THREAT OF A SO-CALLED MANSION TAX WHICH DOMINATED MUCH OF THE ELECTIONEERING IN 2014 MAKES 2013 A MORE VALID YEAR FOR COMPARISON AGAINST WHICH PCL SALES VOLUMES ARE MORE THAN 60% DOWN ACCORDING TO ANOTHER LONDON REAL ESTATE AGENCY DOUGLAS NEWMAN GOOD. THE MANSION TAX DIDN??T HAPPEN AS THE RIGHT-WING CONSERVATIVE PARTY WON THE ELECTION BUT FOREIGN INVESTORS HAVE INSTEAD BEEN SPOOKED BY A NEW PROPERTY TAX REGIME IN THE UK WHICH HAS SEEN A HIGHER 10% ??STAMP DUTY?? TAX NOW APPLIED TO PROPERTIES WORTH OVER ?925000??AND?ŸA 12% RATE SLAPPED ON HOUSES SOLD FOR OVER ?1.5M. THERE IS ALSO A MASSIVE DISCONNECT IN LONDON NOW BETWEEN THE PRICE OF PROPERTY AND THE PRICE OF SHELTER??OR TO PUT IT ANOTHER WAY THE YIELDS AVAILABLE TO INVESTORS. THIS IS A CLASSIC WARNING SIGN OF A BUBBLE AS IT INDICATES THAT BUYERS ARE SIMPLY BUYING THINGS IN THE HOPE THAT THE PRICE SOMEONE ELSE WILL BE PREPARED TO PAY FOR THEIR LOVELY TULIP WILL CONTINUE TO RISE INSTEAD OF REALLY THINKING ABOUT THE FUNDAMENTALS. ASTONISHINGLY SCARISBRICK SAYS SOME OF THE NEW FLASH APARTMENTS COMING ON STREAM IN LONDON IN PLACES LIKE THE REDEVELOPED BATTERSEA POWER STATION COULD YIELD A RETURN OF AS LITTLE AS HALF A PERCENT ON THE CAPITAL INVESTED. EVEN FOR LANDLORDS ACCUSTOMED TO A RETURN OF 3-4% THAT COULD BE A LITTLE HARD TO STOMACH. IT??S EASY ENOUGH TO FIND DISSENTING VOICES IN THE LONDON PROPERTY MARKET. MANY AGENTS WILL TELL YOU THAT THEIR FOREIGN INVESTORS SIMPLY ARE NOT CONCERNED ABOUT YIELDS AND THAT THE CHAOS IN THE OIL AND COMMODITY MARKETS WHILE REDUCING THE AVERAGE OLIGARCH??S NET WEALTH WILL ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE YET MORE INVESTMENT IN THE ??SAFE HAVEN?? OF LONDON PROPERTY. MAYBE THAT??S SO AND THE CREATORS OF SINGAPOREAN AND HONG KONG BANKING FORTUNES WILL CONTINUE TO MERRILY BUY OFF-PLAN FOR YEARS TO COME. BUT TO THE LOCALS LISTENING PERHAPS A LITTLE MORE CAREFULLY THE PCL MARKET IS STARING TO MAKE SOMETHING AWFULLY LIKE A HISSING SOUND. ,10342.0

SOME PHRASES BEING BANDIED ABOUT SUDDENLY INCLUDE ??THE PEOPLE??S DUCHESS?? AND ??THE DUCHESS OF HEARTS.?? THAT MAY BE BEING A TAD OPTIMISTIC. ACCORDING TO A SURVEY LAST YEAR 55 PERCENT OF THE BRITISH PUBLIC BELIEVES CAMILLA SHOULDN??T BE QUEEN IF AND WHEN CHARLES ASCENDS TO THE THRONE. FORTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE WANT CHARLES TO GIVE UP HIS RIGHT TO BE KING FOR HIS SON WILLIAM. THE SAME SURVEY FOUND THAT 38 PERCENT OF THE BRITISH PUBLIC ??DISLIKED? CAMILLA COMPARED TO 34 PERCENT WHO ??LIKED? HER. THIS COULD BE RESIDUAL DISLIKE ON THE PART OF HARDCORE DIANA-WORSHIPPERS OR IT COULD SIGNAL AN ASPECT OF CAMILLA??S PUBLIC IMAGE THAT REMAINS UNCHANGEABLE BY THE BEST PALACE SPIN CHIEFS. SHE QUITE SIMPLY CANNOT AND DOES NOT PLAY THE SAME GLAMOR GAMES AS THE YOUNGER ROYALS SHE IS NOT DIANA SHE IS NOT KATE. WHILE PRINCE CHARLES??S PR TEAM MEMORABLY DID A MASTERFUL EARLY JOB OF INTRODUCING HER INTO BRITISH PUBLIC LIFE??SHE LOOKED GREAT THE NIGHT SHE AND CHARLES WERE SEEN TOGETHER FOR THE FIRST TIME PUBLICLY IN A CAREFULLY CHOREOGRAPHED PHOTO OP AT LONDON??S RITZ HOTEL IN 1999??CAMILLA HAS NOT ACTIVELY SOUGHT PUBLIC ADORATION. SHE HAS AMASSED A SERIES OF CHARITABLE ACTIVITIES THAT SHE CLEARLY??AS WEDNESDAY??S DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ENGAGEMENT SHOWED??FEELS PASSIONATELY ABOUT. SHE AND CHARLES ALSO SEEM HAPPY OR COMPATIBLE. SHE STILL DESPITE THE WARDROBE AND HAIR RESTYLING STILL SEEMS LIKE AN INDEPENDENT WITTY UPPER-MIDDLE-CLASS BRITISH COUNTRY-DWELLER. WHEN SHE AND CHARLES ARE PHOTOGRAPHED IN PUBLIC NOW THE NICE THING IS SHE LOOKS TO BE HAVING A JOLLY GOOD TIME THEY ARE GOOD AT MUGGING TOGETHER SHE APPEARS TO BE A GOOD FOIL FOR HIM. AND ONE SENSES SHE IS FORMIDABLE AND STRONG HERSELF AND PROBABLY NOT GIVEN TO SUFFERING FOOLS GLADLY OR OTHERWISE. SHE ALSO KEEPS HER OWN HOME RAY MILL HOUSE IN WILTSHIRE BOUGHT AFTER HER 1995 DIVORCE FROM ANDREW PARKER BOWLES AS SOMEWHERE SHE CAN ESCAPE TO. THE CHARACTERIZATION OF CAMILLA IN MIKE BARTLETT??S ??FUTURE HISTORY PLAY? KING CHARLES III WHICH IMAGINES THE ABBREVIATED REIGN OF CHARLES SHOULD IT EVER DAWN IMAGINES CAMILLA AS A VITAL COUNTERBALANCE TO HIS BENT FOR INTROSPECTION BUT ALSO A STEELY OPPONENT FOR THOSE WHO WOULD UNDERMINE AND RIDICULE HIM. IF SHE WANTS HIM TO MAINTAIN POWER AND HONOR HIS BIRTHRIGHT THE PLAY SUGGESTS IT IS NOT FOR HER OWN THIRST FOR POWER??BUT FOR DECENCY??S SAKE AND HER HUSBAND??S OWN SANITY SELF-RESPECT AND WELL-BEING. IT IS KATE FASCINATINGLY WHOM BARTLETT IMAGINES AS THE PLAY??S SCHEMING LADY MACBETH. KING CHARLES III IS A WORK OF FICTION (ALBEIT WITH PLAUSIBLE NOTES OF REALITY SKILLFULLY WOVEN INTO IT) AND CAMILLA LIKE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL FAMILY MAINTAINS A STRICT SILENCE OVER MATTERS PERSONAL AND OF WHAT SHE BELIEVES OR NOT. BUT HER PUBLIC PRESENCE AND THE STEADY COMMITMENT TO THE CAUSES HOLDS DEAR SUGGESTS THE KIND OF STRENGTH OF RESOLVE THAT HAS SEEN HER IMPRESSIVELY WEATHER SOMETHING DIANA PRINCESS OF WALES NEVER DID??THOSE YEARS OF BEING CAST AS A VERY PUBLIC VILLAIN. THAT STRENGTH OF RESOLVE SUGGESTS CAMILLA HAS HER OWN SUSTAINING STEELINESS TO FINALLY MARRY THE MAN SHE LOVED AND TO SOMEHOW FACE DOWN VERY DIRECTLY THE PUBLIC OPPROBRIUM THROWN HER WAY. CAMILLA WILL CARRY ON AND BY STEALTH??WHO KNOWS??EVEN IF SHE DOES NOT BECOME THE ??DUCHESS OF HEARTS?? SHE MAY ONE DAY BE A QUEEN THAT THE PUBLIC AT LEAST RESPECTFULLY ACKNOWLEDGES. MAYBE??AND MAYBE SOMETHING MORE. ,21241.0

THE EIGHT-HOUR BBC ADAPTATION COMPLETE WITH HEAVING BOSOMS AND LOTS OF VERY SILLY HATS WILL BE SCREENED IN FOUR TWO-HOUR BLOCKS ON ALL THE A&E CHANNELS (LIFETIME HISTORY A&E). PRODUCED BY THE BBC AND HARVEY WEINSTEIN AND WITH A CAST LIST COMPRISING THE CREAM OF BRITISH ACTING TALENT INCLUDING PAUL DANO (12 YEARS A SLAVE) LILY JAMES (LADY ROSE OF DOWNTON ABBEY FAME) GILLIAN ANDERSON AND JIM BROADBENT (IRIS) THE LAVISH SERIES HAS ALREADY AIRED ITS FIRST TWO HOURS IN THE U.K. TO ECSTATIC REVIEWS. BUT THIS WAR AND PEACE COMES WITH SOME CONTROVERSY: WRITER ANDREW DAVIES??A VETERAN SCREENWRITER WHO AMONG OTHER TRIUMPHS ADAPTED THE ORIGINAL HOUSE OF CARDS NOVELS FOR THE BBC??HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF MERCILESSLY ??SEXING UP? THE PLOT OF LEO TOLSTOY??S 1800-PAGE EPIC ACCOUNT OF THE NAPOLEONIC WARS AND RUSSIAN SOCIETY. MOST SCANDALOUSLY HE??S INCLUDED AN INCESTUOUS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN H??L??NE (TUPPENCE MIDDLETON) AND HER BROTHER ANATOLE (CALLUM TURNER). THEY ARE SEEN IN BED TOGETHER IN THE FIRST FEW MINUTES OF THE NEW ADAPTATION. DAVIES HAS SAID THE INCESTUOUS LIAISON BETWEEN H??L??NE AND ANATOLE KURAGIN IS ??CRUCIAL? TO HIS ADAPTATION AND DENIED THAT HE INVENTED THE RELATIONSHIP. ??BROTHER AND SISTER H??L??NE AND ANATOLE ARE IN AN INCESTUOUS RELATIONSHIP BUT TOLSTOY INDICATES THIS SO SUBTLY THAT MOST READERS INCLUDING ME AT FIRST READING MISS IT ALTOGETHER? HE TODL THE RADIO TIMES. ??THIS RELATIONSHIP AND THEIR ATTITUDE TO IT IS SO CRUCIAL TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THEM THAT FOR ME AT LEAST IT NEEDS TO BE ON SCREEN.? THE DAILY BEAST ASKED SEVERAL PROMINENT SCHOLARS OF THE GREAT RUSSIAN EPIC IF THEY FELT DAVIES WAS JUSTIFIED IN INCLUDING THE PLOTLINE OR IF INDEED THE INCESTUOUS AFFAIR WAS A CASE OF EXTREME DRAMATIC LICENSE. PROFESSOR FAITH WIGZELL EMERITUS PROFESSOR OF RUSSIAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE AT UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON: -BEGIN BLOCK QUOTE- THERE IS SOMETHING IN THE BOOK ABOUT IT BUT IN THE FORM OF RUMOR. AT THE END OF VOL. I PART 2 PIERRE RECOGNIZES THAT THERE IS SOMETHING NOT RIGHT??EVEN NASTY??IN HIS FEELINGS FOR H??L??NE AND RECALLS THAT HE??D BEEN TOLD THAT ANATOLE HAD BEEN IN LOVE WITH HER AND SHE WITH HIM AND THAT WAS WHY ANATOLE WAS SENT AWAY. UNLIKE ANY OF THE OTHER FEMALE CHARACTERS H??L??NE IS NOT HERSELF ATTRACTED TO ANY OF THE MEN AROUND AND DOCILELY DOES WHAT HER FATHER WANTS BY IMPLICATION PERHAPS BECAUSE HER HEART (SUCH AS IT IS) HAS BEEN GIVEN TO HER BROTHER. IN THE BBC ADAPTATION PIERRE DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE MUCH IN THE WAY OF PERCEPTIVE INSIGHTS BUT IS JUST A SOCIAL KLUTZ SO DAVIES HAS MOVED THE INCEST FROM RUMOR TO ACTION. I DON??T MIND TOO MUCH THOUGH I THINK IT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE ANOTHER WAY. HOWEVER I AM HATING THE BBC ADAPTATION LESS THAN I FEARED (IT??S ALWAYS HOPELESS WHEN YOU HAVE TAUGHT A NOVEL FOR 30 YEARS AND YOU SEE IT DRAMATIZED). I??M STILL WATCHING??AND NOT OUT OF MASOCHISM. PROFESSOR CATRIONA KELLY PROFESSOR OF RUSSIAN UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD: -BEGIN BLOCK QUOTE- ANDREW DAVIES ISN??T MAKING IT UP.

NOTE THOUGH THE IMPLICATION IS THAT THE INCESTUOUS RELATIONSHIP IS IN THE PAST NOT THE PRESENT. NATALIA KRYLOVA PH.D. LECTURER OF RUSSIAN LANGUAGE AND CULTURE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA: IN THE ORIGINAL TEXT ANY KIND OF INCESTUOUS RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO OTHERWISE DOUBTLESSLY SINISTER CHARACTERS IS LESS THAN OBVIOUS. WHEN PIERRE RECALLS THE THE RUMORS TO WHICH HE WAS ONCE EXPOSED HE CAN??T PROVIDE A RELIABLE SOURCE OF THIS INFORMATION. GIVEN HOW STARRY-EYED IMAGINATIVE AND IMPRESSIONABLE A PERSON HE IS IT IS NOT QUITE OBVIOUS WHETHER IT IS A FIGMENT OF HIS OWN IMAGINATION OR A SURE FACT. IN ONE LATER EPISODE ANATOLE COMES TO H??L??NE TO BORROW SOME MONEY AND KISSES HER ??NAKED SHOULDERS.? BUT H??L??NE??S ??NAKED SHOULDERS? ARE HER SIGNATURE APPEARANCE TRAIT??REPRESENTATIVE OF HER DRESSING STYLE AND WOMEN??S FASHION OF THE TIME AS WELL AS OF THE PARTICULAR ARCHETYPE OF FEMININITY SHE IS THE EXPLICATION OF (BEAUTIFUL HELEN OF TROY). SECONDLY THE WAYS IN WHICH AFFECTION WAS EXPRESSED (A) IN RUSSIA AND (B) IN THE BEGINNING OF THE 19TH CENTURY WERE STRIKINGLY DIFFERENT FROM THE MODERN WESTERN STANDARDS. I DON??T BELIEVE THAT ANATOLE??S KISSING HIS ADULT SIBLING WAS IN FACT MEANT BY TOLSTOY TO BE A DEMONSTRATION OF HIS CHARACTER??S INCESTUOUS INCLINATIONS. I DO NOT BELONG TO THE CONSERVATIVE COHORT WHO BELIEVES THAT ALL CLASSIC ART IS A SACRED DEPOT OF UNTOUCHABLE ARTIFACTS THAT SHOULD BE LEFT ALONE IN THEIR ORIGINAL / PETRIFIED FORM. BUT I HATE SOME CONTEMPORARY FILM DIRECTORS?? ATTEMPTS TO PLAY ON THE MOST PRIMITIVE INSTINCTS OF THEIR AUDIENCE IN ORDER TO SECURE COMMERCIAL SUCCESS FOR THEIR PRODUCTIONS.

1115,10247958.0,2016-01-25T05:01:00+00:00,CAN BREAKING THE LAW BE A LEGAL DEFENSE?,WHEN OUR GRANDCHILDREN WRITE THE HISTORY OF THE CLIMATE MOVEMENT THEY??LL SAVE A FEW PAGES FOR THE TRIALS OF 2016. FIRST THEY??LL FOCUS ON SNOHOMISH COUNTY WASHINGTON WHERE LAST FRIDAY A GROUP OF SEATTLE-AREA JURORS FOUND THE SO-CALLED DELTA 5 NOT GUILTY OF OBSTRUCTION FOR BLOCKADING A REGIONAL OIL FACILITY IN 2014. THE PROTEST AND THE ACQUITTAL WERE NOTABLE AS PART OF A GROWING WAVE OF ANTI-OIL-GAS-AND-COAL CITIZEN ACTIONS THAT HAS SWEPT THE COUNTRY IN THE PAST FEW YEARS AND THE COURTROOM IN SNOHOMISH COUNTY WAS TREATED TO A MASTER CLASS ON WHY PRINCIPLED LAWBREAKING IS JUST THE TONIC NEEDED TO CURE OUR GOVERNMENT??S WOEFUL INACTION ON WARMING. BUT WHAT LAW STUDENTS OF THE FUTURE WILL LEARN ABOUT THE DELTA 5 TRIAL IS SOMETHING A BIT MORE ARCANE IF NO LESS MOMENTOUS. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE UNITED STATES A JURY HEARD TESTIMONY THAT DEFENDANTS?? CRIMINAL ACTIONS WERE JUSTIFIED BY ??CLIMATE NECESSITY???THAT IS THE ARGUMENT THAT IT??S BETTER TO BREAK THE LAW WHILE GETTING IN A FEW PUNCHES AT THE FOSSIL FUEL SYSTEM THAN TO SIT BACK AND LAWFULLY WATCH THE WORLD BURN. IT??S A DEFENSE THAT??S BEEN TRIED A HANDFUL OF TIMES BUT IN THE U.S. HAS NEVER MADE IT PAST THE JUDGE??S BENCH SLAP. (ONE GROUP OF PROTESTERS USED IT SUCCESSFULLY IN ENGLAND IN 2008.) NEXT ON TO CORTLANDT NEW YORK WHERE THE MONTROSE 9 ARE FACING TRIAL FOR DISORDERLY CONDUCT AFTER HAVING SHUT DOWN A CONSTRUCTION SITE ALONG THE ALGONQUIN GAS PIPELINE IN WESTCHESTER COUNTY IN NOVEMBER 2015. LIKE THEIR BRETHREN ACROSS THE CONTINENT THESE ACTIVISTS HAVE NOT ONLY BROKEN THE RULES TO SAVE THE CLIMATE THEY??VE DONE IT LOUDLY AND PROUDLY. IF ALL GOES WELL AT THEIR NEXT COURT HEARING ON FEBRUARY 3 THEIR TRIAL WILL BE THE SECOND EVER??IN LESS THAN TWO WEEKS??TO AIR THE CLIMATE NECESSITY DEFENSE IN OPEN COURT. THIS IS MUCH MORE THAN JUST LEGAL LA-DI-DA. BY SLIPPING INTO OTHERWISE MUNDANE CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS A HEAVY DOSE OF SERIOUS DISCUSSION REGARDING THE INEPTITUDE OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL CARETAKERS AND REAMS OF NUANCED SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS OF THE CRUDE-OIL CATASTROPHE BREWING IN THE NORTHWEST??JUST ONE OF MANY CAUSES OF CONSTERNATION FOR CLIMATE ACTIVISTS WHO UNDERSTAND THAT THE TIME TO ABANDON CARBON-INTENSIVE ENERGY IS YESTERDAY??THE DELTA 5 (AND THEIR LEGAL TEAM AND ARMIES OF SUPPORTERS) ARE HELPING TO SOUND THE DEATH KNELL FOR THE ??BUSINESS AS USUAL? OF THE FOSSIL FUEL ERA. THE MONTROSE 9 ARE ISSUING A SIMILAR RALLYING CRY TO DEFEAT THE PIPELINE POX CURRENTLY PLAGUING THE NORTHEAST. ADMITTING THAT THEY??VE BROKEN THE LETTER OF THE LAW BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT HAS WHIFFED ON THE BIGGEST CRISIS OF OUR AGE THESE DEFENDANTS SEND A POWERFUL SIGNAL THAT THE CASUAL DESTRUCTION OF THE CLIMATE WILL NO LONGER BE MET WITH COMPLACENCE AND SILENCE. IN A LAST MINUTE LETDOWN IN THE DELTA 5 CASE THE SNOHOMISH COUNTY DISTRICT JUDGE BARRED THE JURY FROM ACTUALLY CONSIDERING THE NECESSITY DEFENSE. THE CAT WAS ALREADY OUT OF THE BAG BY THEN THOUGH AND HAVING AT LEAST HEARD THE FIRST AMERICAN CLIMATE NECESSITY DEFENSE THE JURY ACQUITTED ON THE OBSTRUCTION CHARGE AND CONVICTED ON TRESPASSING. THE DEFENDANTS ARE APPEALING THAT CONVICTION AS WELL AS THE JUDGE??S DENIAL OF THEIR DEFENSE. IN THIS CASE AS IN OTHERS THAT CAME BEFORE IT THE JUDGE DECIDED THAT THERE WERE LOTS OF THINGS ONE SHOULD DO TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE BESIDES ENGAGING IN CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE??AT LEAST UNTIL THE COURTHOUSE IS UNDERWATER PRESUMABLY. THE ACTIVISTS AREN??T BUYING IT. AS A PRE-TRIAL BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF THE WASHINGTON PROTESTERS?? CLIMATE NECESSITY DEFENSE PUT IT: ??THE EXPERT WITNESSES IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE TESTIMONY OF THE DEFENDANTS WILL ?? SPEAK DIRECTLY TO THE QUESTION OF WHETHER ANY REASONABLE LEGAL ALTERNATIVE [TO CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE] EXISTED WITH THE RESOUNDING ANSWER BEING THAT NO IT DID NOT.? NO REASONABLE LEGAL ALTERNATIVE TO ERECTING A TRIPOD OVER OIL TRAIN TRACKS OR BLOCKING THE AUTHORIZED CONSTRUCTION OF A GAS PIPELINE? IT??S A RADICAL ARGUMENT BUT IT??S ONE THAT??S GAINING STEAM IN THE CLIMATE MOVEMENT. THE AMBITIOUS RHETORIC OF THE PARIS CLIMATE TALKS AND OBAMA??S COAL PLAN NOTWITHSTANDING WE??RE STILL WELL ON OUR WAY TO AN UNRECOGNIZABLY UNSTABLE PLANET EVEN AS STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES CONTINUE TO APPROVE AND LAVISHLY FUND OIL GAS AND COAL PROJECTS. (SHOCKING STATISTIC #1: SINCE 2001 WE??VE HAD 15 OF THE 16 WARMEST YEARS ON RECORD. 2015??S AT THE TOP OF THE LIST). THE VERY FACT THAT THE DELTA 5 GOT AWAY WITH ARGUING CLIMATE NECESSITY FOR MOST OF THEIR TRIAL AND THAT THE MONTROSE 9 MIGHT DO THE SAME SUGGESTS THAT THEIR MOVEMENT HAS SHIFTED ITS POLITICAL VISION FROM POLITE LOBBYING AND CONSCIOUSNESS-RAISING TO DELIBERATE AND ELOQUENT DISOBEDIENCE??A SHIFT OF MORAL EMPHASIS THAT PUTS CLIMATE DISSIDENTS IN LINE WITH PRINCIPLED LAWBREAKERS OF THE PAST. BESIDES TRACKING THE RAPID EVOLUTION OF THE CLIMATE MOVEMENT THE DELTA 5 AND MONTROSE 9 TRIALS ALSO SERVE AS PROOF THAT THE PUBLIC AT LARGE IS BREAKING WITH ITS GOVERNMENT AND CORPORATE MASTERS OVER CLIMATE POLITICS. THE DEFENDANTS IN THESE CASES HAVE WAGERED THAT IT??S SMARTER TO BREAK THE LAW FIRST AND ASK FOR PERMISSION LATER??AND THEY THINK THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL BACK THEM UP. (SHOCKING STATISTIC #2: ACCORDING TO THE YALE PROJECT ON CLIMATE CHANGE COMMUNICATION ONE IN EIGHT AMERICANS ARE WILLING TO COMMIT CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE TO FIGHT GLOBAL WARMING). SO FAR THE BET LOOKS GOOD. STAGING DRAMATIC FORMALIZED CLASHES BETWEEN THE CLIMATE VALUES EMBODIED BY THE LAW (FOSSIL FUEL EXTRACTION IS A RIGHT A HEALTHY CLIMATE AIN??T) AND THE CLIMATE VALUES OF THE PUBLIC (RAPIDLY HEADED IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION) CLIMATE DISOBEDIENTS HAVE ALREADY TRANSLATED INTO LEGAL TERMS A MORAL ARGUMENT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNIMAGINABLE 15 YEARS AGO. IN WASHINGTON THAT LEGAL ARGUMENT HALF-WORKED AT TRIAL (NECESSITY DEFENSE DENIED BUT OBSTRUCTION CHARGE TOSSED OUT) AND THERE??S STILL THE HIGH DRAMA OF THE APPEAL AHEAD. THE FIRST SUCCESSFUL CLIMATE NECESSITY DEFENSE MIGHT COME NEXT MONTH IN NEW YORK??AND IF NOT THERE THEN SOMEWHERE ELSE AND SOMETIME SOON. SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT THE TIDE IS SHIFTING. AS IS SO OFTEN THE CASE WITH HIGHLY-TOUTED LEGAL BATTLES AND THEIR SMALL CASTS OF ADVERSARIES WHAT GOES DOWN IN THE COURTROOM IS JUST A SYNECDOCHE FOR MUCH BROADER BUT HARDER-TO-GRASP CONFLICTS IN SOCIETY AT LARGE. CLIMATE NECESSITY DEFENDANTS ARE CONVINCED THAT SAVING THE CLIMATE REQUIRES DRASTIC POLITICAL REFORM BUT THAT SUCH REFORM IS IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT SHATTERING THE ILLUSION OF GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY. TAKE THE DELTA 5. A MOTLEY CREW MADE UP OF A BUSINESS CLIMATE CONSULTANT TEACHER??S ASSISTANT COFFEE HOUSE OWNER RETIRED MUSIC TEACHER AND HOUSE PAINTER THEY??D ALREADY PETITIONED LEGISLATORS SUBMITTED REPORTS TO THEIR STATE DEPARTMENT OF ECOLOGY AND EVEN WRITTEN THE PRESIDENT BEFORE BLOCKING THE BNSF RAIL YARD. IGNORED ON ALL FRONTS THEY DECIDED THAT THEIR ONLY REMAINING OPTION WAS TO RAISE THE TEMPERATURE OF POLITICAL DEBATE. SO THEY SET UP A TRIPOD OVER THE RAILROAD LOCKED THEIR BODIES TO IT AND GOT ARRESTED FOR TRESPASSING AND OBSTRUCTION. THEN THEY TOOK THE BATTLE TO COURT AND TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE JUDICIAL BRANCH??S STUBBORN ATTACHMENT TO NOTIONS LIKE JUSTICE FAIRNESS AND NECESSITY. THE BASIC IDEA: TURN THE CLIMATE CRISIS INTO A MORAL AND SOCIAL CRISIS. COURTS ARE PRACTICALLY THE ONLY PLACE LEFT WHERE THIS SORT OF RIGHTEOUS APPEAL TO THE MASSES IS POSSIBLE. IT DOESN??T TAKE AN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENTIST TO COUNT THE NUMBER OF MAJOR CLIMATE CHANGE BILLS PASSED BY CONGRESS (HINT: FEWER THAN ONE) AND ONE NEED ONLY CONSIDER THE ONGOING OREGON MILITIA SHOWDOWN TO GET AN IDEA OF HOW AGGRESSIVELY OUR GOVERNMENT AGENCIES PROTECT ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES. (INCIDENTALLY THE EFFORT BY THOSE ANTI-FEDERAL ACTIVISTS TO SET UP A SORT OF SHADOW GOVERNMENT BASED ON CITIZEN GRAND JURIES PARALLELS THE APPROACH OF THE CLIMATE NECESSITY DEFENDANTS: RETURN ENVIRONMENTAL POWER TO THE PEOPLE THROUGH THE DEMOCRACY OF THE COURTHOUSE. THE DIFFERENCE? THE TWO GROUPS SEE THIS PATH LEADING TO DIRECTLY OPPOSITE ENDPOINTS: A LOCKEAN FANTASY OF UNPROTECTED PASTURE ON THE ONE HAND OR A POST-CARBON COMMUNITY OF CAREFUL STEWARDS ON THE OTHER. RECENT NATIONAL REACTIONS TO THESE TWO NORTHWESTERN ENVIRONMENTAL SHOWDOWNS SUGGEST THAT THE LATTER VISION??S GOT THE GREATER PULL). TIME TO TURN THEN TO THE LAW WHERE THERE??S AT LEAST A GLIMMER OF HOPE. COURTS HAVE TENDED TO TREAT GLOBAL WARMING LIKE THE PARADIGM-SHATTERING INSTITUTION-SHAKING PHENOMENON THAT IT IS AND HAVE PRUDENTLY ABSOLVED THEMSELVES OF RESPONSIBILITY. AS THE SUPREME COURT WROTE IN 2010 IN AEP V. CONNECTICUT A MAJOR MULTI-STATE LAWSUIT AGAINST CARBON POLLUTERS: ??FEDERAL JUDGES LACK THE SCIENTIFIC ECONOMIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL RESOURCES AN AGENCY CAN UTILIZE IN COPING WITH ISSUES OF THIS ORDER.? ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW FRONT ENVIRONMENTAL LAWYERS?? KNEES ARE SHAKING AS THEY ANTICIPATE THE HIGH COURT??S RULING ON THE LEGALITY OF OBAMA??S CLEAN POWER PLAN. POST-PARIS THERE??S SOME OPTIMISM THAT OUR ESTEEMED JUSTICES WILL GRASP THE DEPTH OF THE WARMING PROBLEM AND THE SHALLOWNESS OF CONGRESS?? ABILITY TO DEAL WITH IT AND GIVE THE STAMP OF APPROVAL. BUT AN ADMONITORY COMMENT FROM JUSTICE SCALIA IN A MAJOR 2014 CLIMATE CASE DEALING WITH THE EPA??S ABILITY TO REGULATE GREENHOUSES GASES????WHEN AN AGENCY CLAIMS TO DISCOVER IN A LONG-EXTANT STATUTE AN UNHERALDED POWER TO REGULATE ??A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY???? WE TYPICALLY GREET ITS ANNOUNCEMENT WITH A MEASURE OF SKEPTICISM???SUGGESTS THAT WE MIGHT NOT SEE OUR GLOBAL WARMING WOES SOLVED WITH THE SNAP OF A JUDICIAL FINGER ANYTIME SOON. SO ATTORNEYS ARE TRYING NEW TACTICS. FOR EXAMPLE A GROUP OF YOUNG PLAINTIFFS RECENTLY SUED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR VIOLATING VARIOUS ALLEGED RIGHTS TO A HEALTHY CLIMATE INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO HAVE THE GOVERNMENT HOLD THE ATMOSPHERE IN TRUST FOR THE PEOPLE. BUT PERHAPS THE MOST PROMISING ROUTE??AT LEAST IN TERMS OF INSPIRING NEW WAVES OF ACTIVISTS AND OF PRESENTING THE CASE FOR CLIMATE JUSTICE IN THE MOST BASIC MOST IRRESISTIBLE TERMS AVAILABLE??LIES WITH THE CLIMATE NECESSITY DEFENSE. NECESSITY DEFENSES HAVE WORKED??IN THE SENSE OF GETTING ACQUITTALS AND GETTING PUBLICITY??FOR NUMEROUS SOCIAL CAUSES IN THE PAST. ANTEBELLUM NEW ENGLAND JURIES ROUTINELY ACQUITTED FUGITIVE SLAVES AND THEIR PROTECTORS. ABBIE HOFFMAN AND JIMMY CARTER??S DAUGHTER AMY SUCCESSFULLY ARGUED POLITICAL NECESSITY AFTER DISRUPTING CIA RECRUITMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS IN 1987. AS A NEW YORK CITY JUDGE WROTE IN 1991 IN ACQUITTING ACTIVISTS WHO HAD BLOCKED THE QUEENSBORO BRIDGE TO PROTEST AIR POLLUTION: ??THE DEFENSE DOES NOT LEGALIZE LAWLESSNESS RATHER IT PERMITS COURTS TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN NECESSARY AND UNNECESSARY ILLEGAL ACTS IN ORDER TO PROVIDE AN ESSENTIAL SAFETY VALVE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY.? ABBY BROCKWAY ONE OF THE DELTA 5 DEFENDANTS ECHOED THOSE SENTIMENTS A FEW DAYS AFTER HER OWN TRIAL DESCRIBING HOW WASHINGTON STATE AGENCIES HAVE FAILED TO DO THEIR JOB WITH REGARD TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND CRUDE OIL: ??THEY??RE JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO APPROVE THE PERMIT ?? THESE AGENCIES ARE ORIGINALLY DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE AND REPRESENT THE PEOPLE BUT THEY??RE NOT??THE INDUSTRY HAS TAKEN THEM.? THE SOLUTION? ??WE DON??T HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO ACTUALLY CHANGE THESE SYSTEMS??SO WE HAVE TO CREATE OUR OWN.? IT??S A PRETTY ASTUTE STRATEGY. TENSION-MAKING AS POLITICAL PRAXIS HAS A LONG DOMESTIC PEDIGREE. A BASIC MOVE OF THE EARLY AMERICAN PATRIOTS WAS TO STAGE CONFRONTATIONS WITH THE BRITISH AUTHORITIES TO FOMENT ANTI-ROYALIST FERVOR (THINK BOSTON TEA PARTY) AND THE CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZERS OF THE ??50S AND ??60S CAREFULLY WOVE TOGETHER MOMENTS OF DRAMATIC DISOBEDIENCE TO PRESENT SITUATIONS OF RACIAL CRISIS THAT COULD BE GRASPED BY THE COMPLACENT AMERICAN MAJORITY (THINK LUNCH COUNTER SIT-INS). IN HIS ??LETTER FROM BIRMINGHAM JAIL? MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. PUT IT THIS WAY: ??JUST AS SOCRATES FELT THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO CREATE A TENSION IN THE MIND SO THAT INDIVIDUALS COULD RISE FROM THE BONDAGE OF MYTHS AND HALF TRUTHS TO THE UNFETTERED REALM OF CREATIVE ANALYSIS AND OBJECTIVE APPRAISAL SO MUST WE SEE THE NEED FOR NONVIOLENT GADFLIES TO CREATE THE KIND OF TENSION IN SOCIETY THAT WILL HELP MEN RISE FROM THE DARK DEPTHS OF PREJUDICE AND RACISM TO THE MAJESTIC HEIGHTS OF UNDERSTANDING AND BROTHERHOOD.? CLIMATE ACTIVISTS BLOCKING FOSSIL FUEL EXPANSION AND SINGING ABOUT A BRIGHTER FUTURE ARE NOTHING IF NOT NONVIOLENT GADFLIES. WITH OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM AT A HISTORICAL NADIR OF DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY THERE ARE FEW OPTIONS FOR DEALING WITH OUR ADDICTION TO FOSSIL FUELS??BUT ONE OF THEM INVOLVES MARCHING STRAIGHT INTO THE COURTHOUSE AND GIVING THE LAW A CHANCE TO SELF-CORRECT. AN ACQUITTAL IN A PROTEST CASE DOESN??T DIRECTLY TRANSLATE INTO EMISSIONS CAPS AND CARBON TAXES OF COURSE. BUT WHEN JURIES WAIVE PUNISHMENT FOR ILLEGAL INTERFERENCE WITH THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRIES THAT MEANS THAT OUR CORRUPT CLIMATE-DESTRUCTIVE POWER STRUCTURE IS STARTING TO CORRODE. SINCE WE CAN??T MAKE CHANGE WITHOUT CHANGING POLICYMAKERS THAT??S A VERY GOOD START. THE YEAR??S JUST BEGUN. MANY MORE ANTI-FOSSIL FUEL ACTIONS ARE IN THE PIPELINE. WITH SUCH AN AUSPICIOUS START ALREADY THERE??S A GOOD CHANCE THAT THIS CHAPTER OF THE HISTORY OF THE CLIMATE MOVEMENT??THE TALE OF RESISTANCE AND RALLYING OF LAWBREAKING AND LIBERATION??WILL HAVE A HAPPY ENDING. TED HAMILTON IS A STUDENT AT HARVARD LAW SCHOOL AND A FREELANCE WRITER. HE HAS WORKED ON THE CLIMATE NECESSITY DEFENSE AS AN INTERN AT THE CIVIL LIBERTIES DEFENSE CENTER AND THE CLIMATE DISOBEDIENCE CENTER AND IS A CO-FOUNDER OF THE CLIMATE DEFENSE PROJECT.

IF YOU CAN??T REMEMBER WELL YOU??RE NOT ALONE BUT YOUR BODY IS DEFINITELY ASKING FOR SOME SERIOUS SNOOZE TIME ?? WHETHER YOU CAN FEEL IT OR NOT. THE AMERICAN SLEEP ASSOCIATION RECOMMENDS EIGHT HOURS OF SLEEP EACH NIGHT AND THOUGH IT VARIES SLIGHTLY FROM PERSON TO PERSON YOU MAY START FEELING THE EFFECTS AS SOON AS YOU DIP BELOW SEVEN-AND-A-HALF HOURS A NIGHT SAYS JAMES MAAS PHD FORMER PROFESSOR AND CHAIR OF PSYCHOLOGY AT CORNELL UNIVERSITY AND AUTHOR OF SLEEP FOR SUCCESS. ??IF YOU??RE NOT WIDE AWAKE AND ALERT ALL DAY LONG FROM THE SLEEP YOU GOT LAST NIGHT? SAYS DR. MAAS THEN YOU??RE SUFFERING FROM SOME DEGREE OF SLEEP DEPRIVATION. (SO YEAH BASICALLY EVERYONE.) AND TRYING TO FIX THE PROBLEM BY ADDING EXTRA HOURS TO YOUR SNOOZE SCHEDULE ON WEEKENDS CAN ACTUALLY DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD BY MESSING WITH YOUR CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS. ??YOUR BODY NEVER KNOWS WHEN TO SHUT DOWN? MAAS EXPLAINS. AS HARD AS IT MAY BE TO PRIORITIZE SLEEP (WORK-LIFE BALANCE IS TOUGH ENOUGH!) JUST TAKING A LOOK AT THE CONSEQUENCES WHEN YOU DON??T GET ENOUGH SLEEP MIGHT CONVINCE YOU TO LOG MORE HOURS IN BED. HERE??S HOW NOT SLEEPING AFFECTS YOUR BODY FROM HEAD TO TOE. 5 WAYS SLEEP DEPRIVATION AFFECTS YOUR MIND AND BODY 1. YOUR BRAIN: IF YOU??RE SLEEP DEPRIVED YOUR MIND SLOWS DOWN. A LOT. BE PREPARED THAT THE QUALITY OF YOUR WORK MAY SLIDE WITHOUT REST. ??THERE??S A REDUCTION IN THE ABILITY TO CONCENTRATE TO MAKE CRITICAL DECISIONS AND PROCESS INFORMATION? SAYS MAAS. ??MEMORY IS ALSO AFFECTED ?? SLEEPY PEOPLE ARE OFTEN FORGETFUL TOO? SAYS DR. NEIL KLINE A REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE AMERICAN SLEEP ASSOCIATION. IT ALSO BECOMES MORE DIFFICULT TO TAKE IN NEW INFORMATION SPEAK OR WRITE WELL AND TO THINK CREATIVELY. ??BASICALLY YOU DON??T HAVE YOUR A-GAME WITH YOU? SAYS MAAS. 2. YOUR MOOD: YOU PROBABLY KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE THAT A LACK OF SLEEP CAUSES MOOD INSTABILITY. (WHO HASN??T BEEN THE OFFICE GROUCH AFTER TOSSING AND TURNING?) SPECIFICALLY IT CAUSES IRRITABILITY AND A LOSS ENTHUSIASM SAYS KLINE. ANXIETY IS ALSO LIKELY TO BE HIGHER AFTER PERIODS OF SLEEP LOSS SAYS MAAS. RELATED: 9 COOL GADGETS TO HELP YOU SLEEP BETTER TONIGHT 3. YOUR APPETITE: ??WHEN YOU??RE SLEEP DEPRIVED YOU OVEREAT? SAYS JOSIANE BROUSSARD PHD RESEARCHER AND ASSISTANT PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO AT BOULDER.

FIRST RESPONSE THE PREGNANCY TEST HAS UPGRADED THE RUN OF THE MILL PEEING-ON-A-STICK-AND-WAITING-IN-ANGUISH-FOR-THREE-MINUTES VARIETY OF HOME TESTING TO A BLUETOOTH-ENABLED VERSION THAT SHARES THE RESULTS TO YOUR PHONE. THE PRODUCT WHICH IS SLATED TO BE IN STORES IN SPRING IS THE FIRST TO BRING THIS TECHNOLOGY TO PREGNANCY TESTS. INSTEAD OF THE USUAL POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE SYMBOLS THE STICK FEATURES A LITTLE SCREEN THAT LETS USERS KNOW IT??S READY TO BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE APP. IT ASKS A FEW PRELIMINARY QUESTIONS??INCLUDING WHETHER THIS IS AN INTENDED PROSPECTIVE PREGNANCY??IN ORDER TO PROVIDE RELEVANT TIPS AND INFORMATION UPON RECEIVING THE RESULT AND ALSO SERVES UP ENTERTAINMENT RELAXATION OR EDUCATION WHILE YOU WAIT. ONCE READY THE STICK GENERATES A SECURITY CODE TO BE ENTERED INTO THE APP AND IF YOU ARE PREGNANT IT FUNCTIONS AS A TRACKER THROUGHOUT THE NINE MONTHS MARKING THINGS LIKE APPOINTMENT REMINDERS AND USEFUL QUESTIONS TO ASK YOUR OB/GYN. RETAILING AT THREE TIMES THE AVERAGE PRICE OF A PREGNANCY TEST IN THE U.S. BEGS THE QUESTION: JUST HOW HIGH-TECH DO WE NEED WHIZZING ON A STICK TO BE? ULTIMATELY THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE PROCESS AND THE TIME IT TAKES TO DELIVER RESULTS ARE THE SAME AND IF ANYTHING INVESTING TIME AND MONEY INTO WORKING ON THOSE ASPECTS OF THE AT-HOME TEST WOULD PROVE MORE DESIRABLE THAN ALTERING THE WAY WE READ THE SIGN AT THE END. ALSO BEING MADE TO TYPE CODES INTO YOUR PHONE WITH SHAKY PEE HANDS? THAT SEEMS LIKE AN UNNECESSARY ADDITIONAL STEP. THE FIRST RESPONSE PRO STICK IS PERFECTLY FINE FOR THOSE WANTING A ONE-STOP SHOP IN WHICH THEY CAN FIND OUT ABOUT AND THEN TRACK THEIR PREGNANCY BUT A $10 TEST FROM CVS AND DOWNLOADING THE APP FOR FREE WORKS JUST AS WELL. LET??S TAKE A LOOK AT THREE OTHER DO-THEY-REALLY-NEED-BLUETOOTH ITEMS. VIBRATOR AH TELEDILDONICS??SURELY ONE OF THE WORST WORDS EVER KNOWN TO HUMANKIND WHICH DESCRIBES THE ROBO-RELIANCE OF OUR FUTURE LIBIDOS: BRINGING SUPER WEIRD TECH INTO THE BEDROOM. IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THESE DAYS ONLY BASIC BITCHES GET THEIR ROCKS OFF FROM SEX TOYS THAT DON??T HAVE BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY SO ADULT PLAY COMPANIES HAVE COME TO THE RESCUE WITH A RANGE OF INTERACTIVE DOWNSTAIRS-STIMULATORS. LOVENSE FOR EXAMPLE OFFERS A SERIES OF SMARTPHONE-ACTIVATED NAUGHTIES THAT CAN BE OPERATED BY YOU OR YOUR PARTNER AT HOME OR AWAY AND ITS APP INCLUDES FEATURES SUCH AS VIDEO CHAT MESSAGING AND MUSIC SYNCING CAPABILITIES. HOT OR JUST PLAIN HORRIFYING? WHO CAN SAY. GLOVES A PRODUCT WHICH DEFINITELY SEEMS LIKE A JOKE BUT APPARENTLY ISN??T ONE ARE BLUETOOTH GLOVES WHICH ALLOW YOU TO ANSWER YOUR CELL BY STICKING OUT YOUR THUMB AND LITTLE FINGER TO MAKE A PHONE SIGN AND THEN SPEAKING INTO THE EMPTY HAND LINGERING AWKWARDLY AT YOUR EAR. ADULT HUMANS DREAMT UP THIS CONCEPT BECAUSE WE??RE NOW ??THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS? WHICH HERE MEANS ??LIVING IN A WORLD WHERE GESTURES WE MADE AS CHILDREN/DRUNKENLY IN BARS WHEN MOUTHING AT HOT DUDES ARE SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE TO DO IN BROAD DAYLIGHT.? PERHAPS THE MOST NONSENSICAL PART OF THIS ALL (AND IT WAS REALLY REALLY TOUGH TO NARROW IT DOWN) IS THAT YOU STILL HAVE TO PRESS THE ANSWER BUTTON ON YOUR PHONE BEFORE THE MICROPHONE AND SPEAKER ON THE GLOVE??S THUMB AND FINGER ACTIVATE. SO YOUR CELL RINGS YOU PRESS TO TAKE THE CALL AND THEN...PUT IT DOWN AND USE YOUR HAND INSTEAD? OH BUT DON??T WORRY IF THAT SOUNDS LEGITIMATELY RIDICULOUS BECAUSE THE MANUFACTURERS HAVE AN ANSWER FOR YOU. ??LET YOUR CHILDHOOD INSTINCTS TAKE OVER...PLUS YOU GET TO LOOK LIKE YOU??RE HAVING AN IMAGINARY CONVERSATION.? DOESN??T SOUND LIKE A RECIPE FOR GETTING INVOLUNTARILY COMMITTED AT ALL. TOOTHBRUSH HAVE YOU EVER WISHED FOR ??REAL-TIME BRUSHING GUIDANCE? AS YOU CLEAN YOUR GNASHERS? NO YOU DON??T NEED TO INVITE YOUR MOM ROUND TO WATCH YOUR TECHNIQUE AND LOUDLY TELL YOU HOW TO DO IT BETTER: ORAL-B HAVE BLUETOOTH-IFIED THEIR LATEST OFFERING TO GIVE YOU THAT BATHROOM PRODUCT CONNECTIVITY YOU NEVER KNEW YOU WANTED. ACCORDING TO THE COMPANY??S WEBSITE ??IT??S NOT BRUSHING. IT??S PERSONALIZED ORAL CARE? WHICH SEEMS LIKE A WAY OF USING MORE WORDS TO SAY THE EXACT SAME THING BUT THERE ARE WE ARE. ITS MAIN SELL IS ITS APP HOOK-UP WHICH CAN TELL YOU IF YOU??RE OVER-BRUSHING CAN BE PROGRAMMED BY YOUR DENTIST AND SOMEWHAT PUZZLINGLY INCLUDES A CALENDAR FOR IMPORTANT EVENTS IN WHICH YOU CAN MOTIVATE YOURSELF TO ??WHITEN YOUR TEETH BY YOUR DEADLINE? BECAUSE THAT IS A THING NOW. 2016 IS THE NIGHTMARE WE DESERVE. ,5173.0

THE SLIMEY D.C. FUNDRAISING CULTURE IS FAMILIAR TO JOLLY. THE ATTORNEY INTERNED ON THE HILL BEFORE HE BECAME ONE OF THOSE MUCH-DECRIED WASHINGTON LOBBYISTS WHERE HE HEDGED HIS BETS AND DONATED TO BOTH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS. JOLLY ALSO SERVED AS CHIEF OF STAFF TO FORMER CONGRESSMAN BILL YOUNG - WHOSE SEAT HE NOW OCCUPIES. YOUNG NOW DECEASED WAS THE LONGEST SERVING REPUBLICAN IN HISTORY AT THE TIME OF HIS DEATH. HE WAS ALSO THE TOP APPROPRIATOR FOR A SLEW OF YEARS AT THE END OF HIS DECADES LONG CAREER JOLLY??S RACE TO REPLACE YOUNG ELECTION ATTRACTED BIG MONEY AS DEMOCRATS LOOKED AT THE PURPLE DISTRICT AS A POTENTIAL PICKUP. BETWEEN HIS PERSONAL FUNDRAISING AND WHAT NATIONAL REPUBLICANS DROPPED HE WAS SENT TO WASHINGTON FOR A COOL $6.3 MILLION .

OR THE MASSACRE OF THE ARMENIANS BY THE TURKS DURING WORLD WAR I.? WYGODA WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE SEEING THIS PARALLEL. THE GERMAN SOCIAL DEMOCRATS IN EXILE REPORTED CONTINUOUSLY ON THE SITUATION IN GERMANY IN THEIR ??GERMANY REPORTS?. IN FEBRUARY 1939 THEY WARNED ??AT THIS MOMENT IN GERMANY THE UNSTOPPABLE EXTERMINATION OF A MINORITY IS TAKING PLACE BY WAY OF THE BRUTAL MEANS OF MURDER OF TORMENT TO THE DEGREE OF ABSURDITY OF PLUNDER OF ASSAULT AND OF STARVATION. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE ARMENIANS DURING THE [WORLD WAR] IN TURKEY IS NOW BEING COMMITTED AGAINST THE JEWS [BUT] SLOWER AND MORE SYSTEMICALLY.??Ÿ WE COULD ALSO MENTION THE FAMOUS GERMAN-JEWISH WRITER FRANZ WERFEL WHO IN 1932/1933 WROTE HIS MOST WELL-KNOWN NOVEL ABOUT THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE HIS FORTY DAYS OF MUSA DAGH MAINLY TO WARN GERMANY ABOUT HITLER. THE BOOK WAS LATER EXTREMELY POPULAR IN THE NAZI-IMPOSED GHETTOS OF EASTERN EUROPE. THERE SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING OBVIOUS CONNECTING BOTH GREAT GENOCIDES OF THE 20TH CENTURY. YET IN ITS HUNDREDTH YEAR THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE IS STILL A PERIPHERAL OBJECT IN THE VIOLENT HISTORY OF THE 20TH CENTURY. MOST OF THE NEW GRAND HISTORIES OF WORLD WAR I MARGINALIZE THE TOPIC IF THEY MENTION IT AT ALL. IT SEEMS AS IF THE TOPIC IS AN EXCLUSIVELY PARTISAN AFFAIR OF THE ARMENIAN DIASPORA AND A FEW CONFUSED OTHERS (LIKE ME). BUT THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY??S DARKEST CENTURY. THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT IT IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE PREHISTORY OF THE HOLOCAUST EVEN IF HISTORY BOOKS SUGGEST THAT THE TWO GENOCIDES WERE SEPARATED BY A GREAT DISTANCE IN TIME AND SPACE. MAINSTREAM HISTORY WRITING HAS NOT ONLY BEEN RELUCTANT TO DISCUSS THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE AT ALL BUT EVEN MORE SO TO EVEN THINK ABOUT THE POSSIBLE CONNECTIONS. THE ALLEGED AND IMAGINED CONTROVERSY OVER THE FACTUALITY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE??OR MORE CORRECTLY THE DENIALIST CAMPAIGN SPONSORED BY TURKEY??HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS IMPRESSION OF A GREAT DISTANCE SEPARATING THIS GENOCIDE FROM THE HOLOCAUST. MANY PROBLEMS SURROUND THE TOPIC AND TURKISH DENIALISM IS BUT ONE OF THEM. CLAIMS TO THE UNIQUENESS OF THE HOLOCAUST AND A LACK OF NAZI SOURCES REFERRING DIRECTLY TO THE ARMENIANS ARE OTHERS. IN FACT THE SENTENCE ATTRIBUTED TO HITLER AND THE MOST FAMOUS NAZI QUOTE ON THE MATTER APPARENTLY EPITOMIZES JUST THAT: ??WHO AFTER ALL SPEAKS TODAY OF THE ANNIHILATION OF THE ARMENIANS?? BUT THIS IS SOMETHING OF A DEAD END IF NOT A DISTRACTION FROM THE DEEPER CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE TWO GENOCIDES. FOR ONE IT IS NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR WHETHER HE SAID IT OR NOT. SOME SOURCES OF THE MEETING HAVE IT OTHERS DON??T (WHICH HOWEVER DOES NOT HAVE TO SIGNIFY THAT HE DID NOT SAY IT). ALSO IT MEANS SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN SOME UNDERSTAND IT. IT IS MORE ABOUT THE FACT THAT NATIONS AT WAR CAN COMMIT HORRIBLE ATROCITIES AND GET AWAY WITH IT. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE AND THE HOLOCAUST IS APPARENT IN TWO PERIODS OF HISTORY. THE FIRST IS THE DEBATE THAT RAGED IN GERMANY REGARDING THE SLAUGHTER OF ARMENIANS BY ITS ALLY THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE IN THE EARLY 1920S. THE DEBATE CAME DOWN IN FAVOR OF GENOCIDE AND BY THE TIME THE NAZIS CAME TO POWER VIOLENCE AGAINST THE ARMENIANS HAD BEEN UNDERSTOOD AND EVEN OUTRIGHT JUSTIFIED ALREADY FOR DECADES. THE SECOND PERIOD IS WHEN THE NAZIS WERE IN POWER AND LOOKED TO THE POST-ETHNIC CLEANSING TURKEY AS A ROLE MODEL. STRANGELY ENOUGH NOT ONLY DOES GERMANY CONNECT THE TWO GENOCIDES IN ITS OWN HISTORY VERY CLOSELY IT IS ALSO GERMANY THAT OFFERS SOME HISTORICAL CLARITY ON THE DEBATE OF WHETHER IT WAS A GENOCIDE OR NOT. IT HAS BEEN CLAIMED THAT INTERWAR GERMANY DID NOT ??COME TO TERMS? WITH THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE AND THAT THIS SOMEHOW MADE THE HOLOCAUST POSSIBLE. HOWEVER THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE: GERMANY NOT ONLY CAME TO TERMS WITH IT BUT PROBABLY HAD THE GREATEST GENOCIDE DEBATE UP TO THAT POINT IN HUMAN HISTORY. IT WAS RATHER THAT THE OUTCOME OF THIS GENOCIDE DEBATE WAS PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC: IT HAD ENDED IN JUSTIFICATIONS OF GENOCIDE AND EVEN WITH CALLS FOR THE EXPULSION OF JEWS FROM GERMANY. AND DESPITE A DRAWN-OUT DEBATE THERE HAD BEEN A MARKED FAILURE TO PRODUCE A DEEPER RELIGIOUS HUMANIST OR PHILOSOPHICAL ANALYSIS APPRECIATION AND CONDEMNATION OF WHAT GENOCIDE MEANT. WHILE MOST OF THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM HAD FOUND SOLACE IN THE FACT THAT THIS HAD BEEN AN ??ASIAN THING? ONLY THE POLITICAL EXTREMES ON BOTH ENDS OF THE SPECTRUM RADICAL SOCIALISTS AND NAZIS REALIZED THAT THIS WAS POTENTIALLY ALSO A ??EUROPEAN THING.? TO UNDERSTAND ALL THIS ONE HAS TO TAKE A LOOK AT GERMANY??S VERY OWN ARMENIAN HISTORY. GERMANY WAS NOT ONLY AN ALLY OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE DURING WORLD WAR I??AT THE TIME THE GENOCIDE WAS COMMITTED??BUT HAD BEEN A QUASI-ALLY AS EARLY AS THE 1890S. AND ALREADY SINCE BISMARCK??S TIMES IT HAD OFTEN ACTED AS THE OTTOMANS?? EUROPEAN SHIELD WHEN IT CAME TO THE ARMENIANS. IN THE 1890S WHEN TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ARMENIANS WERE KILLED IN THE HAMIDIAN MASSACRES (1894-1896) THIS WAS ALSO A ??PROBLEM? FOR GERMANY BUT ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY TO FURTHER INGRATIATE ITSELF WITH THE OTTOMANS (ECONOMIC CONCESSIONS WERE THE IMMEDIATE RESULTS). BUT IT WAS PROBLEMATIC MAINLY VIS-?Ÿ-VIS ITS OWN PUBLIC AT HOME. PRO-ARMENIAN ACTIVISTS AND PAPERS WERE RAISING AWARENESS OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE AND THE PRO-OTTOMAN ELITES WERE DISQUIETED THE RESULT WAS A PROPAGANDA WAR BETWEEN BOTH SIDES WAGED IN THE GERMAN NEWSPAPERS. THE PRO-OTTOMAN (AND ANTI-ARMENIAN) SIDE SEEMED TO BE WINNING BUT THE MASSACRES SIMPLY DID NOT COME TO AN END. DURING THE LAST MASSACRES (IN 1896) A SERIES OF ESSAYS REPORTING ON THE ATROCITIES OF THE LAST YEARS WAS PUBLISHED IN GERMANY AND FOR A MOMENT PRO-ARMENIAN SENTIMENT SEEMED TO HAVE CARRIED THE DAY. BUT THEN MERELY TWO YEARS LATER THE GERMAN EMPEROR WILHELM II TRAVELLED TO ISTANBUL. THIS OBVIOUS SHOW OF FRIENDSHIP WITH THE ??BLOODY? SULTAN NECESSITATED A REVISITING OF THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES IN GERMANY AND PRODUCED DISCOURSES THAT NOT ONLY JUSTIFIED THE VIOLENCE AGAINST THE ARMENIANS BUT ALSO THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT??S SILENCE AND CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR THE OTTOMANS. THE PREEMINENT GERMAN LIBERAL THINKER IMPERIALIST AND PROTESTANT PASTOR FRIEDRICH NAUMANN EVEN WENT ONE STEP FURTHER AND ARGUED FOR AN ETHIC-FREE GERMAN FOREIGN POLICY DEVOTED SOLELY TO NATIONAL SELF-INTEREST. THIS WAS A DYNAMIC THAT WOULD PLAY OUT TWO MORE TIMES IN GERMAN HISTORY DURING THE GENOCIDE AS WELL AS AFTER WORLD WAR I IN A GREAT GERMAN GENOCIDE DEBATE (1919-1923). DURING WORLD WAR I GERMANY NOW OFFICIALLY AN ALLY OF THE OTTOMANS AGAIN ACTED AS A SHIELD FOR VIOLENT OTTOMAN POLICIES VIS-?Ÿ-VIS THE ARMENIANS. HOWEVER NOW THIS VIOLENCE REACHED UNPRECEDENTED GENOCIDAL HEIGHTS. WHILE OFFICIAL GERMANY CONTINUED TO BACK THEIR OTTOMAN ALLY AND EVEN CONTINUED TO SPEW VIOLENT ANTI-ARMENIAN PROPAGANDA AND JUSTIFICATIONS FOR WHATEVER WAS ACTUALLY HAPPENING TO THE ARMENIANS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS GERMANY STARTED TO BECOME ANXIOUS. OFFICIAL GERMANY NOW FEARED THAT WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN ANATOLIA AND MESOPOTAMIA WOULD BE USED AGAINST GERMANY AFTER THE WAR. AND SO ALREADY IN THE SUMMER OF 1919 THE GERMAN FOREIGN OFFICE PUBLISHED A COLLECTION OF DOCUMENTS FROM ITS INTERNAL CORRESPONDENCE ON THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE. IT WAS MEANT TO SHOW THE WORLD THAT GERMANY WAS INNOCENT OF THE CHARGE OF CO-CONSPIRACY IN THE MURDER OF THE ARMENIANS BUT IT INADVERTENTLY KICK-STARTED A GENOCIDE DEBATE IN GERMANY THAT WOULD CONTINUE FOR ALMOST FOUR YEARS. THE PUBLICATION OF THIS DOCUMENTAL RECORD OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE WITH ALL ITS GORY DETAILS PROVOKED AN OUTCRY AND CONDEMNATIONS IN THE LIBERAL AND LEFT PRESS IN GERMANY INCLUDING ATTACKS ON GERMANY??S WARTIME LEADERS. AT THIS POINT LARGE SECTIONS OF THE PRESS ALREADY ACKNOWLEDGED WHAT WE TODAY WOULD TERM ??GENOCIDE? AND WHAT THEY CALLED ??ANNIHILATION OF A NATION? OR ??MURDER OF THE ARMENIAN PEOPLE.? BUT THEN FOLLOWED A LONG YEAR OF BACKLASH IN WHICH NATIONALIST AND FORMERLY PRO-OTTOMAN PAPERS MINIMIZED WHAT HAD HAPPENED FOCUSED ON THE ALLEGED ARMENIAN WARTIME STAB IN THE BACK AND JUSTIFIED WHAT THE YOUNG TURK LEADERSHIP HAD DONE AS ??MILITARY NECESSITIES.? THE DEBATE COULD HAVE ENDED HERE BUT THEN IN MARCH 1921 TAL?T PASHA FORMER OTTOMAN GRAND VIZIER AND MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR AS WELL AS THE WIDELY PERCEIVED AUTHOR OF THE GENOCIDE WAS ASSASSINATED IN A CROWDED BERLIN SHOPPING STREET. THREE MONTHS LATER THE ASSASSIN STOOD TRIAL IN BERLIN AND WAS ACQUITTED BY A JURY ?? THE TRIAL HAD BEEN COMPLETELY TURNED AROUND AND FOCUSED RATHER ON THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE AND TAL?T PASHA??S ROLE IN IT THAN ON THE ACTUAL ASSASSINATION. NOT ONLY SHOCKED BY THE OUTCOME OF THE TRIAL BUT ALSO BY ALL THE EVIDENCE AND TESTIMONY PRODUCED IN THE BERLIN COURT THE GERMAN PRESS AGAIN FOCUSED ON THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE IN DEPTH. DISCUSSING THE TRIAL THE GERMAN PAPERS REPRODUCED A HORRIFYING LITURGY OF GENOCIDAL SUFFERING. NOW THE WHOLE GERMAN PRESS LANDSCAPE INCLUDING THE FORMERLY DENIALIST PAPERS CAME TO ACCEPT THE CHARGE OF ??GENOCIDE? AGAINST THE YOUNG TURK LEADERSHIP. AGAIN THE DEBATE DID NOT COME TO AN END HERE ANOTHER BACKLASH FOLLOWED. NATIONALIST PAPERS AGAIN OFFERED JUSTIFICATIONS BUT NOW FOR WHAT EVEN THEY UNDERSTOOD AS GENOCIDE. AND THIS AFTER THE GERMAN GENOCIDE DEBATE HAD ALREADY GONE ON SINCE 1919 AND AFTER IT HAD INCLUDED ALL THE INGREDIENTS NEEDED FOR A TRUE GENOCIDE DEBATE: DETAILED ELABORATIONS ON THE SCOPE INTENT FOR AND RAMIFICATIONS OF THIS ??MURDER OF A PEOPLE.? AND IT WAS ON THIS NOTE THAT THE DEBATE SIMMERED FOR ANOTHER TWO YEARS UNTIL THE TREATY OF LAUSANNE WAS SIGNED (ESTABLISHING MODERN TURKEY). ALL THIS WOULD PERHAPS NOT BE THAT IMPORTANT HAD GERMANY NOT BEEN MERELY TEN YEARS BEFORE HITLER??S RISE TO POWER: A GENOCIDE DEBATE HAD NOT ONLY TAKEN PLACE BUT HAD ENDED IN JUSTIFICATIONS FOR GENOCIDE. EVEN THEN THE TRUE SALIENCY OF THE TOPIC LAY IN THE RACIAL AND NATIONAL VIEW OF THE ARMENIANS HELD BY MANY OF THE GERMAN COMMENTATORS: THEY WERE SEEN AS THE (TRUE) ??JEWS OF THE ORIENT? EITHER AS EQUIVALENT TO THE JEWS OF EUROPE OR EVEN ??WORSE.? THIS GERMAN ANTI-ARMENIANISM WAS AS OLD AS GERMANY??S TRADITION OF EXCUSING VIOLENCE AGAINST THE ARMENIANS (ESPECIALLY SINCE THE 1890S) AND WAS A CARBON COPY OF MODERN RACIAL ANTI-SEMITISM. IN THIS LOGIC IT HAD BEEN NO SURPRISE THAT IN 1922 WHEN ANOTHER TWO YOUNG TURKS WERE ASSASSINATED IN BERLIN THE NATIONALIST PRESS CONNECTED THE ARMENIAN ASSASSINS TO THE GERMAN JEWISH QUESTION. CONSCIOUSLY CONFUSING THE TWO CATEGORIES THE (HYPER-)NATIONALIST PRESS CALLED FOR AN ??ETHNIC SURGEON? TO CUT OUT WHAT WAS EATING AWAY AT GERMANY??S FLESH. SO WHO WAS STILL TALKING ABOUT THE ARMENIANS IN THE THIRD REICH? SURPRISINGLY ALMOST NOBODY. THE NAZIS WERE REMARKABLY SILENT ON THE TOPIC BUT WERE VERY VOCAL ON WHAT HAD FOLLOWED THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE. THE RISE OF THE NEW TURKEY AND ALL THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF MUSTAFA KEMAL ATAT?¬RK WERE IMPORTANT INGREDIENTS IN THE NAZI POLITICAL IMAGINATION. IN THE GERMAN INTERWAR AND NAZI DISCOURSES ON THE NEW TURKEY ONE FINDS A CHILLING PROPAGATION OF WHAT A POST-GENOCIDAL COUNTRY ONE CLEANSED OF ITS MINORITIES COULD ACHIEVE: TO THE NAZIS THE NEW TURKEY WAS SOMETHING OF A POST-GENOCIDAL WONDERLAND SOMETHING THAT GERMANY WOULD HAVE TO EMULATE. THE NAZIS WERE DISCUSSING THE TURKISH MODEL ALREADY IN THE EARLY 1920S. A GERMAN-JEWISH NEWSPAPER READER AND CRITIC OF ANTI-SEMITISM SIEGFRIED LICHTENSTAEDTER UNDERSTOOD THE ??TURKISH LESSONS? FORMULATED IN NAZI ARTICLES (IN 1923 AND 1924) TO MEAN THAT THE JEWS OF GERMANY AND AUSTRIA SHOULD BE AND HAD TO BE KILLED AND THEIR PROPERTY GIVEN TO ??ARYANS.? HE WROTE THIS IN HIS 1926 BOOK ANTI-SEMITICA. IN THE END IT DOES NOT MATTER HOW IMPORTANT WE FIND THE POSSIBLE INFLUENCES EXERTED FROM THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE ON THE NAZIS??THEY SURELY DID NOT NEED TO LEARN THEIR MURDEROUS BUSINESS FROM OTHERS. WHAT THEY DID LEARN WAS THAT THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE EVEN IN AN OPEN PLURALISTIC SOCIETY WHO WOULD IGNORE RATIONALIZE OR EVEN OUTRIGHT JUSTIFY GENOCIDAL VIOLENCE. EVEN THE CHURCHES DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY INTERVENE FOR FELLOW CHRISTIANS. TO PARAPHRASE THE IMPRESSION OF A JEWISH READER OF WERFEL??S BOOK IN THE GHETTOS DURING WORLD WAR II: IF NOBODY WOULD SAVE CHRISTIANS WHO WOULD INTERVENE FOR THE JEWS? AND IF GERMAN NATIONALISTS COULD FIND IT IN THEMSELVES TO JUSTIFY THE GENOCIDE OF CHRISTIANS AND WERE NOT MET WITH MUCH OPPOSITION IN THE GERMAN PUBLIC WHO WOULD SPEAK OUT FOR THE JEWS? THERE ARE NO EASY AND AUTOMATIC CASUAL CONNECTIONS FROM ONE GENOCIDE TO THE NEXT BUT THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE AND ITS CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE HOLOCAUST ILLUSTRATE THE IMPORTANCE AND THE PITFALLS OF HOW WE COME TO TERMS WITH THE PAST. THEY ALSO ILLUSTRATE THAT WE ARE FAR FROM DONE WITH STRUGGLING TO UNDERSTAND THE TRAGIC 20TH CENTURY. THIS IS WHY THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE FINALLY NEEDS TO TAKE ITS PLACE AND BE ALLOWED TO TAKE ITS PLACE IN THE BLOODY HISTORY OF THE 20TH CENTURY NOT ONLY GENERALLY IN WORLD HISTORY BUT SPECIFICALLY IN EUROPEAN AND GERMAN HISTORY.

IT IS A MUSICAL COMEDY NOT IN THE GLEE SENSE BUT IN THE AUTHENTIC AND AS BLOOM NOTES ??PATRIOTIC? SENSE: IN TRUE ASTAIRE-AND-ROGERS STYLE THE CHARACTERS BREAK OUT INTO ORIGINAL SONG-AND-DANCE NUMBERS WHEN WORDS ALONE WILL NO LONGER DO. SURE THAT GENRE HAS ROOTS ACROSS THE POND BUT IT WAS PERFECTED ON CELLULOID HERE BEFORE BEING ALL BUT BANISHED BACK TO BROADWAY. DURING OUR SIT-DOWN WHICH WAS CONDENSED AND EDITED FOR SPACE BLOOM WAXES PASSIONATE ABOUT BRINGING THE MUSICAL BACK TO THE SCREEN HOWEVER SMALL AND ABOUT SO MANY OTHER THINGS: HER FANS ONSCREEN DIVERSITY THE POSSIBILITY OF A SECOND SEASON AND OF COURSE THE PIZZA. IN YOUR?ŸACCEPTANCE SPEECH YOU TALKED ABOUT THE REJECTION YOU FACED SHOPPING CRAZY-EX AROUND TO DIFFERENT NETWORKS. WAS IT FRUSTRATING TO HAVE SOMETHING SO UNIQUE AND WEIRD ON YOUR HANDS BUT TO HAVE TROUBLE SELLING IT? IT WAS REALLY FRUSTRATING BECAUSE WE KNEW WE HAD CREATED SOMETHING GOOD AND ALL OF THE REJECTIONS WERE DIFFERENT. SOME PLACES JUST SAY ??IT??S NOT FOR US? WHICH AT THE END OF THE DAY NETWORKS HAVE THEIR OWN AGENDAS SO IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU. BUT ONE PLACE SAID ??OH WE THOUGHT IT??D BE EDGIER.? NOW IN THE ORIGINAL PILOT I GIVE GREG [SANTINO FONTANA] A HAND JOB I WAX MY ASSHOLE. I DON??T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY FUCKING ??EDGIER.? AND I THINK WHAT THEY MEANT WAS THAT IT??S ULTIMATELY AN OPTIMISTIC SHOW [LEANS OVER MY VOICE RECORDER]??OH WOW!

OH IT??S REALLY HOT I??LL LET IT COOL OFF??SO IT WAS FRUSTRATING ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HEAR THAT IT??S NOT EDGY ENOUGH OR ??OH WE WISH YOU WERE YOUNGER.? YOUNGER? AREN??T YOU 28? THAT??S THE OTHER THING. I TALKED ABOUT REJECTION BUT I??M THE MOST FORTUNATE FUCKING PERSON IN THE WORLD. I HAVE MY OWN SHOW AT 28 AND A GOLDEN GLOBE. SO YES I FACE REJECTION BUT I??VE ALSO BEEN VERY FORTUNATE AND UNDERSTAND HOW FORTUNATE I AM. MANY CREATORS OF TV MUSICAL COMEDIES FIND A WAY TO REPURPOSE THEIR OLD MATERIAL BUT NONE OF YOUR YOUTUBE SONGS HAVE SHOWN UP IN CRAZY EX SO FAR. WHEN DID YOU DECIDE TO GO ALL NEW? ALWAYS. WE??VE TRIED TO OCCASIONALLY REPURPOSE STUFF AND THAT RARELY WORKS. WE??RE DOING A MUSICAL TELEVISION SHOW??IT??S THE KIND OF THING I??VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO??WHERE THE MUSIC IS BOTH FUNNY BUT ALSO REALLY DOES FURTHER THE PLOT AND COMES FROM CHARACTER. THE DEFINITION OF A MUSICAL IS THAT THE EMOTION IS SO STRONG THAT YOU CAN??T TALK ANYMORE YOU HAVE TO SING. THE EMOTION ISN??T STRONG ENOUGH WHEN YOU??RE JUST LIKE ??LET??S TAKE A SECOND TO SING ABOUT LAMPS!? IT HAS TO COME FROM THE EMOTION FOR OUR SHOW BECAUSE REBECCA??S EMOTIONAL STATE IS SO HEIGHTENED AND THERE??S SO MUCH JUICY EMOTIONAL STUFF TO MINE. IT WOULD HAVE TO BE SUCH AN ASIDE. IF YOU WERE TO TRY IT WITH ??FUCK ME RAY BRADBURY? THE WHOLE STORY WOULD HAVE TO BE ABOUT WANTING TO MEET RAY BRADBURY. THAT BEING SAID DO YOU FEEL PRESSURE GIVEN THE WAY TELEVISION IS PROMOTED ONLINE TO PRODUCE SONGS THAT WORK BOTH IN THE NARRATIVE AND AS STANDALONE VIRAL VIDEOS? A HUNDRED PERCENT. YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT HASN??T WORKED. ??SEXY GETTING READY SONG? HAS GONE VIRAL BUT SHORT OF THAT NO OTHER SONG FROM OUR SHOW HAS GONE VIRAL. I THINK OUR SONGS ARE AWESOME AND SOME OF THE VIDEOS ARE SUCCESSFUL BUT YOU CAN??T REALLY CONTROL WHAT GOES VIRAL. ALL I CAN DO IS MAKE VIDEOS THAT ARE FUNNY AND THAT CAN ALSO BE POIGNANT BUT IF THE GOAL IS TO GO VIRAL YOU??LL GO CRAZY. YOU SEEM TO HAVE A REALLY DEEP COMMITMENT TO THE GENRE OF THE MUSICAL?? I LOVE MUSICAL THEATER SO MUCH. WHEN DONE RIGHT I THINK COMEDY SONGS CAN BE THE MOST EFFICIENT FORM OF JOKE DELIVERY. SONGS CAN BE THE MOST EFFICIENT AND THE BEST FORMS OF CONVEYING EMOTION. MUSIC IS UNIVERSAL. IT??S WORLDWIDE. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE FORGET OR DON??T KNOW THAT THE MODERN MUSICAL IS AN AMERICAN ART FORM. IT STARTED AS OPERETTA IN EUROPE BUT??GERSHWIN JEROME KERN IRVING BERLIN GEORGE M. COHAN RODGERS AND HAMMERSTEIN??IT??S AN AMERICAN ART FORM AND IF YOU SUPPORT MUSICAL THEATER IT??S PATRIOTIC. IF I HAD TIME TO SAY THAT IN THE [GOLDEN GLOBES] SPEECH I WOULD HAVE SAID ??THE AMERICAN MUSICAL IS ALIVE AND WELL. ONE OF THE PLACES IT LIVES IS NETWORK TELEVISION.? I HAVE SUCH PRIDE IN FURTHERING THE AMERICAN MUSICAL AND USING IT AS A WAY TO TELL STORY. THE FIRST MUSICAL YOU EVER SAW? GUYS AND DOLLS. I SAW IT WHEN I WAS FIVE IN A COMMUNITY THEATER PRODUCTION. IT WAS AMAZING. THE THING THAT STRIKES ME THE MOST ABOUT YOU AS A PERFORMER IS HOW MUCH ENERGY YOU HAVE WHETHER IT??S ON THE SHOW ITSELF OR BACKSTAGE SINGING AN IMPROMPTU TUNE ABOUT?ŸTWEETING AT TONY SHALHOUB. WHERE DO YOU GET IT? A LOT OF IT STEMS FROM FEAR OF DEATH AND FEAR OF FAILURE AND FEAR OF LOOKING BACK AND BEING LIKE ??I COULD HAVE TWEETED MORE. I COULD HAVE DONE THIS MORE.? I??M HAVING THE TIME OF MY LIFE. I GET TO MAKE A MUSICAL TELEVISION SHOW. BUT ULTIMATELY IT??S FEAR OF NOT USING EVERY OPPORTUNITY NOT CARPE-ING THAT DIEM NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE MOMENT. I ALSO LOVE IT. I??M HAVING SO MUCH FUN. AND I??M ALSO DEVOURING THIS PIZZA AND I??M HAVING SO MUCH FUN DEVOURING IT. AND YOU HAVE A GOLDEN GLOBE?? THAT STILL HASN??T REALLY HIT ME. DID IT CROSS YOUR MIND THAT IT COULD WIN? YOU WERE A FAVORITE TO WIN. SO IT WAS LIKE [SHRUGS] ??EH? AND THEN A COUPLE DAYS BEFORE I THOUGHT I MIGHT WIN. IT CROSSED MY MIND. I WROTE A SPEECH THAT I PROMPTLY THREW AWAY WHEN I ACTUALLY WON. AND THEN ROLLING STONE SAID I WAS THE FRONTRUNNER. THAT??S WHEN MY CO-CREATOR WAS LIKE ??RACHEL YOU MIGHT WIN? WHAT??S YOUR SPEECH ABOUT?? AND THEN I STARTED TO BECOME THE FRONTRUNNER AT ALL THESE OTHER PUBLICATIONS LITERALLY TWO DAYS BEFORE. THAT WAS WHEN I WAS LIKE ??OH FUCK. I MIGHT LIKE FUCKING WIN THIS THING.? YOU SPENT YOUR ENTIRE SPEECH THANKING PEOPLE WHICH IS SOMETHING YOU??RE ALWAYS DOING WITH FANS ON SOCIAL MEDIA. NOW THAT YOU??VE GOT THE GLOBE WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO START ACTING UNTOUCHABLE? WHEN WE??RE A RATINGS HIT. [LAUGHS] I??M SO GRATEFUL TO FANS. I OWE MY CAREER TO FANS. IT??S HURTFUL TO BE MAKING A SHOW THAT IS CRITICALLY ACCLAIMED BUT BECAUSE WE HAPPEN TO BE ON A BROADCAST NETWORK OUR RATINGS ARE UNDER SO MUCH SCRUTINY. YOU KNOW IT??S HURTFUL TO GO ON?ŸTV BY THE NUMBERS AND SEE ??LIKELY TO BE CANCELED.? I KNOW THAT??S BASED ON NUMBERS BUT LIKE FUCK OFF. THAT??S NOT HOW THE CW MAKES US FEEL BUT WHEN YOU??RE ON A NETWORK THE RATINGS ARE SO IMPORTANT. SO ANYONE I MEET WHO SAYS ??I LOVE YOUR SHOW? I??M LIKE ??OH MY GOSH! THANK YOU!? I GET STARSTRUCK WHEN I MEET FANS. I??M CHECKING THOSE SAME SITES WITH MY FINGERS CROSSED?? HERE??S THE THING: I THINK THIS GLOBE WIN MEANS OUR SECOND SEASON. I??D BE SHOCKED IF WE DIDN??T GET A SECOND SEASON. THERE??S A HUGE CONVERSATION ABOUT DIVERSITY AND?ŸFEMINISM AROUND YOUR SHOW ESPECIALLY WITH JOSH BEING FILIPINO-AMERICAN. WATCHING IT THOUGH IT JUST FEELS REAL. HOW MUCH OF THE CONVERSATION AROUND DIVERSITY ON TELEVISION IS ACTUALLY ABOUT REPRESENTING?? ?? THINGS AS THEY ARE? JOSH CHAN [RODRIGUEZ III] WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE AN ASIAN BRO. ALWAYS. THE REASON WE PICKED THAT WASN??T BECAUSE ??OH ASIANS NEED TO BE REPRESENTED MORE ON TV! HOW DO WE HELP THAT?? THAT WAS A PLUS! WE WERE THINKING ??WHAT HASN??T BEEN DONE BEFORE? WHAT??S A NEW STORY WE CAN TELL? WHAT??S A NEW TYPE OF CHARACTER?? WE??VE SEEN THE BRO. WE HAVEN??T SEEN AN ASIAN BRO. I REALLY THINK DIVERSITY IS SIMULTANEOUS WITH TELLING NEW STORIES BECAUSE I DON??T KNOW ??WHITE PEOPLE HANGING OUT IN A COFFEE SHOP? HAS BEEN DONE. DIVERSITY IS JUST MORE ARTISTICALLY INTERESTING TO ME BECAUSE YOU??RE IN NEW TERRITORY AND THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF MAKING ART IN MY HEAD IS TO EXPLORE TOPICS THAT HAVEN??T BEEN EXPLORED. I HAVE NEVER SEEN A SHOW THAT TOOK PLACE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND PORTRAYED PEOPLE THE WAY IT IS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE PROM KING IN MY HIGH SCHOOL WAS CHINESE AND THE PROM QUEEN WAS JAPANESE. WE JUST DIDN??T THINK ABOUT IT. IT WAS LIKE ??OH YEAH GEORGE AND MIKA? THEY??RE THE PROM KING AND QUEEN.? IT WASN??T UNTIL I REALIZED THAT EVERY OTHER SHOW IS SET IN SOME NEBULOUS TOWN ON THE EAST COAST OR MIDWEST WHERE EVERYONE IS WHITE AND PROTESTANT?? HOW BORING IS THAT? AND THAT??S NOT TRUTH. THAT??S NOT MY TRUTH. I REMEMBER AS A KID LIVING IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND EVERY TV SHOW WAS SET IN THAT TYPICAL EAST COAST HIGH SCHOOL. AND I REMEMBER SEEING A HIGH SCHOOL NEAR ME THAT LOOKED LIKE THAT AND THINKING ??OH A REAL HIGH SCHOOL!? THAT??S NOT FEELING MARGINALIZED. NOW IF I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT ABOUT LIKE THE WAY MY SCHOOL LOOKED IMAGINE BEING A FILIPINO PERSON WHO??S LIKE ??I??M NOT A REAL AMERICAN BECAUSE I??M NOT ON TV.? WE??RE A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS. THAT??S WHAT BEING AN AMERICAN IS. ONE OF THE DIVERSE STORIES YOU??RE TELLING IS ABOUT YOUR CHARACTER??S STRUGGLES WITH MENTAL ILLNESS WHICH SEEMS LIKE A DIFFICULT TOPIC FOR A COMEDY TO APPROACH?? ??WHICH IS SO FUNNY BECAUSE EVERY COMEDIAN I KNOW IS ON ANTIDEPRESSANTS AND HAS A VERY DARK SENSE OF HUMOR. IT ALWAYS TAKES A WHILE I THINK FOR TV AND FILM TO CATCH UP WITH WHAT??S ALREADY BEING DONE IN THE ALTERNATIVE COMEDY WORLD. EVERY FRIEND I KNOW WE ALL HAVE DARK SENSES OF HUMOR ABOUT OUR DEPRESSION OUR ANXIETY OUR FAMILY ISSUES. I GUESS WHAT??S GROUNDBREAKING IS DOING IT ON NETWORK TELEVISION. BUT TO ME I??VE BEEN JOKING WITH MY FRIENDS ABOUT THIS SHIT FOR YEARS. AND I THINK THAT WHAT IT IS [NEW] IS TRUTH AND IT??S HONESTY AND IT??S NOT LABELING IT AS AN OTHER. IT MAKES FOR TRICKY VIEWING THOUGH BECAUSE YOU WANT REBECCA TO GROW AS A PERSON BUT IF YOU RELATE TO HER YOU ALSO WANT HER TO GET WHAT SHE WANTS EVEN WHEN IT??S NOT RIGHT FOR HER. IT??S FUNNY YOU SAY THAT BECAUSE IT??S THE STRUGGLE THAT WE HAVE. LOOK ULTIMATELY WHEN REBECCA??S CURED AS A PERSON THE SHOW??S OVER. THE SHOW??S ABOUT SOMEONE IN CRISIS AND IF SHE??S LEARNING SHE??S LEARNING VERY SLOWLY. AND IF WE GET A SECOND SEASON SHE??LL BE LEARNING VEEEEERY SLOWLY IF AT ALL. SO IT??S THAT STRUGGLE BETWEEN HAPPINESS THAT CAN LAST VERSUS HAPPINESS THAT CAN GO AWAY. YOU SHARE INITIALS WITH REBECCA BUNCH. HOW MUCH OF THE CHARACTER IS YOU? HER LIFE IS ON THE SURFACE VERY DIFFERENT FROM MINE. I WOULD SAY THAT IT??S EMOTIONALLY AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL LIKE 70 PERCENT. AS FAR AS THE ACTUAL DETAILS OF HER LIFE: 20 PERCENT. IT??S LIKE ME IF I NEVER PURSUED THEATER OR ART??I??D BE MISERABLE. """,15685.0

NOR IS IT A CHOICE BETWEEN EXTREMISTS AND CENTRISTS (OR ??PRIMARY EXTREMISTS? WHO WILL MAGICALLY TRANSFORM INTO CENTRISTS EVEN BEFORE THE LAST CONVENTION BALLOON HAS POPPED). BOTH THE REPUBLICANS AND THE DEMOCRATS HAVE HAD THEIR DALLIANCES WITH RELATIVELY EXTREME IDEOLOGICAL NOMINEES IN THE PAST. THEY HAVE NOT FARED WELL IN THE GENERAL ELECTION. BARRY GOLDWATER MAY HAVE LAID THE GROUND FOR THE REAGAN REVOLUTION IN 1964 BUT HE WAS BATTERED BY LYNDON JOHNSON. GEORGE MCGOVERN MIGHT NOT HAVE LOOKED SO BAD IN HINDSIGHT AFTER RICHARD NIXON MET HIS WATERGATE BUT THAT DOESN??T CHANGE THE FACT THAT HE MADE NIXON LOOK LIKE NAPOLEON IN THE 1972 LANDSLIDE. NEXT YEAR??S ELECTION COULD LOOK SIMILAR IF DONALD TRUMP OR TED CRUZ COME OUT OF THE GOP PRIMARY TO GIFT-WRAP THE ELECTION FOR HILLARY CLINTON. THE TEA PARTY REMNANTS EVANGELICALS AND OTHER GROUPS WHO APPEAR TO HOLD SO MUCH SWAY IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY ARE NOT A BIG ENOUGH BASE FOR A CANDIDATE WHO HAS OFFENDED NEARLY EVERY OTHER GROUP IN AMERICA. OR 2016 COULD ENTER UNCHARTED TERRITORY IF BERNIE SANDERS STICKS AROUND LONG ENOUGH TO PULL HILLARY EVEN FURTHER TO THE LEFT. SHE??S NO IDEOLOGUE BUT THE MORE THE DEMOCRATS FOLLOW SANDERS DOWN THE SOCIALIST PATH THE MORE WE HAVE TO WONDER WHAT IT WILL BE LIKE TO HAVE A GOLDWATER VERSUS A MCGOVERN ELECTION WITH NO SANE CENTER IN SIGHT. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE GOP IS NATIONALIST THE DEMS ARE SOCIALIST AND TRUMP IS NATIONAL SOCIALIST? I??M SURE I??M NOT ALONE IN NOT WANTING TO FIND OUT. THIS RISK IS EVEN GREATER IN FOREIGN POLICY. CLINTON HAS ESSENTIALLY ENDORSED PRESIDENT OBAMA??S PLAY-ACTING POLICY AS BEFITS HIS FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE. THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE SEES THE ISLAMIC STATE AS A COMMUNICATIONS PROBLEM THAT WOULD GO AWAY IF ONLY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WOULD AGREE THAT THE WHITE HOUSE IS DOING A GREAT JOB??DESPITE 75% OF AMERICANS SAYING THE BATTLE AGAINST TERROR IS NOT GOING WELL. MEANWHILE OBAMA AND JOHN KERRY CONTINUE TO INSIST THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN CAN BE AN ALLY AN IDEA THAT WAS NA??VE SEVEN YEARS AGO FOOLISH FOUR YEARS AGO AND CAN??T BE CALLED ANYTHING LESS THAN INSANE OR SUICIDAL AT THIS POINT. WITH SECURITY NOW THE TOP ISSUE FOR MOST AMERICANS IT??S AWKWARD FOR HILLARY TO DENOUNCE THE DO-NOTHING OBAMA POLICY THAT HAS LED THIS TO BE THE CASE SINCE SHE WAS ONE OF ITS ARCHITECTS. COMING TO RESCUE CLINTON FROM THIS DILEMMA IS A NEW BREED OF GOP NEO-AMERICA FIRST NATIONALIST/ISOLATIONISTS WHOSE TENETS SEEM TO BE THAT 1) AMERICA IS GOD??S CHOSEN NATION AND 2) THE REST OF THE WORLD CAN GO TO HELL. THIS IS DUBIOUS THEOLOGY AT BEST AND THE FACT THAT AMERICA WON??T BE IN GOOD SHAPE FOR LONG IF THE REST OF THE WORLD IS IN FLAMES SHOULD BE OBVIOUS. THE CRUZ-TRUMP LINE THAT THE UNITED STATES CAN PROSPER WHILE HIDING BETWEEN TWO OCEANS AND OCCASIONALLY CARPET-BOMBING A FAR-OFF LAND IS PREPOSTEROUS AS WELL AS MORALLY REPUGNANT. THE AMERICA FIRSTERS WHO WANTED TO KEEP AMERICA OUT OF WORLD WAR II HAD A FIRST PRINCIPLE THAT SAID ??NO FOREIGN POWER NOR GROUP OF POWERS CAN SUCCESSFULLY ATTACK A PREPARED AMERICA.? THAT WAS QUICKLY REFUTED BY PEARL HARBOR (IMMEDIATELY AFTER WHICH THE AMERICA FIRST COMMITTEE DISBANDED) AND HAS BEEN DISPROVED EVEN MORE EMPHATICALLY BY THE 9/11 ATTACKS AND THE SPATE OF FOREIGN AND HOMEGROWN TERROR ATTACKS IN RECENT MONTHS. PLAYING DEFENSE HASN??T WORKED SINCE 1941 AND THANKS LARGELY TO TECHNOLOGY ATTACKS ARE ONLY GETTING EASIER. THE ISOLATIONISTS ALSO IGNORE THE FACT THAT GLOBALIZED ECONOMIES HAVE GLOBAL INTERESTS AND THAT STABILITY IS ESSENTIAL FOR GLOBAL TRADE. UNLESS THE U.S. IS PREPARED TO ROLL BACK THE COUNTLESS BENEFITS ITS COMPANIES AND CITIZENS REAP FROM CHEAP ENERGY AND GLOBAL MARKETS FOR AMERICAN PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WALKING AWAY AS THE CHAOS GROWS IS SELF-DESTRUCTIVE IN THE EXTREME. TO BE FAIR DONALD TRUMP ISN??T EXACTLY ISOLATIONIST IN THE WAY CRUZ AND RAND PAUL ARE. IF IT??S POSSIBLE TO GLEAN ANYTHING FROM TRUMP??S INCOHERENT STATEMENTS ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS IT??S THAT HE FAVORS BOMBING TERRORISTS WHILE PARTNERING WITH THOSE WHO SPONSOR AND PROTECT THOSE SAME TERRORISTS. IF THIS SOUNDS LIKE JUST ANOTHER OUTRAGEOUS TRUMP POSITION THIS IS THE POLICY OF THE SUPPOSEDLY SUPREMELY RATIONAL BARACK OBAMA WHO HAS MADE DEALS WITH CUBA AND IRAN HELD PEACE TALKS WITH PUTIN AND WALKED AWAY FROM HIS SYRIAN RED LINE WHICH HAS SINCE BEEN PAINTED MANY TIMES OVER IN BLOOD BY BASHAR ASSAD. OBAMA??S SPORADIC MILITARY INTERVENTIONS WITH NO LONG-TERM STRATEGIC BASIS ARE INTENDED TO IMPROVE POLL NUMBERS NOT NATIONAL SECURITY. SAYING THE U.S. CARES BUT ONLY ENOUGH TO DROP A FEW BILLION DOLLARS?? WORTH OF EXPLOSIVES??OFTEN HITTING CIVILIANS AND INFRASTRUCTURE??MAKES THINGS WORSE. TELLING THE WORLD TO GO TO HELL IS BAD ENOUGH DOING SO WHILE FANNING THE FLAMES EVEN HOTTER IS SICKENING. A FOREIGN POLICY CHOICE BETWEEN MORE CLINTON/OBAMA LIP SERVICE AND TRUMP/CRUZ NATIONALISM IS TERRIFYING. AFTER TWO TWO-TERM PRESIDENTS WITH DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED IDEOLOGIES ON FOREIGN POLICY AND DOMESTIC AFFAIRS AMERICA IS FACING AN EXISTENTIAL CHALLENGE. IS IT TO BE JUST ANOTHER COUNTRY ONE MORE NATION-STATE THAT JUST HAPPENS TO BE MUCH RICHER AND STRONGER THAN ANY OTHER? OR IS THERE STILL A CASE AND A CAUSE FOR AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM THAT SAYS THAT THE ONLY NATION FOUNDED ON THE IDEA OF FREEDOM HAS THE OBLIGATION TO USE ITS IMMENSE WEALTH AND POWER TO PROMOTE THAT FREEDOM ELSEWHERE? MY PERSONAL ANSWER ISN??T MUCH OF A SURPRISE SINCE IT??S ONE THAT I SHARE WITH NEARLY EVERYONE WHO HAS LIVED IN AN UNFREE STATE OR WHO HAS HAD THEIR FREEDOM MORTALLY THREATENED. I GREW UP IN THE SOVIET UNION IN A MIXED FAMILY??AND I DON??T MEAN MY ARMENIAN-JEWISH HERITAGE. MY BAKU RELATIVES INCLUDED DIE-HARD COMMUNISTS WHO WOULD EXCUSE NEARLY EVERY CATASTROPHE AND SHORTAGE AS THE FAULT OF FLAWED INDIVIDUALS NOT THE STATE OR THE SYSTEM. THEY LIVED IN A FRAGILE TRUCE WITH MY FATHER AND HIS BROTHER AND COUSINS NATURAL SKEPTICS WHO WANTED ME TO GROW UP WITHOUT ILLUSIONS. FOR AN INQUISITIVE CHILD WHO WAS INCLUDED EARLY ON IN FAMILY ARGUMENTS THERE WERE CLEAR FLAWS IN THE DELIGHTFUL THEORY THAT EVERYTHING SHOULD BE SHARED ??FROM EACH ACCORDING TO HIS ABILITY TO EACH ACCORDING TO HIS NEED.? I HAD BEEN EXPOSED TO A REAL MERITOCRACY EARLY IN LIFE AT THE CHESSBOARD AND THE IDEA THAT IT WAS WRONG TO ENJOY THE FRUITS OF SUCCESS SEEMED RIDICULOUS. WHY WORK HARD IF MY HARD WORK PRODUCED NO BENEFITS FOR ME AND MY FAMILY? AND IF SOCIALISM WAS SO WONDERFUL WHY DID IT HAVE TO BE IMPOSED BY FORCE? WHY COULD THE GREAT AND GENEROUS STATE ONLY BE CRITICIZED IN WHISPERS? OF COURSE THE SOVIET AUTHORITIES WERE WELL AWARE OF THESE CONTRADICTIONS AND THEIR SUBVERSIVE EFFECTS AND SO THEY SUBVERTED THEIR OWN PROPAGANDA WITH HYPOCRISY. THERE WERE REWARDS FOR SUCCESS TO A DEGREE ESTABLISHING THE PRINCIPLE OF ??EVERYONE IS EQUAL BUT SOME ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS? SO WELL SUMMARIZED IN GEORGE ORWELL??S ANIMAL FARM. IT TURNED OUT THAT NOT EVEN THE CHESSBOARD WAS SAFE FROM POLITICS AS I DISCOVERED WHEN I BEGAN MY ASSAULT ON CHESS OLYMPUS AND THE REIGNING WORLD CHAMPION ESTABLISHMENT DARLING ANATOLY KARPOV. THANKS TO CHESS I ALSO HAD THE RARE PRIVILEGE OF FOREIGN TRAVEL AS A TEENAGER WHICH GAVE ME THE CHANCE TO WITNESS THE HORRORS OF CAPITALISM AND DEMOCRACY WITH MY OWN EYES: HIGH LIVING STANDARDS FUNCTIONING INSTITUTIONS A VIBRANT CIVIL SOCIETY. IT DIDN??T TAKE LONG FOR ME TO REALIZE THAT THE WEST WAS THE REAL WORLD AND IT WAS MY HOME THAT WAS THE CHARADE. I BEGAN TO SPEAK PUBLICLY ABOUT THIS DISCONNECT IN INTERVIEWS WITH WESTERN PUBLICATIONS PUSHING MY LUCK AS A CELEBRITY AND ALSO PUSHING THE EDGE OF CREEPING LIBERALIZATION UNDER MIKHAIL GORBACHEV. CHESS HAD LONG BEEN AN IDEOLOGICAL TOOL TO PROMOTE THE SUPERIORITY OF THE SOVIET MAN OVER THE SELFISH AND LAZY WEST. SO IT WAS QUITE A SCANDAL FOR THE SOVIET WORLD CHAMPION TO PROCLAIM HIS ADMIRATION FOR AMERICANS AS ??CLOSE TO TRUE HUMAN NATURE? AS I DID IN THE SUMMER OF 1989??TO PLAYBOY MAGAZINE NO LESS. WHEN RONALD REAGAN WENT TO BERLIN AND DEMANDED THAT GORBACHEV ??TEAR DOWN THIS WALL? IN 1987 IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR MOST OF US LIVING BEHIND THAT WALL TO IMAGINE ITS FALL COULD BE ANYTHING BUT A BLESSING FOR US. IT WAS NOT MERE RHETORIC IT WAS A TANGIBLE DEMONSTRATION THAT PEOPLE ON THE OUTSIDE CARED ABOUT OUR FATE AND WERE FIGHTING TO FREE US FROM IT. HAVING BEEN RAISED TO THINK OF THE UNITED STATES AS AN ENEMY THAT MIGHT BOMB US INTO OBLIVION AT ANY MOMENT THIS EVOLUTION TO THINKING OF THE U.S. AS AN ALLY??OF THE SOVIET PEOPLE AGAINST OUR LEADERS??WAS NO SMALL TRANSITION. HOW ARE THE OPPRESSED PEOPLE OF RUSSIA IRAN AND SYRIA SUPPOSED TO FEEL ABOUT AMERICA TODAY WHEN THEY SEE OBAMA MAKING DEALS THAT EMPOWER THEIR DESPOTIC RULERS? THE END OF THE COLD WAR ALSO MARKED A TRANSITION OF HOW AMERICANS WERE PERCEIVED IN THE WORLD AND HOW THEY PERCEIVED THEMSELVES. IT??S ONE THING TO BE THE GOOD GUY IN THE MOVIE WHEN THERE IS AN EVIL EMPIRE TO VANQUISH. WITH NO RIVAL WORTH THE EFFORT AFTER THE USSR??S COLLAPSE THE WHITE COWBOY HAT OF RONALD REAGAN WAS RETIRED. IT MADE A BRIEF REAPPEARANCE ON THE UNEASY HEAD OF GEORGE W. BUSH AFTER 9/11 BUT THE CATASTROPHIC OUTCOME OF HIS INVASION OF IRAQ PUT IT BACK IN THE CLOSET. REGARDLESS OF WHERE YOU STAND ON THE 2003 IRAQ WAR AND BECAUSE OF MY BACKGROUND I CANNOT CONDEMN ANY ACTION THAT REMOVES A DICTATOR THAT IT TOOK SO MUCH CAMPAIGNING AND FALSIFIED EVIDENCE TO GENERATE PUBLIC SUPPORT WAS A CLEAR SIGN THAT AMERICANS HAD MOVED ON FROM THE BUSINESS OF FIGHTING EVIL. BUT THE IRAQ WAR WAS A REBUKE TO BAD PLANNING AND LOUSY IMPLEMENTATION NOT A REFUTATION OF THE IDEA THAT AMERICA CAN BE AN ESSENTIAL FORCE FOR GOOD IN THE WORLD. AMERICA MUST DO BETTER NOT DO NOTHING. NO MATTER HOW MUCH THE ISOLATIONISTS AND PACIFISTS WANT TO BELIEVE IT THE JIHADISTS DICTATORS AND OTHER THREATS TO AMERICAN LIVES AND ITS INTERESTS WILL NOT DISAPPEAR EVEN IF THE U.S. CONTINUES TO RETREAT FROM EVERY GLOBAL CHALLENGE AND CONFLICT. NOR WILL CEDING GEOPOLITICAL INFLUENCE AND SECURITY COMMITMENTS TO OTHER NATIONS MAKE THE WORLD SAFER OR MORE STABLE ESPECIALLY IF THAT POWER IS CEDED TO AGGRESSIVE DICTATORSHIPS LIKE IRAN AND PUTIN??S RUSSIA. EUROPE IS CLOSER TO THE FRONT LINES AGAINST JIHADISM AND PUTIN??S AGGRESSION BUT HAS LET ITS MILITARY ATROPHY ALONG WITH ITS WILL TO USE IT. THE COMPLETE LACK OF A COHERENT EU SECURITY POLICY MEANS THAT UNLESS THE UNITED STATES REDISCOVERS ITS ROLE AS AN ACTIVE FORCE FOR STABILITY AND SECURITY IN THE WORLD BOTH STABILITY AND SECURITY ARE IN TROUBLE. IF STOPPING THE ISLAMIC STATE IS A REAL PRIORITY??AS OBAMA SAYS IT IS AS EVERY 2016 CANDIDATE SAYS IT IS AS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAY IT IS??THEN IT SHOULD NOT BE SO DIFFICULT TO DISCARD THE POLICIES THAT HAVE CLEARLY FAILED TO DO SO. SEVENTY YEARS AGO HARRY TRUMAN BUILT NEW INSTITUTIONS AND MADE A HUGE INVESTMENT IN STABILIZING EUROPE AND STOPPING THE ADVANCE OF COMMUNISM WORLD-WIDE. THE CIA NSC NATO VOICE OF AMERICA AND THE MARSHALL PLAN INTERVENTION IN GREECE TAIWAN AND KOREA ALL PARTS AN AMBITIOUS ECONOMIC MILITARY AND COMMUNICATIONS OFFENSIVE TO FIGHT AND WIN THE COLD WAR. THE GOP FOUGHT TRUMAN ON MANY OF THESE BOLD PLANS AS DID MEMBERS OF HIS OWN CABINET BUT EVENTUALLY THE CONTAINMENT MODEL WAS ACCEPTED BY THE REPUBLICAN EISENHOWER AND EVERY SUBSEQUENT ADMINISTRATION AS A NECESSITY. SO FAR MARCO RUBIO IS THE ONLY PROMINENT CANDIDATE TO DEMONSTRATE THE PREPARATION AND INSTINCTS TO RETURN AMERICA TO ITS VITAL ROLE BUT EVEN HE HAS BEEN LIMITED BY POLL NUMBERS AND INTIMIDATED BY THE FOCUS GROUPS THAT INSIST AMERICA SHOULD MIND ITS OWN BUSINESS UNTIL IT GOES OUT OF BUSINESS. I HOPE THAT THERE IS STILL A PLACE IN 2016 FOR AN OPTIMISTIC VISION THAT CALLS FOR USING AMERICA??S INCREDIBLE RESOURCES TO HELP INSTEAD OF HARM TO BUILD INSTEAD OF BOMB TO FREE THE OPPRESSED INSTEAD OF BARGAINING WITH THEIR OPPRESSORS AND TO PROTECT THE INNOCENT INSTEAD OF CONSIDERING THEM COLLATERAL DAMAGE. AMERICANS HAVE BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO DEMANDING THE IMPOSSIBLE AND THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO PROVIDING IT. MASSIVE DEBT FUELS EDUCATION AND THE STOCK MARKET. CALLS FOR GREATER SECURITY ARE ACCOMPANIED BY A REFUSAL TO INVEST OR SACRIFICE TO ACHIEVE IT. THE BIPARTISAN ACCEPTANCE OF REALITY HAS GONE MISSING IN AMERICA??S HYPER-PARTISAN POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT. THE IDEA THAT AMERICA MUST BE A FORCE FOR STABILITY AND FREEDOM HAS BEEN ABANDONED BY WASHINGTON REFLECTING AN AMERICAN MAIN STREET MORE INTERESTED IN FLEETING STOCK MARKET VALUES THAN IN THE LASTING VALUES OF GLOBAL DEMOCRACY. 2015 WAS A DANGEROUS YEAR AND 2016 WILL BE EVEN MORE DANGEROUS UNLESS AMERICA REMEMBERS WHAT IT STANDS FOR. ,14641.0

SOUTH CAROLINA GOVERNOR NIKKI HALEY GAVE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY??S OFFICIAL RESPONSE TO PRESIDENT OBAMA??S FINAL STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH AND HER SPEECH MOSTLY DREW ATTENTION FOR IT??S JUST-BARELY-VEILED CRITICISM OF DONALD TRUMP??S ANTI-IMMIGRANT RHETORIC. BUT THOSE ON THE FAR-RIGHT MAY HAVE MISSED THE MOST QUIETLY CONSEQUENTIAL PART OF HALEY??S SPEECH. TOWARDS THE END OF THE ADDRESS THE GOVERNOR TACITLY SUGGESTED THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WOULD CHANGE ITS COURSE ON SAME-SEX MARRIAGE IF IT WON THE WHITE HOUSE. ??WE WOULD RESPECT DIFFERENCES IN MODERN FAMILIES? SHE SAID ??BUT WE WOULD ALSO INSIST ON RESPECT FOR RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AS A CORNERSTONE OF OUR DEMOCRACY.? ON ITS FACE THAT SENTENCE MAY SOUND A LITTLE MILQUETOAST -- WHAT POLITICIAN WOULD SUGGEST HER PARTY WOULDN??T RESPECT FAMILIES? BUT CONSERVATIVE OPERATIVES PUSHING FOR THE PARTY TO SHIFT ITS STANCE ON MARRIAGE SEE THE COMMENT AS A BIG WIN. THAT??S BECAUSE HER SPECIFIC PHRASING IS LIFTED ALMOST VERBATIM FROM ONE GROUP??S PROPOSED RE-WORDING OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY PLATFORM. THE EFFORT IS CALLED PLATFORM REFORM AND IT??S A PROJECT OF THE AMERICAN UNITY FUND WHICH IS BACKED IN PART BY REPUBLICAN HEDGE FUND BILLIONAIRE PAUL SINGER A STAUNCH ADVOCATE OF SAME-SEX MARRIAGE WHO PLAYED AN OUTSIZE ROLE IN GETTING THE NEW YORK LEGISLATURE TO LEGALIZE BACK IN 2011. THE PLATFORM-REFORMING CAMPAIGN AIMS TO MAKE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY NEUTRAL ON THE ISSUE OF SAME-SEX MARRIAGE. CURRENTLY THE PLATFORM EXPLICITLY OPPOSES IT. ??[W]E BELIEVE THAT MARRIAGE THE UNION OF ONE MAN AND ONE WOMAN MUST BE UPHELD AS THE NATIONAL STANDARD A GOAL TO STAND FOR ENCOURAGE AND PROMOTE THROUGH LAWS GOVERNING MARRIAGE? THE PLATFORM CURRENTLY READS. THE PLATFORM REFORM EFFORT WANTS THAT LANGUAGE TO SAY THIS: ??[W]E ENCOURAGE AND WELCOME A THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATION AMONG REPUBLICANS ABOUT THE MEANING AND IMPORTANCE OF MARRIAGE AND AND COMMIT OUR PARTY TO RESPECT FOR ALL FAMILIES AND FAIRNESS AND FREEDOM FOR ALL AMERICANS.? PLATFORM REFORM OPERATIVES SAID THEY DIDN??T THINK HALEY??S WORD CHOICE WAS A COINCIDENCE. ??I THINK IT??S FANTASTIC BECAUSE THAT??S THE EXACT SORT OF THING THAT REPUBLICAN IDEALS POINT TOWARDS STRONG FAMILIES AND THAT??S WHY WE THINK OUR PLATFORM SHOULD BE REFORMED? SAID JERRI ANN HENRY THE PLATFORM REFORM CAMPAIGN MANAGER. ??SO I THINK IT??S FANTASTIC THAT SHE INCLUDED THAT AS A TOP PRIORITY IN HER RESPONSE.? HENRY ADDED THAT HER GROUP HAS PASSED ITS MATERIALS TO HALEY??S OFFICE. ??PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY WHO??S EVER BEEN ELECTED WITH AN R BY THEIR NAME HAS HEARD FROM US? SHE SAID. AND HENRY SAID SHE??S OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THEIR ODDS. ??IT??S GONNA HAPPEN? SHE SAID. THE RATIONALE IS THIS: RNC MEMBERS ARE TIRED OF LOSING AND THEY DON??T WANT TO LOSE BECAUSE OF A RIDE-OR-DIE COMMITMENT TO AN ISSUE THAT THE SUPREME COURT HAS DECIDED IS DONE. HALEY??S OFFICE DIDN??T RESPOND TO A REQUEST FOR COMMENT ON HER STANCE ABOUT THE PARTY PLATFORM. AT THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE??S WINTER MEETING IN CHARLESTON THE CAMPAIGN HANDED OUT COLOR PRINTOUTS OF HALEY??S LINE ABOUT RESPECTING MODERN FAMILIES. THEY ALSO LOBBIED MEMBERS OF THE RNC TO BACK THE EFFORT TO CHANGE THE PLATFORM??S LANGUAGE. AND PEOPLE LISTENED. KIRSTEN HUGHES THE MASSACHUSETTS REPUBLICAN PARTY CHAIRMAN SAID THE GROUP HAD REACHED OUT TO HER AND SHE WAS OPEN TO THEIR PITCH. ??I KNOW IT??S GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT WE??RE TALKING ABOUT? SHE SAID. ??SURE I??M OPEN TO IT.? MATT MOORE THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SOUTH CAROLINA REPUBLICAN PARTY SAID HE FEELS DIFFERENTLY. ??WE ARE A CONSERVATIVE PARTY THAT BELIEVES IN THE CONSERVATIVE DEFINITION OF MARRIAGE? HE SAID. ??BUT WE ARE INTERESTED IN GROWING THE PARTY.? ??I WANT THE PLATFORM TO REMAIN FOR TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE? HE ADDED. ??BUT FOR THOSE WHO DON??T WE WANT THEM IN THE PARTY AS WELL.? THAT SAID SOUTH CAROLINA MIGHT BE ONE OF THE LEAST HOSPITABLE STATES FOR THIS EFFORT. A POLL THAT AMERICAN UNITY FUND COMMISSIONED LAST SUMMER -- FROM TARGETPOINT CONSULTING SURVEYING 2000 REGISTERED VOTERS OVER A WEEK IN JUNE -- SHOWED THAT SOUTH CAROLINA REPUBLICAN PRIMARY VOTERS ARE EVEN MORE OPPOSED TO SAME-SEX MARRIAGE THAN THEIR PEERS IN IOWA. THAT POLL SHOWED THAT 47 PERCENT OF IOWA REPUBLICAN LIKELY-VOTERS FAVORED SAME-SEX MARRIAGE AND 22 PERCENT SUPPORTED IT MORE OVER THE PAST 5 YEARS. IN SOUTH CAROLINA HOWEVER JUST 39 PERCENT OF LIKELY REPUBLICAN PRIMARY VOTERS BACKED SAME-SEX MARRIAGE RIGHTS AND ONLY 16 PERCENT BECAME MORE SUPPORTIVE OF IT OVER THE PAST 5 YEARS. CINDY COSTA THE RNC COMMITTEEWOMAN FROM SOUTH CAROLINA EXPRESSED SKEPTICISM ABOUT THE POLITICAL PROMISE OF PLATFORM-NEUTRALIZATION EFFORTS. ??I WOULD SAY LET??S NOT DO IT? SHE SAID. ??IT??S NOT NECESSARY.

BUT THE BILLBOARD HAS ARGUABLY DONE MORE TO GENERATE CONTROVERSY CRACKS AND CONFUSION THAN USERS. MANY WILL ARGUE THAT A DATING SITE DEVOTED TO RACIAL PREFERENCES IS IMPLICITLY RACIST. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE AMPLE DATING SITES DEVOTED TO HELPING PEOPLE SEEKING RACIAL RELIGIOUS ETHNIC AND OTHER GROUPS A SITE DEVOTED TO A PREFERENCE FOR WHITES RUBBED PEOPLE THE WRONG WAY. EVEN THOUGH THE DATING SITE??S FOUNDER SAM RUSSELL ADAMANTLY DENIED A RACIST OBJECTIVE TO WHEREWHITEPEOPLEMEET.COM IT??S NOT DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW IT COULD BECOME A HOTBED FOR WHITE NATIONALISTS OR CONVERSELY THOSE WHO ENJOY TROLLING THEM.

BUT WHEN THE DAILY BEAST ASKED HOW SOMEONE SEEKING A SAME-SEX RELATIONSHIP ON WHEREWHITEPEOPLEMEET.COM COULD LOGISTICALLY SEARCH FOR DATES RUSSELL ADMITTED THAT ??IN REALITY IT??S PROBABLY NOT EASY BUT AT THE SAME TIME THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF DATING WEBSITES FOR PEOPLE TO GO TO FOR WHATEVER IT IS THEY WANT.

THE TRIAL WHERE COSBY WILL FACE ACCUSATIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT BY ANDREA CONSTAND IS A REMATCH BETWEEN DEFENSE ATTORNEY BRIAN MCMONAGLE AND KEVIN STEELE THE NEW DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF MONTGOMERY COUNTY PENNSYLVANIA. TWO YEARS AGO THE TWO ATTORNEYS BATTLED IN COURT OVER ANOTHER POWERFUL MAN ACCUSED OF DRUGGING AND SEXUALLY ASSAULTING A WOMAN UNDER HIS INFLUENCE. FOR THE PAST 25 YEARS MCMONAGLE HAS DEFENDED HIGH-PROFILE CLIENTS LIKE KILLER COPS ALLEGED MOBSTERS AND ACCUSED RAPISTS??AND HE HAS WON A LARGE MAJORITY OF CASES THANKS IN PART TO HIS EXPERIENCE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COURTROOM AS A PROSECUTOR. FROM 1984 TO 1991 MCMONAGLE WORKED IN THE HOMICIDE UNIT OF THE PHILLY D.A.??S OFFICE EARNING ADMIRATION OF COLLEAGUES AND DEFENDANTS ALIKE. THE PUBLIC SERVANT SAID HE ENTERED PRIVATE PRACTICE TO EARN MORE MONEY FOR HIS GROWING FAMILY BUT THAT DIDN??T DULL HIS EDGE. ??I LIKE BATTLE AND I LIKE COMPETITION? HE SAID IN A TV AD FOR HIS LAW FIRM. ??WHEN YOU HIRE US YOU??VE HIRED SOMEONE WHO MAY NOT GUARANTEE YOU A WIN BUT WILL GUARANTEE YOU A WAR.? ARGUING THE GOVERNMENT??S CASE AGAINST COSBY IS STEELE A 20-YEAR VETERAN OF THE D.A.??S OFFICE. STEELE WAS ELECTED TO BE TOP PROSECUTOR IN NOVEMBER AFTER BEATING THE FORMER D.A. BRUCE CASTOR WHO LEFT BUT WANTED HIS OLD JOB BACK. STEELE USED CASTOR??S DECISION IN 2005 NOT TO PROSECUTE COSBY?ŸIN ORDER TO PAINT CASTOR AS SOFT ON PREDATORS. MCMONAGLE AND STEELE DECLINED TO SPEAK TO THE DAILY BEAST FOR THIS STORY. STEELE IS POSSESSED BY A SIMILAR DRIVE AS MCMONAGLE EVIDENCED BY THE WRISTBAND HE IS SAID TO WEAR EVERY DAY THAT READS ??DAVID GROVE 11-11-2010.? GROVE WAS A WILDLIFE CONSERVATION OFFICER WHO WAS MURDERED AND STEEL WAS CALLED IN BY ANOTHER COUNTY??S D.A. TO ASSIST IN GETTING A CONVICTION THANKS TO HIS EXPERIENCE IN TRYING AND WINNING CAPITAL CASES. STEELE DID JUST THAT HELPING SEND SEND CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON TO DEATH ROW IN 2012. A YEAR LATER ANOTHER HIGH PROFILE CASE LANDED ON STEELE??S DESK. ROBERT KERNS WAS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE MONTGOMERY COUNTY REPUBLICAN PARTY AND A PARTNER AT THE KERNS PEARLSTINE ONORATO & HLADIK LAW FIRM. IN NOVEMBER 2013 A GRAND JURY CHARGED KERNS WITH AGGRAVATED INDECENT ASSAULT (THE SAME CHARGE AS COSBY) FOR ALLEGEDLY DRUGGING AND RAPING A WOMAN WHO WORKED FOR HIM. WITH STEELE STANDING BESIDES HER DISTRICT ATTORNEY ROSE VETRI FERMAN ANNOUNCED KERNS??S ARREST AND DETAILED THE STATE??S CASE AGAINST HIM IN A PRESS CONFERENCE. ON OCTOBER 25 2013 A 51-YEAR-OLD PARALEGAL AT KERNS??S FIRM WENT TO A COMPANY PARTY AT A RESTAURANT. THE WOMAN SAID SHE HAD A FEW DRINKS AND WAS CONCERNED ABOUT DRIVING HERSELF TO A NEARBY MALL TO GO SHOPPING WITH A FRIEND. KERNS SAID HE HAD TO GO THERE ANYWAY AND OFFERED TO GIVE HER A LIFT SAYING HE WOULD ALSO TAKE HER BACK TO THE RESTAURANT LATER TO RETRIEVE HER CAR. INSTEAD ACCORDING TO PROSECUTORS KERNS GAVE THE WOMAN WINE LACED WITH DRUGS THEN ASSAULTED HER IN THE PARKING LOT AND AGAIN IN HER OWN HOME. AN AFFIDAVIT IN THE CRIMINAL COMPLAINT SAID THE WOMAN SUSTAINED INJURIES THAT WERE VISIBLE SIX DAYS LATER AND INTERNAL BLEEDING THAT LASTED 13 DAYS. THE WOMAN SAID SHE AWOKE THE NEXT MORNING ALONE IN HER OWN BED NUDE FROM THE WAIST DOWN COVERED IN DRIED VOMIT HER SHOULDER BLADES AND VAGINA WERE SORE SCRATCHES AND BRUISES WERE PRESENT ON HER THIGHS WHICH SHE PHOTOGRAPHED WITH HER CELL PHONE. THE WOMAN SAID SHE FOUND HER MISSING PANTS AND UNDERWEAR ON THE KITCHEN COUNTER ALONG WITH A WINE GLASS THAT HELD A $100 BILL. THE WOMAN WENT TO THE HOSPITAL WHERE MEDICAL STAFF PERFORMED A SEXUAL-ASSAULT EXAMINATION THAT NOTED THE PRESENCE OF A MAN??S DNA AND GENITAL LACERATIONS. THE WOMAN TOLD DETECTIVES SHE HAD FEW CLEAR MEMORIES OF THE NIGHT BEFORE BUT REMEMBERS GETTING INTO KERNS??S CAR AND HE TELLING HER TO POUR TWO GLASSES OF WINE FROM AN OPEN BOTTLE. SHE SAID SHE DRANK SOME BUT DID NOT SEE KERNS DO SO. KERNS HAD LACED THE WINE WITH THE SLEEPING DRUG AMBIEN GRAND JURY FOUND. INVESTIGATORS OBTAINED A SEARCH WARRANT AND FOUND VOMIT INSIDE HIS MERCEDES AND FOUND IN THE TRUNK PINK DUCT TAPE AN OPEN BOTTLE OF VODKA AND LUBRICATING JELLY. KERNS TOLD DETECTIVES THE ALLEGED VICTIM HAD STARTED VOMITING IN THE CAR AND THAT HE STAYED IN THE MALL??S PARKING GARAGE WHILE TENDING TO HER BEFORE TAKING HER HOME. DETECTIVES ALSO TAPED PHONE CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN KERNS AND A FRIEND AT HIS FIRM WHO AGREED TO BE RECORDED. HE DENIED ASSAULTING THE WOMAN WHEN ASKED DIRECTLY BUT WHEN THE FRIEND TOLD HIM THAT THE WOMAN HAD INJURIES CONSISTENT WITH RAPE AND THAT THE EVIDENCE AGAINST KERNS SEEMED STRONG ??IF IT IS IT IS? KERNS SAID. ??YOU KNOW THAT??S WHY I GOT MCMONAGLE.? AT A PRELIMINARY HEARING THE FIRST AND ONLY TIME THE ACCUSER APPEARED IN COURT SHE TESTIFIED SHE HAD ONLY ??OBSCURE DREAM-LIKE MEMORIES OF MY HEAD UP AGAINST THE WINDOW OF THE CAR AND PUSHING [KERNS] AWAY.? ONCE AT HOME SHE SAID SHE ?KNEW IT WAS HAPPENING BUT IT WAS LIKE I HAD NO WHEREWITHAL TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.? MCMONAGLE PRESSED HER TO PROVIDE DETAILS OF EVENTS THAT SHE HAD ALREADY TESTIFIED OCCURRED WHILE SHE WAS EITHER UNCONSCIOUS OR INCAPACITATED??LIKE WHAT TIME SHE HAD REMOVED HER PANTS AND UNDERWEAR. HOSPITAL RECORDS DID ??DEPICT SOME BRUISING? MCMONAGLE ADMITTED BUT THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE INDICATING ??THAT THERE HAD BEEN INTERCOURSE OF ANY KIND IN THIS CASE? HE TOLD THE JUDGE BEFORE ASKING HIM TO DISMISS THE CHARGES OF RAPE AND AGGRAVATED INDECENT ASSAULT. PROSECUTOR SAMANTHA CAUFFMAN WHO ARGUED THE CASE AT KERNS??S PRELIMINARY HEARING TOLD THE JUDGE THAT THE WOMAN ??HAS PENETRATION INJURIES SHE HAS TEARS AND RIPS. [VIOLENT INTERCOURSE] IS THE ONLY THING THAT COULD HAVE CAUSED DAMAGE TO HER INSIDE.? THE JUDGE ORDERED THE CASE GO TO TRIAL. BUT THEN MCMONAGLE HIRED TWO EXPERTS TO ANALYZE THE TOXICOLOGY REPORT THAT FOUND AMBIEN IN THE WINE AND THEY FOUND AN ERROR IN HOW THE REPORT HAD BEEN INTERPRETED TO THE GRAND JURY. THAT MEANT THE GRAND JURY HAD INDICTED KERNS BASED IN PART ON MISLEADING TESTIMONY. ON MARCH 17 2014 STEELE TOLD A JUDGE THAT HIS OFFICE WAS DROPPING THE CHARGES BECAUSE OF THE TECHNICAL ERROR. MCMONAGLE GAVE PROSECUTORS A NOD FOR THEIR SWIFT ACTION TO REMEDY THEIR MISTAKE. ??I??M CONFIDENT THAT THIS WAS AN HONEST MISTAKE MADE BY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY??S OFFICE AND UPON LEARNING OF IT THEY DID THE RIGHT THING AND PUT AN END TO THIS HORRIBLE NIGHTMARE? HE SAID. IN OCTOBER 2014 CITING MISSTEPS IN THE KERNS CASE D.A. FERMAN AND STEELE ANNOUNCED THEY HAD COMMISSIONED A THIRD PARTY TO REVIEW THE PROSECUTION AND WERE CREATING TWO NEW POSITIONS TO OVERSEE TRIALS AND PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS. THE PENNSYLVANIA ATTORNEY GENERAL TOOK UP THE CASE AND KERNS LATER PLEADED NO CONTEST TO TWO MISDEMEANORS. HE WAS SENTENCED TO TWO YEARS PROBATION MADE TO REGISTER AS A SEX OFFENDER PAY A FINE OF $500 AND PAY HIS VICTIM $153.39 IN RESTITUTION. STEELE WILL HAVE A MUCH HARDER TIME PROVING COSBY SEXUALLY ASSAULTED AND DRUGGED CONSTAND IF FOR NO OTHER REASON THAT THERE IS NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE THIS TIME.?ŸINSTEAD STEELE IS GOING TO TRY TO USE COSBY'S OWN WORDS AGAINST HIM FROM A 2005 DEPOSITION IN CONSTAND'S CIVIL CASE. IN THAT DEPOSITION COSBY ADMITTED TO GIVING WOMEN DRUGS BEFORE HE HAD SEX WITH THEM (THOUGH HE SAYS IT WAS CONSENTUAL). BUT THERE'S A CATCH. MCMONAGLE'S FILING LAST WEE TO DISMISS THE CHARGES CONTAINED A CLAIM THAT STEELE??S ??NEW? EVIDENCE FROM CONSTAND??S CIVIL SUIT IS OFF LIMITS TO THE PROSECUTION BECAUSE EX-D.A. CASTOR PROMISED THAT HIS OFFICE WOULD NEVER BRING CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST THE COMEDIAN FOR THE ALLEGED ASSAULT IN RETURN FOR COSBY??S DEPOSITION. CASTOR EMAILED STEELE'S PREDECESSOR AS D.A. A FEW MONTHS AGO TELLING HER HE ??AGREED MORE THAN A DECADE AGO? NOT TO USE COSBY??S CIVIL DEPOSITIONS IN A CRIMINAL CASE AGAINST HIM CNN REPORTS. ??I CAN SEE NO POSSIBILITY?ŸTHAT COSBY??S DEPOSITION COULD BE USED IN A STATE CRIMINAL CASE BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE TO TESTIFY AS TO WHAT HAPPENED AND THE DEPOSITION WOULD BE SUBJECT TO SUPPRESSION.? STEELE SAYS THE EMAIL?ŸDOESN??T STYMIE HIS CASE BECAUSE CASTOR??S VERBAL PROMISE IS NOT LEGALLY BINDING FOR STEELE??S OFFICE. ??THERE IS A SPECIFIC LEGAL METHOD TO GRANT IMMUNITY. THAT WAS NOT DONE IN 2005? HE TOLD CNN. INDEED MCMONAGLE'S MOTION DOES NOT CITE ANY EXPLICIT AGREEMENT NOT TO PROSECUTE. MCMONAGLE'S MOTION ALSO REFERENCES STEELE??S POLITICAL CAMPAIGN BUILT AROUND COSBY. THE MOTION CITES STEEL'S OWN DESCRIPTION OF TV COMMERCIALS PUBLIC STATEMENTS AND FLYERS CRITICAL OF CASTOR??S DECISION TO NOT PROSECUTE COSBY ??A CRUCIAL NEW PHASE OF HIS CAMPAIGN.? MCMONAGLE SAYS THIS SHOULD RULE STEELE OUT AS AN IMPARTIAL BROKER SO THE JUDGE SHOULD DISQUALIFY HIM FROM THE TRYING THE CASE.?Ÿ ??MY OFFICE DOES NOT TRY ANY CASE IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION? STEELE SAID IN A STATEMENT LAST WEEK ??WE TRY THEM IN A COURT OF LAW. WE WILL BE FILING A RESPONSE TO THEIR MOTION AND WE WILL LET OUR LEGAL RESPONSE TO THEIR MOTION SPEAK FOR ITSELF.? IF A JUDGE LETS THE TRIAL PROCEED STEELE WILL TY TO STRENGTHEN HIS CASE AGAINST COSBY BY BRINGING FORWARD AS MANY AS 50 WOMEN TO TESTIFY THAT COSBY DID THE SAME THING TO THEM AS CONSTAND. PENNSYLVANIA LAW ALLOWS ??OTHER CRIMES WRONGS OR ACTS? TO BE OFFERED AS ??HABIT EVIDENCE? AGAINST DEFENDANTS. PROSECUTORS WILL TRY TO ESTABLISH COSBY??S ALLEGED PATTERN OF SEDUCING DRUGGING AND ASSAULTING WOMEN. MCMONAGLE OF COURSE WILL ARGUE THEY SHOULDN??T TESTIFY. IF THEY DO MCMONAGLE WILL NOT GO EASY ON THEM. FOR EXAMPLE IN 1999 MCMONAGLE DEFENDED PHILADELPHIA POLICE OFFICER FRED GAETHERS WHO WAS CHARGED WITH RAPING A WOMAN HE HAD OFFERED TO PAY FOR SEX. THE WOMAN WAS AS A HEALTH-CARE PROFESSIONAL BUT MCMONAGLE FORCED HER TO ADMIT SHE HAD ONCE BEEN A PROSTITUTE. WHEN GAETHERS WAS FOUND NOT GUILTY HE GRINNED AND THANKED THE JURY. MEANWHILE HIS ALLEGED VICTIM REPORTEDLY ??BURIED HER FACE IN HER HANDS AND BEGAN SOBBING IN THE BACK ROW OF THE COURTROOM.? STILL MCMONAGLE WILL HAVE HIS WORK CUT OUT FOR HIM SAYS MICHAEL PILEGGI A FEDERAL CIVIL RIGHTS AND CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY WHOSE CLIENTS WERE RECENTLY CROSS-EXAMINED BY MCMONAGLE. ??YOU HAVE ALL OF THESE WOMEN COMING FORWARD SO IT??S NOT JUST THE CREDIBILITY OF ONE WITNESS? PILEGGI SAID. ??HE??S GOT SOME MOUNTAIN TO CLIMB I??LL SAY THAT. HE??S GOING TO HAVE TO ATTACK EACH AND EVERY WITNESS.? THAT INCLUDES CONSTAND. ??FROM A LAWYER??S PERSPECTIVE I THINK YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO TREAD LIGHTLY WITH THESE TYPES OF CASES? PILEGGI SAID. ??IT DOES COME INTO THE CREDIBILITY ISSUE IT??S ALWAYS A FACTOR. BUT YOU KNOW WITH THESE SEXUAL CASES YOU HAVE TO STRIKE A BALANCE BECAUSE OFTENTIMES IT CAN LOOK LIKE YOU??RE TRYING TO INTIMIDATE THE WITNESS AND THAT TURNS JURIES OFF. ON THE OTHER HAND THAT??S THE ONE AREA OF ATTACK THAT HE HAS THE CREDIBILITY OF THE WITNESS.? MCMONAGLE WILL HAVE TO WAIT FOR HIS FIRST SHOT AT CONSTAND.?ŸON FEBRUARY 2 BOTH SIDES WILL ARGUE OVER HIS MOTION TO DISMISS THE CHARGES. IF THE MAGISTRATE DENIES IT THEN STEELE MUST STILL MEET MCMONAGLE AGAIN AT A PRELIMINARY HEARING TO CONVINCE TO HER HONOR THERE??S ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO TAKE THE CASE TO TRIAL. THEN THE REMATCH WILL REALLY BEGIN. ,36398.0

THAT JUROR BELIEVED AVERY WAS FRAMED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT NEVER SPOKE UP FOR FEAR OF RETRIBUTION ACCORDING TO THE DIRECTING DUO. ??[THE JUROR] TOLD US THAT THEY BELIEVE STEVEN AVERY WAS NOT PROVEN GUILTY? RICCIARDI SAID. ??THEY BELIEVE STEVEN WAS FRAMED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THAT HE DESERVES A NEW TRIAL AND IF HE RECEIVES A NEW TRIAL IN THEIR OPINION IT SHOULD TAKE PLACE FAR AWAY FROM WISCONSIN.? THE JUROR SAID THE DELIBERATIONS INCLUDED BEHIND-THE-SCENES VOTE-TRADING AND THAT THE VERDICTS ON EACH COUNT WERE ??A COMPROMISE.? (WARDMAN TOLD THE DAILY BEAST THAT VOTE-TRADING ??NEVER HAPPENED.?) AT TRIAL JURORS WERE ALLEGEDLY SAYING ??IF YOU VOTE GUILTY ON THIS COUNT I WILL VOTE NOT GUILTY ON THIS COUNT? RICCIARDI SAID. INDEED AVERY??S DEFENSE TEAM HINTED AT POSSIBLE JURY ROOM INTRIGUE IN MAKING A MURDERER. BUTING SPECULATED THAT SOMETHING FISHY MIGHT HAVE SWAYED JURORS WHO INITIALLY VOTED SEVEN INNOCENT THREE GUILTY AND TWO UNDECIDED. IN THE FINAL EPISODE OF THE SERIES BUTING SAID NEWLY DISCOVERED EVIDENCE??IN PARTICULAR ABOUT THE JURY??COULD LEAD TO AVERY??S FREEDOM. THERE COULD BE ??OTHER PEOPLE WHO KNOW SOMETHING? BUTING SAID. ??IT MAY BE SOMEBODY ON THE JURY.

TRUMP,IF YOU LIVE IN IOWA AND OWN A PHONE YOU MIGHT GET A CALL THIS WEEK THAT SOUNDS SOMETHING LIKE THIS: ??I URGE YOU TO VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE HE IS THE ONE CANDIDATE WHO POINTS OUT THAT WE SHOULD ACCEPT IMMIGRANTS WHO ARE GOOD FOR AMERICA. WE DON??T NEED MUSLIMS. WE NEED SMART WELL-EDUCATED WHITE PEOPLE WHO WILL ASSIMILATE TO OUR CULTURE. VOTE TRUMP.? THIS JARRING MESSAGE IS JUST ONE PART OF A ROBOCALL RECORDED ON BEHALF OF DONALD TRUMP BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL SUPER PAC CREATED BY NONE OTHER THAN THE LEADER OF THE AMERICAN FREEDOM PARTY A PROMINENT WHITE NATIONALIST ORGANIZATION. IN THE LAST MONTH THE POLITICAL PARTY???ŸWHICH ONCE TRIED TO REVOKE THE CITIZENSHIP OF EVERY NON-WHITE INHABITANT OF THE UNITED STATES??HAS EVOLVED FROM SUPPORTING TRUMP??S CANDIDACY TO FORMALLY ENDORSING HIM FOR PRESIDENT. THAT ENDORSEMENT MADE AMERICAN FREEDOM PARTY HISTORY SINCE THEY HAD NEVER BEFORE ENDORSED A CANDIDATE OUTSIDE OF THEIR OWN RANKS. BUT THE GROUP THAT REPRESENTS ??THE POLITICAL INTERESTS OF WHITE AMERICANS? WAS WILLING TO MAKE AN EXCEPTION FOR THE REPUBLICAN FRONTRUNNER. ??WE DO HAVE OUR OWN CANDIDATE BUT BOB WHITAKER OUR CANDIDATE HAS TOLD US THAT IT IS ALRIGHT TO ENDORSE DONALD TRUMP? THE AMERICAN FREEDOM PARTY??S LEADER WILLIAM DANIEL JOHNSON EXPLAINED IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE DAILY BEAST. HE FIRST TRIED TO REGISTER THE GROUP WITH THE FEC AS THE AMERICAN NATIONAL TRUMP SUPER PAC IN NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR BUT WAS PROHIBITED FROM NAMING IT THIS BECAUSE THE PAC IS NOT A COMMITTEE AUTHORIZED BY TRUMP??S CAMPAIGN. A SPOKESMAN FOR TRUMP DID NOT RESPOND FOR A REQUEST FOR COMMENT FOR THIS ARTICLE. JOHNSON SUBSEQUENTLY SUBMITTED AN AMENDED STATEMENT OF ORGANIZATION TO THE FEC ON JANUARY 6 CHANGING THE NAME TO THE AMERICAN NATIONAL SUPER PAC JUST THREE DAYS BEFORE THE CALLS BEGAN IN IOWA. HE ALSO CREATED THEDAILYTRUMP.ORG COMPLETE WITH A LOGO DEPICTING THE CANDIDATE??S SWOOPING GOLDEN LOCKS DEVOTED EXCLUSIVELY TO STORIES ABOUT TRUMP. BUT IOWANS HAVE THE PLEASURE OF HEARING NOT ONLY JOHNSON??S VOICE ON THE OPPOSITE END OF THE TELEPHONE BUT ALSO FILIPINO-AMERICAN REVEREND RONALD TAN AND JARED TAYLOR A SPOKESMAN FOR THE COUNCIL OF CONSERVATIVE CITIZENS WHICH AMONG OTHER THINGS WAS CITED AS THE GROUP WHICH INSPIRED CHARLESTON CHURCH SHOOTER DYLANN ROOF. ??I THINK REALLY IT HAS TO DO WITH A NAGGING SENSE THAT WHITE AMERICANS HAVE THAT THEIR COUNTRY IS REALLY SLIPPING THROUGH THEIR FINGERS? TAYLOR SAID WHEN ASKED WHY HE GOT INVOLVED. ??PEOPLE REALIZE THAT THE UNITED STATES IS CHANGING AND IT??S CHANGING IN A WAY THAT THEY FIND DISAGREEABLE. AND IT HAS ENORMOUSLY TO DO WITH A CHANGE IN DEMOGRAPHICS. IT??S BECOMING A THIRD-WORLD COUNTRY.? TAYLOR WHO SURMISES THAT MOST WHITE AMERICANS WANT A WHITE-ONLY NATION HAS SUNG THE PRAISES OF TRUMP IN THE PAST WRITING IN HIS OWN PUBLICATION THE AMERICAN RENAISSANCE THAT ??THIS COULD BE THE LAST CHANCE WHITES HAVE TO VOTE FOR A PRESIDENT WHO COULD ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING USEFUL FOR THEM AND FOR THEIR COUNTRY.? HE HAS ALSO CONCLUDED IN PAST WRITING THAT ??BLACKS AND WHITES ARE DIFFERENT. WHEN BLACKS ARE LEFT ENTIRELY TO THEIR OWN DEVICES WESTERN CIVILIZATION??ANY KIND OF CIVILIZATION??DISAPPEARS.? HIS ORGANIZATION IS THE MODERN ITERATION OF THE WHITE CITIZENS COUNCIL WHICH FOUGHT AGAINST DESEGREGATION IN SOUTHERN SCHOOLS IN THE 1950S AND 60S. IT HAS REFERRED TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS AS A ??RETROGRADE SPECIES OF HUMANITY? AND OPPOSES ??EFFORTS TO MIX THE RACES OF MANKIND.? TAYLOR SAID HE RECORDED HIS PART OF THE ROBOCALL UPON JOHNSON??S REQUEST AND HE WOULD CONSIDER JOINING TRUMP??S CAMPAIGN IF ASKED TO DO SO. ??IT??S MARVELOUSLY REFRESHING TO FIND A FELLA WHO SHOOTS FROM THE HIP? TAYLOR SAID DESCRIBING HIS FANDOM. ??CAN YOU IMAGINE JEB BUSH SAYING SOMETHING THAT WOULD ACTUALLY SURPRISE YOU?? SEEING AS THE PAC IS VERY NEW JOHNSON DOESN??T HAVE A LONG-TERM STRATEGY WITH IT AS OF YET. HE??S PUT IN $9000 OF HIS OWN MONEY AND IS WILLING TO PUT IN MORE DEPENDING ON HOW WELL THIS ROUND OF ROBOCALLS PERFORMS IN GETTING TRUMP AN IOWA CAUCUS WIN. ??I THINK IT??S A FOREGONE CONCLUSION THAT TRUMP WILL BE THE NOMINEE AND THE PRESIDENT? JOHNSON CONFIDENTLY SAID. ??I THINK HE WILL PROBABLY NOT WIN IOWA UNLESS MY EFFORTS ARE SUCCESSFUL.? WHILE THESE CALLS MIGHT RING AS UNWANTED AND RIDDLED WITH PROBLEMATIC LANGUAGE TO IOWA VOTERS THE FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION??S HANDS ARE REALLY TIED WHEN IT COMES TO DEALING WITH THE CONTENT OF ROBOCALLS. ACCORDING TO DEPUTY PRESS OFFICER CHRISTIAN HILLAND THE ONLY TIME THAT THE FEC IS MADE AWARE OF THE EXISTENCE OF ROBOCALLS IS WHEN A PAC SPENDS $10000 OR MORE AND HAS TO FILE AN INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURE REPORT. ??THAT WOULD BE BEYOND THE SCOPE OF OUR REGULATIONS? HILLAND SAID WHEN ASKED IF THE FEC WOULD POLICE ANY UNSAVORY CONTENT IN POLITICAL ROBOCALLS. ??YOU??D PROBABLY HAVE TO LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE THE DOJ.? THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE DID NOT RESPOND TO A REQUEST FOR COMMENT ABOUT WHETHER IT HAD BEEN MADE AWARE OF THE CONTENT OF THESE CALLS. GEOFF GREENWOOD COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR THE IOWA ATTORNEY GENERAL TOLD THE DAILY BEAST THAT ??THERE??S NO SCREENING PROCESS? WHEN IT COMES TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF POLITICAL ROBOCALLS IN THE STATE. ACCORDING TO FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION STANDARDS THE CALLS ARE QUALIFIED AS PROTECTED FREE SPEECH IF THEY GO TO A LANDLINE. IF A CELL PHONE RECEIVES THE CALLS THE USER HAS TO HAVE GIVEN EXPRESS PERMISSION TO RECEIVES CALLS AT THAT NUMBER. A REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE FCC TOLD THE DAILY BEAST THAT DETAILS OF ANY COMPLAINTS COULD ONLY BE OBTAINED THROUGH THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT. BUT AT LEAST ONE EXPERT SAID THAT THE CONTENT OF THE CALLS COULD STOKE HATRED AMONG LISTENERS. ??THESE ROBOCALLS ARE TOO BRIEF TO ENGAGE IN A COMPLICATED CRITIQUE OF THEIR USE OF HATE? DR. MICHAEL S. WALTMAN A PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA WHO SPECIALIZES IN HATE SPEECH TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. ??BUT THEY DO MANIPULATE THE HATRED OF POTENTIAL LISTENERS. JARED TAYLOR??S COMMENTS DIRECTLY STATE THAT MUSLIMS ARE NOT GOOD FOR AMERICA AND THAT THEY ARE NOT GOOD FOR AMERICA BECAUSE THEY ARE MUSLIMS (HE EVEN SUGGESTS THAT MUSLIMS ARE NOT WELL-EDUCATED WHEN HE CLAIMS THAT WE SHOULD ONLY ADMIT WELL EDUCATED PEOPLE TO THE COUNTRY).? THERE ARE NO LEGAL LIMITS IF JOHNSON WANTS TO EXPAND THESE CALLS TO NEW HAMPSHIRE WHICH IS SOMETHING HE??S CONSIDERING UNLESS SOMEONE FILES A COMPLAINT WITH THE FCC. WHICH MEANS THERE COULD BE A LOT MORE OF JOHNSON AND HIS FRIENDS THROUGHOUT THE MONTH AS THE FIRST PRIMARY NEARS. THOSE FRIENDS INCLUDE REVEREND RONALD TAN WHO IMMIGRATED TO THE UNITED STATES IN THE 1980S AND NOW SUPPORTS TRUMP??S IMMIGRATION POLICIES. ??I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST BUILDING THE WALL? TAN TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. ??THERE??S A LOT OF DANGER RIGHT NOW WITH AN OPEN-ENDED POLICY. I REALLY WANT TO SAFEGUARD THE PROCESS IN TERMS OF MORE STRINGENT BACKGROUND CHECKS. IT??S VERY DIFFICULT GIVEN THE KIND OF WORLD THAT WE LIVE IN RIGHT NOW WHERE TERRORISM AND RADICAL ISLAM HAS PERMEATED EVEN SOCIAL MEDIA.? TAN WHO SAID THAT HE GETS INVITED TO CHURCHES ??ALL THE TIME? HAS NO SPECIFIC PLACE OF MINISTRY AND RATHER PRACTICES IT ??THROUGH A RADIO PROGRAM? AT THE MOMENT. THAT SHOW CALLED ??FOR GOD AND COUNTRY? AND CO-HOSTED BY JOHNSON IS SET TO AIR ON AN IOWA RADIO STATION FROM JANUARY 12-JANUARY 22 IN ORDER TO PROVIDE VOTERS WITH ??CHRISTIAN AND NATIONALIST REASONS TO SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP? ACCORDING TO A PRESS RELEASE FROM THE AMERICAN FREEDOM PARTY. FOR NOW THIS RAGTAG GROUP OF WHITE NATIONALISTS CAN ONLY HOPE THAT THEY ARE PLAYING A PART IN WHAT THEY VIEW AS A HISTORICAL MOMENT IN AMERICAN POLITICS. ??IF YOU WERE BORN IN THE UNITED STATES AND SUDDENLY FIND THAT YOU ARE LIVING IN AN OUTPOST OF GUATEMALA OR HAITI OR NICARAGUA OR VIETNAM YOU??RE GOING TO BE ANGRY? TAYLOR SAID DESCRIBING THE CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE COUNTRY. IN TRUMP VOTERS ??SEE A MAN WHO SAYS ??HOLD ON LET??S LOOK OVER SOME OF THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING. MAYBE SOME OF THEM ARE RAPISTS. MAYBE SOME OF THEM ARE MURDERERS. MAYBE SOME OF THESE MUSLIMS REALLY ARE UNDESIRABLES. SIMPLY HAVING SAID THAT IS A HUGE EARTHQUAKE IN AMERICAN POLITICS.? ,57068.0

SHE RESEARCHED THE ISSUE AND FOLLOWED UP SAYS JOE GRANDMAISON THE FORMER DEMOCRATIC PARTY STATE CHAIR IN NEW HAMPSHIRE WHO CROWNED BILL CLINTON THE ??COMEBACK KID? AFTER HIS SECOND-PLACE FINISH IN THE 1992 PRIMARY. AN UNABASHED HILLARY FAN GRANDMAISON OBSERVED THAT HER DILIGENCE ON THE ADDICTION ISSUE RECALLED THE ??LISTENING TOUR? CLINTON TOOK WHEN SHE FIRST RAN FOR THE SENATE FROM NEW YORK IN 2000. ??YOU DON??T HAVE TO BE TERRIBLY CYNICAL TO THINK IT IS MOSTLY A PUBLIC RELATIONS TOUR BUT HILLARY DEMONSTRATED JUST THE OPPOSITE? GRANDMAISON TOLD ME. ??HELPING PEOPLE IN THIS WAY IS WHO SHE IS AND IT??S BETTER POLITICS THAN NORMAL BECAUSE IT CUTS RIGHT THROUGH THE CYNICISM.? GRANDMAISON HAD JUST RETURNED FROM A CLINTON EVENT IN PORTSMOUTH WHEN I REACHED HIM ON THE PHONE. IT WAS COLD AND SNOWY AND HE HAD WAITED 40 MINUTES IN LINE TO GET IN BUT HE WAS STILL CHUCKLING OVER THE LITTLE BOY WHO TOLD CLINTON HIS MOMMY DOESN??T MAKE AS MUCH MONEY AS HIS DADDY ??AND THAT??S NOT FAIR BECAUSE SHE WORKS HARDER THAN HE DOES.? THAT ELICITED LOTS OF KNOWING LAUGHTER ALONG WITH CLINTON??S STANDARD ANSWER ABOUT EQUAL PAY.

WHAT DID SINGH DO THAT MADE THIS MAN WANT TO BEAT HIM UP? SINGH HAD SIMPLY OBJECTED TO DONALD TRUMP??S MUSLIM BASHING AT A CAMPAIGN RALLY SUNDAY IN MUSCATINE IOWA. SINGH IS A BRAVE SOUL AND A BEAUTIFUL REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SIKH FAITH. HE WENT INTO THE BELLY OF THE BEAST??A TRUMP RALLY ??WEARING HIS TRADITIONAL SIKH TURBAN AND SPORTING A BEARD BOTH CONSIDERED ARTICLES OF FAITH TO SIKHS. SINGH ISN??T MUSLIM. IN FACT MANY SIKHS HAVE BEEN ASSAULTED IN RECENT YEARS BY BIGOTS WHO THOUGHT THEY WERE MUSLIMS WITH OVER 700 ATTACKS RECORDED SINCE 9/11 IN THE UNITED STATES INCLUDING MURDERS. BUT AS SINGH EXPLAINED TO ME ??SOCIAL JUSTICE AND DEFENDING PEOPLE IN NEED IS PART OF THE SIKH FAITH. YOU DON??T HAVE TO BE A MUSLIM TO STAND AGAINST ANTI-MUSLIM BIGOTRY. EVERYONE SHOULD STAND UP AGAINST BIGOTRY AND HATE REGARDLESS OF THE TARGET.? SINGH WAS NOT ONLY UPSET WITH TRUMP??S DEMONIZING OF MUSLIMS BUT THE FACT THAT RECENTLY A MUSLIM WOMAN WEARING A HIJAB WAS EJECTED FROM A TRUMP RALLY FOR SIMPLY STANDING UP IN SILENT PROTEST. SINGH FELT COMPELLED TO DO SOMETHING. AND SO SINGH SET OUT SUNDAY NIGHT TO DO JUST THAT. SINGH WHO WAS BORN AND RAISED IN IOWA BUT WHO NOW SPLITS HIS TIME BETWEEN THE HAWKEYE STATE AND CHICAGO SET OUT WITH HIS FRIEND TAYLOR WILLIAMS TO ATTEND SUNDAY??S TRUMP RALLY. THEY HAD WRITTEN TWO SIMPLE WORDS ON A BIG WHITE SHEET: ??STOP HATE.? SINGH PLANNED TO UNFURL THIS SIGN IF TRUMP ENGAGED IN DEMONIZING ANY MINORITY GROUPS. BUT WITH TRUMP IT??S NOT REALLY A QUESTION OF IF BUT WHEN. SO ABOUT 20 MINUTES INTO TRUMP??S SPEECH HE BEGAN HIS RECITATION OF HOW SCARY MUSLIMS WERE. HE PAINTED A PICTURE THAT MUSLIMS??EVEN MUSLIM AMERICANS??WERE ALL A POTENTIAL THREAT WHO COULD AT ANY MOMENT SHOOT EVEN THEIR FRIENDS. THAT IS WHEN SINGH YELLED OUT: ??WHY DO YOU GIVE SHELTER TO WHITE SUPREMACISTS?!? HE THEN OPENED UP THE SHEET. WITHIN SECONDS SECURITY AND A TRUMP AIDE GRABBED SINGH AND BEGAN ESCORTING HIM TO THE DOOR. TRUMP CAN THEN BE HEARD BELLOWING ??BYE!??GOODBYE!? AS THE CROWD CHEERED IN UNISON: ??TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP!? WHILE BEING PHYSICALLY REMOVED FROM THE VENUE SINGH FEARED THAT THE ANGRY CHANTING CROWD COULD ??DESCEND UPON? HIM AT ANY MOMENT. IT WAS TENSE. AND ONCE SINGH WAS OUTSIDE THE AUDITORIUM AND STANDING IN THE STAIRWELL THAT??S WHEN THE ANGRY WHITE MAN THREATENED TO BEAT HIM UP. UNSURPRISINGLY THE THREAT WAS DIRECTED ONLY AT SINGH NOT TO HIS WHITE FRIEND WILLIAMS WHO WAS AT THAT TIME THE ONE HOLDING THE ??STOP HATE? SIGN. THE LOCAL POLICE THEN ESCORTED SINGH AND WILLIAMS OUT OF THE VENUE WHERE THE POLICE THREATENED TO CHARGE THE TWO WITH ??INCITING A RIOT.? YOU SEE INTERRUPTING TRUMP COULD INSPIRE VIOLENCE AS WE SAW A FEW MONTHS AGO WHEN TRUMP??S WHITE SUPPORTERS BEAT UP A BLACK PROTESTER WHILE CALLING THE MAN A ??MONKEY? AND THE N-WORD. AND EVEN WORSE TRUMP PUBLICLY DEFENDED THIS ASSAULT ON FOX NEWS. SO WHO KNOWS WHAT TRUMP SUPPORTERS COULD DO IF THEY GET EVEN ANGRIER OR TRUMP SUGGESTS THEY DO SOMETHING? MEANWHILE BACK IN THE VENUE TRUMP MADE A JOKE WHICH SEEMED TO BE TARGETING SINGH??S RELIGIOUS TURBAN. TRUMP COMMENTED TO THE CROWD ??HE WASN??T WEARING ONE OF THOSE HATS WAS HE?? I KNOW THERE??S A DEBATE OVER WHETHER TRUMP WAS MOCKING SINGH??S TURBAN OR NOT BUT GIVEN TRUMP??S RECENT HISTORY OF HATEFUL COMMENTS DIRECTED AT LATINOS AND MUSLIMS AND HIS DEFENDING THE ASSAULT OF A BLACK PROTESTER AT THIS POINT IT??S CERTAINLY FAIR TO ASSUME TRUMP WAS AGAIN MOCKING A MINORITY TO THE DELIGHT OF HIS WHITE SUPPORTERS. I ASKED SINGH WHO IS A WRITER AND A COMEDIAN WHY HE CHOOSE TO YELL OUT SPECIFICALLY ABOUT TRUMP GIVING SHELTER TO WHITE SUPREMACISTS? SINGH EXPLAINED THAT HE WAS GREATLY ALARMED THAT WHITE SUPREMACISTS HAD OPENLY BEEN CALLING VOTERS TO SUPPORT TRUMP IN IOWA AND THAT TRUMP HAD FAILED TO DENOUNCE THESE HATE MONGERS. IN THOSE PRERECORDED PHONE MESSAGES A WELL-KNOWN WHITE SUPREMACIST LEADER URGED VOTERS IN IOWA TO SUPPORT TRUMP BECAUSE TRUMP UNDERSTOOD THAT ??WE NEED SMART WELL-EDUCATED WHITE PEOPLE WHO WILL ASSIMILATE TO OUR CULTURE.? AND TRUMP HAS BEEN A BOON TO WHITE SUPREMACIST GROUPS WHICH HAVE SEEN A ??TRUMP BUMP? IN MEMBERSHIP BECAUSE THEY ARE EXCITED BY HIS HATEFUL CAMPAIGN RHETORIC DIRECTED AT MINORITIES. SINGH FEARS THAT TRUMP??S WORDS COULD DO MORE THAN EMBOLDEN HATERS??THEY COULD INSPIRE VIOLENCE. HE POINTED TO THE LATINO IMMIGRANT BEATEN UP IN AUGUST BY ??PASSIONATE? TRUMP SUPPORTERS IN BOSTON AS AN EXAMPLE. AND SINGH EXPRESSED HIS CONCERN THAT TRUMP COULD FOSTER A CLIMATE THAT COULD LEAD TO MORE SIKHS BEING ATTACKED OR EVEN KILLED SUCH AS IN 2012 WHEN A SELF-PROCLAIMED WHITE SUPREMACIST SHOT AND KILLED SIX SIKHS IN A SIKH TEMPLE LOCATED IN OAK CREEK WISCONSIN. ??IT??S SCARIER TODAY FOR KIDS GROWING UP WHO WEAR A TURBAN OR WHO LOOK MUSLIM THAN WHEN I WAS A KID? SINGH NOTED. HE EXPLAINED THAT EVEN IN CHICAGO WHICH IS A DIVERSE CITY JUST LAST WEEK SOMEONE CALLED HIM A ??TERRORIST? WHILE HE WAS WALKING ALONG THE SIDEWALK. BEING PHYSICALLY THROWN OUT OF A VENUE WHILE BEING MOCKED AND THREATENED BY ANGRY TRUMP SUPPORTERS AND RIDICULED BY TRUMP MAY DISSUADE SOME BUT NOT SINGH. HE??S PLANNING TO DO EVEN MORE COMMENTING THAT ??TRUMP IS EMBOLDENING RIGHT-WING WHITE SUPREMACY AND A RESPONSE IS NEEDED EVEN IF THAT MEANS I??M ARRESTED FOR CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE IN CALLING IT OUT.? IT??S PEOPLE LIKE SINGH NOT TRUMP WHO MAKE AMERICA GREAT.

WRITER-DIRECTORS MOIRA DEMOS AND LAURA RICCIARDI SPENT A DECADE WHITTLING DOWN OVER 700 HOURS OF FOOTAGE TO CRAFT THE DOCUSERIES THAT??S TURNED VIEWERS INTO INTERNET-SLEUTHING CONSPIRACY THEORISTS SINCE IT HIT THE STREAMING SERVICE ON DECEMBER 18??AND EVEN THEY STILL WRESTLE WITH THE BIG QUESTION: DID AVERY DO IT? ??WHAT I LEARNED FROM MAKING THIS SERIES IS THE HUMILITY TO ACCEPT THAT I DON??T KNOW AND I MAY NEVER KNOW? DEMOS TOLD THE DAILY BEAST OVER THE HOLIDAY BREAK THAT SHE AND RICCIARDI PROPERLY HIJACKED FILLING NEWSFEEDS AND SOCIAL MEDIA STREAMS WITH THE SHOCKED ANGRY AND OUTRAGED REACTIONS OF VIEWERS MAKING THEIR WAY THROUGH MAKING A MURDERER. ??THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS WE LEARNED DOING THIS: JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE QUESTIONS DOESN??T MEAN THAT YOU??RE GOING TO GET AN ANSWER? SHE SAID. ??IF YOU??RE SO COMMITTED TO FINDING THE TRUTH AND FINDING THE ANSWER IT??S VERY HARD TO BE COMFORTABLE WITH AMBIGUITY AND YOU??LL OFTEN SETTLE JUST FOR SOME FINALITY.? THE DIRECTORS WERE NYC GRADUATE FILM STUDENTS WHEN THE SAGA OF STEVEN AVERY FIRST CAUGHT THEIR ATTENTIONS SPLASHED ACROSS NATIONAL NEWS HEADLINES. AVERY A WORKING CLASS LOCAL WITH A RECORD FROM MANITOWOC COUNTY WISCONSIN HAD BEEN EXONERATED BY DNA TESTING IN 2003 AFTER SPENDING 18 YEARS IN PRISON FOR A RAPE HE DIDN??T COMMIT. TWO YEARS LATER AVERY WAS A HIGH PROFILE PEBBLE IN THE SHOE OF THE MANITOWOC COUNTY SHERIFF??S DEPARTMENT WHICH HE WAS SUING FOR $36 MILLION??THE SAME AUTHORITIES WHO EAGERLY LOCKED HIM AWAY AGAIN WHEN THE MURDER OF A LOCAL WOMAN LED THEM RIGHT BACK TO AVERY??S DOOR. AFTER READING A STORY IN THE NEW YORK TIMES ABOUT AVERY??S PLIGHT FILMMAKING (AND ROMANTIC) PARTNERS DEMOS AND RICCIARDI BORROWED A CAMERA AND HIT THE ROAD TO MANITOWOC COUNTY IN A RENTAL SET ON STAYING FOR A WEEK TO DOCUMENT AVERY??S TRIAL. AS THE CASE WORE ON THEY MOVED IN TO TEMPORARY DIGS IN TOWN SCORING KEY ACCESS TO AVERY??S BELEAGUERED FAMILY BY WRITING A LETTER TO AVERY WHO GAVE HIS BLESSING FROM BEHIND BARS. THE TRIAL LASTED SIX WEEKS AND TOOK AN UNEXPECTED TURN WHEN CALUMET COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY KEN KRATZ HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE THAT THREW A SENSATIONAL WRENCH INTO THE CASE AND INTO DEMOS AND RICCIARDI??S PLANS JUST AS THEY WERE PACKING UP TO HEAD HOME. AVERY??S 16-YEAR-OLD NEPHEW BRENDAN DASSEY WAS ARRESTED FOUR MONTHS AFTER HIS UNCLE HAVING IMPLICATED HIMSELF IN THE RAPE AND MURDER OF HALBACH. TAPED FOOTAGE OF HIS CONFESSION PROVIDES MAKING A MURDERER WITH ONE OF ITS MORE TROUBLING ELEMENTS SUGGESTING THAT DASSEY WAS RAILROADED BY INVESTIGATORS AND HIS OWN COUNSEL INTO SPINNING A FANTASY VERSION OF THE HALBACH MURDER AFTER REPEATEDLY DENYING HIS INVOLVEMENT IN THE CRIME. ??ONE OF THE THINGS I HOPE VIEWERS WHO REALLY ENGAGE WITH THE SERIES WILL TAKE AWAY FROM THIS IS THIS QUESTION OF IF THEY HAVE LINGERING QUESTIONS ARE THEY COMFORTABLE LIVING WITH THAT?? SAID RICCIARDI. ??THERE ARE NOW TWO PEOPLE WHO ARE BEHIND BARS PROBABLY FOR LIFE. DO OUR VIEWERS FEEL SATISFIED WITH THE PROCESS THAT LED TO THOSE CONVICTIONS?? THE FILMMAKERS HAD NO IDEA HOW VAST THE SCOPE OF THEIR FILM WOULD GROW WHEN THEY FIRST BEGAN THE PROJECT SEEING IN IT A PROVOCATIVE CASE STUDY OF HOW THE AMERICAN LEGAL SYSTEM TREATED ONE MAN TWICE ACCUSED. ??HERE WAS A MAN WHO IN 1985 WAS WRONGED BY THE SYSTEM? RICCIARDI REMEMBERED. ??IT FAILED HIM AND HERE HE WAS 20 YEARS LATER PULLED BACK IN. THE QUESTION REALLY WAS HAD THERE BEEN ANY MEANINGFUL PROGRESS WITHIN THOSE 20 YEARS? WOULD THE SYSTEM BE ANY MORE RELIABLE IN 2005 THAN IT WAS IN 1985?? IN 2003 ADVANCES IN DNA TESTING EXONERATED AVERY OF THE RAPE OF PENNY BEERNSTEN. BUT IN 2005 AFTER SCIENCE SAVED HIM ONCE IT DAMNED HIM AS PROSECUTORS LEANED HEAVILY ON FBI LABORATORY TESTING FOR A SUBSTANCE CALLED EDTA IN A BLOOD SAMPLE THAT AVERY??S DEFENSE ARGUED HAD BEEN TAMPERED WITH. ??I THINK IT REALLY BEGS THE QUESTION OF THE ROLE OF SCIENCE IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM? SAID DEMOS. ??OUR SYSTEM IS MADE UP OF HUMAN BEINGS AND HUMAN BEINGS ARE MUDDY AND COMPLEX AND FLAWED AS WE ALL KNOW. SCIENCE IS THIS VERY TEMPTING BLACK AND WHITE SORT OF THING. IT??S TEMPTING TO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS WHAT SOME REFER TO AS A ??TRUTH METER.?? YOU HAVE DNA AND WE OFTEN GET ASKED ??WAS THERE DNA EVIDENCE PROVING HE DID IT??? WE LIKE TO THINK THAT ANY KIND OF EVIDENCE WHETHER IT BE DNA EVIDENCE OR ANY OTHER KIND WOULD JUST BE THE BEGINNING OF THE INQUIRY NOT THE END OF IT.? ??I REMEMBER IN THIS PROCESS BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND THAT SCIENCE AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE IT??S VERY DANGEROUS TO PUT THEM TOGETHER? DEMOS CONTINUED. ??OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS BASED ON A PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE UNTIL YOU??RE PROVEN GUILTY??WHEREAS IN SCIENCE SOMETHING IS TRUE UNTIL IT??S DISPROVED. SO IT??S EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE. WE HAVE ONE KIND OF TEST AFTER ANOTHER THAT USED TO BE RELIED UPON BEING REVEALED TO BE NOT SO RELIABLE AND THERE??S A PROBLEM THERE.? SOME HAVE WONDERED WHY AVERY??S DEFENSE DIDN??T FIGHT HARDER TO DISCREDIT THE FBI??S EDTA TESTING A METHOD THAT HAD BEEN USED TEN YEARS PRIOR IN THE O.J. SIMPSON CASE. BUT AS AVERY LAMENTS TO HIS MOTHER DOLORES BY PHONE EARLY IN THE SERIES ??POOR PEOPLE LOSE ALL THE TIME.? IF AVERY??S TEAM HAD AS MANY RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THEM AS THE STATE HAD AT THEIR DISPOSAL DEMOS SAYS THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PUT THE FBI??S TEST UNDER MORE SCRUTINY. INSTEAD ??THE ONLY THING THE DEFENSE WAS IN A POSITION TO DO WAS ANALYZE THE DATA COMING OUT OF THE FBI LABS? SHE SAID. ??THEY DIDN??T HAVE THE FUNDS. THE FBI IS A HUGE RESOURCE THAT THE STATE WAS GIVEN??IT WOULD HAVE COST TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.? ??IN ONE INTERVIEW THAT DIDN??T END UP IN THE SERIES [AVERY DEFENSE ATTORNEY] JERRY [BUTING] TALKS ABOUT HOW THEY WOULD HAVE BASICALLY HAD TO GO TO A UNIVERSITY LAB ASK THEM TO DO A RESEARCH PROJECT TO FIND OUT ABOUT DEGRADATION IN EDTA ALL OF THESE THINGS? DEMOS EXPLAINED. ??SO REALLY SCIENCE WAS NOT AT THE PLACE WHERE IT COULD BE USED TO TEST THIS??AND YET IT WAS PRESENTED IN COURT.? MAKING A MURDERER SHEDS A LIGHT ON AVERY??S CASE AS HIS DEFENSE TEAM OF BUTING AND CO-COUNSEL DEAN STRANG MOUNT AN IMPASSIONED CASE FOR THEIR CLIENT IN AND OUT OF COURT LETTING THE FILMMAKERS DOCUMENT THEIR PROGRESS AS WELL AS THEIR FRUSTRATIONS WITH THE CASE THE HEADLINE-HUNGRY MEDIA AND THE PUBLIC SERVANTS WHO FAIL AND FOIL AVERY AND DASSEY TIME AND AGAIN. THE UNASSUMING MIDDLE-AGED LAWYERS WITH KILLER COURTROOM SWAG AND ELOQUENT QUOTABLES HAVE BECOME MODERN-DAY ATTICUS FINCHES FOR THE MILLENNIAL GENERATION NOBLE DEFENDERS OF JUSTICE WHO HAVE UNEXPECTEDLY AMASSED FERVENT FAN FOLLOWINGS OF THEIR OWN. ??WE HAVE SOME SENSE OF THAT? RICCIARDI LAUGHED. ??SOMETIMES PEOPLE EMAIL OR TWEET THINGS TO US.? SHE CREDITS STRANG AND BUTING WITH INFUSING MAKING A MURDERER WITH THE STREAK OF PRINCIPLED OUTRAGE THAT MARKS THE SERIES. IT??S EASY TO SEE HOW THE DYNAMIC DUO HAVE RUBBED OFF ON VIEWERS WITH HEARTFELT LINES LIKE THOSE UTTERED BY STRANG WHO REACTED TO AVERY??S 2005 CONVICTION BY LAMENTING ??REDEMPTION WILL HAVE TO WAIT AS IT SO OFTEN DOES IN HUMAN AFFAIRS.? ??THERE ARE WAYS IN WHICH PEOPLE HAVE ASKED US ??IS THIS SERIES BIASED? IS IT ONE-SIDED???? SHE SAID. ??WHAT I WOULD SAY IN RESPONSE TO THAT IS THAT WE HAD VERY ARTICULATE SUBJECTS ON THE DEFENSE SIDE. THEY WERE PASSIONATE. THEY BELIEVED IN THEIR CLIENT. AND THEY WERE IN A POSITION TO ADVANCE THIS THEORY THAT THEIR CLIENT HAD BEEN FRAMED AND FRAMED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. SO YES WE DOCUMENTED THAT. YES IT??S IN THE SERIES. BUT THAT WAS THEIR OPINION AND THEIR ROLE AS ADVOCATES THAT WE SIMPLY SHOWED.? BUT DON??T MISTAKE STRANG AND BUTING??S PERSPECTIVE FOR THE FILMMAKERS?? SHE CAUTIONS: ??IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE ADOPTED IT OR THAT OUR INTERESTS WERE COMPLETELY ALIGNED WITH THEIRS.? ALTHOUGH DEMOS AND RICCIARDI CAREFULLY GUARD THEIR THOUGHTS ON AVERY AND DASSEY??S GUILT OR INNOCENCE IN INTERVIEWS AT TIMES IN THE TEN-HOUR SERIES ONE MIGHT INFER THE FILMMAKERS?? REAL SENTIMENTS IN HOW THEY FRAME THE COLORFUL CAST OF LOCAL REPORTERS PRESENT AT TRIAL. AN INCREDULOUS PRESS CONFERENCE INQUIRY HERE A TELLING SIDE-EYE GLANCE THERE. MAKING A MURDERER CONDEMNS THE BREATHLESS MEDIA REPORTING OF LOCAL AND NATIONAL NEWS ORGANIZATIONS FOR THEIR ROLE IN ENSURING THAT AVERY AND DASSEY COULDN??T POSSIBLY FIND AN UNTAINTED JURY POOL OF THEIR PEERS EVEN AS DEMOS AND RICCIARDI PRESENT THE LOCAL REPORTERS THEY WORKED ALONGSIDE FOR MONTHS AS A GREEK CHORUS FOIL TO THE PROSECUTION. ??THE REPORTERS VERY MUCH ARE WINDOW CHARACTERS? SAID DEMOS OF THE PRESS POOL WHICH HAD ONLY HEARD THE STATE??S VERSION OF EVENTS UNTIL THE DEFENSE LAUNCHED THEIR ARGUMENTS AT TRIAL. ??THE COURTROOM WAS THE FIRST PLACE THEY WERE HEARING THE DEFENSE. THEY WERE VERY GRACIOUS AND VERY OPEN TO COLLABORATING WITH US BUT AT THE SAME TIME THEY WERE ALSO PART OF THE STORY. AND YET THEY HAD A DIFFERENT JOB TO DO AND DIFFERENT ACCESS??THEY HAD ACCESS TO THE STATE BUT THEY DIDN??T HAVE ACCESS TO THE FAMILY SO IT??S A DIFFERENT STORY THAT EMERGES.? THEN THERE??S KRATZ THE OFT-SMUG PORTLY DISTRICT ATTORNEY WHO EASILY EMERGES AS MAKING A MURDERER??S VILLAINOUS MUSTACHE-TWIRLING PERSONIFICATION OF THE MAN. KRATZ DECLINED TO BE INTERVIEWED FOR THE FILM AND EARNS A MEMORABLE CODA WHEN THE SERIES NOTES THE UNRELATED SEX SCANDAL THAT GOT HIM FIRED AFTER THE AVERY CASE. HE PUBLICLY DECRIED THE SERIES AFTER ITS DEBUT AND AFTER IRATE FANS BOMBED HIS YELP PAGE WITH NEGATIVE REVIEWS. MORE POINTEDLY HE TOOK TO THE MEDIA TO SLAM DEMOS AND RICCIARDI FOR NOT INCLUDING CRUCIAL EVIDENCE IN THEIR FILM THAT HELPED A JURY CONVICT AVERY. ??YOU DON'T WANT TO MUDDY UP A PERFECTLY GOOD CONSPIRACY MOVIE WITH WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED AND CERTAINLY NOT PROVIDE THE AUDIENCE WITH THE EVIDENCE THE JURY CONSIDERED TO REJECT THAT CLAIM? KRATZ TOLD PEOPLE CITING EVIDENCE HE PRESENTED IN COURT INCLUDING *67 CALLS AVERY MADE TO HALBACH AND HER REPORTED DISCOMFORT AT VISITING THE AVERY SALVAGE YARD AFTER AN INCIDENT IN WHICH AVERY ALLEGEDLY ANSWERED THE DOOR IN A TOWEL. WHILE IN PRISON FOR THE 1985 RAPE HE WAS LATER CLEARED OF AVERY ??TOLD ANOTHER INMATE OF HIS INTENT TO BUILD A ??TORTURE CHAMBER?? SO HE COULD RAPE TORTURE AND KILL YOUNG WOMEN WHEN HE WAS RELEASED? KRATZ SAID. ??HE EVEN DREW A DIAGRAM.? ??WE WROTE A LETTER TO KEN KRATZ SAYING WHO WE WERE AND THAT WE WERE INTERESTED IN INCLUDING AS MANY POINTS OF VIEW AS POSSIBLE IN THE SERIES? RICCIARDI SAID. ??WE OFFERED [KRATZ] THE OPPORTUNITY. WE OFFERED IT TO THE HALBACH FAMILY. WE OFFERED IT TO PENNY BEERNSTEN WHO WAS THE VICTIM IN THE 1985 CASE TOM KOCOUREK WHO WAS THE SHERIFF DENNIS VOGEL AND OTHER MEMBERS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT.? DEMOS AND RICCIARDI SAY TIME CONSTRAINTS MADE IT NECESSARY TO FOCUS ONLY ON THE EVIDENCE INTRODUCED IN COURT THAT THEY DEEMED TO BE MOST CRUCIAL TO KRATZ??S CASE AGAINST AVERY. ??THERE WERE CLEAR PIECES OF EVIDENCE THAT THE STATE WAS HANGING THEIR CASE ON??THE MOST INCRIMINATING PIECES OF EVIDENCE WHETHER IT WAS THAT [HALBACH??S] CAR WAS FOUND ON THE AVERY SALVAGE PROPERTY OR THAT HER BURNED REMAINS WERE FOUND IN THE BURN PIT OUTSIDE OF HIS WINDOW OR A BULLET FRAGMENT IN HIS GARAGE THAT HAD TERESA??S DNA ON IT? RICCIARDI ARGUED CITING THE LIMITED SCREEN TIME SHE AND DEMOS PLANNED TO DEVOTE TO THE HALBACH TRIAL. ??IN THE THREE OR SO HOURS WE HAD TO COVER THE TRIAL WE HAD TO PICK WHAT WE PERCEIVED TO BE THE STATE AND THE PROSECUTION??S MOST INCRIMINATING EVIDENCE AGAINST STEVEN. AND THOSE ARE WHAT WE PUT IN THE SERIES.? ??I THINK ANY OF THE [PIECES OF EVIDENCE NOT INCLUDED IN THE SERIES] ARE LESS INCRIMINATING THAN ANY ONE OF THE THINGS I JUST LISTED? SHE ADDED. ??AS FILMMAKERS AND AS STORYTELLERS IT??S IN OUR INTEREST TO SHOW CONFLICT AND TO SHOW THE STRENGTHS OF THE STATE??S CASE THEN SHOW THE DEFENSE??S ARGUMENTS AGAINST IT. THAT WAS HOW WE STRUCTURED THINGS.? THE FILMMAKERS MAINTAIN THAT THE AVERY CASE WAS NEVER AS CUT-AND-DRIED AS KRATZ WOULD STILL HAVE THE PUBLIC BELIEVE. ??I WOULD ADD THAT IN CLOSING ARGUMENTS KEN KRATZ ARGUED TO THE JURY ??THIS CASE IS CLEAR. THERE??S ONLY ONE REASONABLE OUTCOME??? RICCIARDI SAID. ??DEAN STRANG??S RETORT WAS ??NOTHING IN THIS CASE IS CLEAR.??? SINCE DEBUTING ON NETFLIX MAKING A MURDERER HAS INCENSED VIEWERS INTO ACTION SPARKING SEVERAL METICULOUSLY DETAILED SUBREDDITS DEDICATED TO THE AVERY AND DASSEY CASES AND SPURRING RUMORS THAT HACKER GROUP ANONYMOUS MIGHT UNLEASH THE ELUSIVE PIECES OF EVIDENCE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY EXONERATE THE TWO MEN WHO ARE SERVING LIFE SENTENCES FOR THE HALBACH MURDER. A WHITEHOUSE.GOV PETITION CALLING FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA TO PARDON THE MEN BASED ON THE NETFLIX SERIES HAS GARNERED OVER 15000 SIGNATURES WHILE A CHANGE.ORG PETITION HAS 82000 AND COUNTING. STRANG ELOQUENT AS EVER IN RECENT INTERVIEWS SAYS THAT THE AVERY CASE STILL HAUNTS HIM??AND THAT THE RELEASE OF THE SERIES HAS GENERATED NEW LEADS THAT COULD GIVE AVERY A SECOND CHANCE??AGAIN. MAKING A MURDERER MANIA HAS ALSO LED TO THE PROLIFERATION OF CONSPIRACY THEORIES ABOUT WHO REALLY KILLED HALBACH AND WHETHER SHADY SCHEMING ON THE PARTS OF FRIENDS AND FAMILY OF BOTH HALBACH AND AVERY CONTRIBUTED EITHER TO HER DEATH OR THE PLANTING OF EVIDENCE ORCHESTRATED TO FRAME AVERY. AT FIRST DEMOS AND RICCIARDI CHUCKLE AT THE THOUGHT OF INCENSED VIEWERS DEEP-DIVING DOWN ONLINE RABBIT HOLES HELL-BENT ON UNCOVERING THE TRUTH OF WHAT HAPPENED THE AFTERNOON OF HALLOWEEN 2005 WHEN HALBACH DISAPPEARED AFTER VISITING AVERY??S FAMILY SALVAGE YARD ON ASSIGNMENT FOR AUTO TRADER MAGAZINE. BUT MAKING A MURDERER FANATICS HAVE DUG MORE DEEPLY INTO THE CASE THAN THE FILMMAKERS EVER ANTICIPATED AND THE SERIES?? ARGUABLE EMPATHY FOR THE AVERY CLAN HAS BROUGHT MORE THAN JUST KRATZ INTO THE INTERNET??S SIGHTS. THE DIRECTORS VERY SERIOUSLY CAUTION AGAINST IMPASSIONED VIEWERS JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS TO INDICT ANY OF THE ??CHARACTERS? OF MAKING A MURDERER IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION OR OTHERWISE. ??WE ALWAYS HOPED THAT THERE WOULD BE VIEWER ENGAGEMENT WE JUST HAD NO IDEA THAT PEOPLE WOULD BECOME AMATEUR SLEUTHS? SAID DEMOS. ??I GUESS IT??S JUST THE TIMES WE??RE LIVING IN. BUT IN TERMS OF PEOPLE ZEROING IN ON PARTICULAR INDIVIDUALS WE WOULD JUST ASK THAT PEOPLE CHECK THEMSELVES BECAUSE PART OF THE PROBLEM WE SAW??NOT ONLY IN THE 1985 CASE BUT I WOULD ARGUE AS WELL IN THE 2005 CASE??WAS AN INCREDIBLE RUSH TO JUDGMENT. AND MEMBERS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE NOT THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO CAN DO THAT AND MAKE THAT MISTAKE.? SHE AND RICCIARDI ARE HEARTENED BY THE EMOTIONAL REACTION VIEWERS HAVE HAD TO THE STORY OF AVERY DASSEY HALBACH AND THEIR TORMENTED FAMILIES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE CASE. ??BUT WE??RE HOPING THAT THAT EMOTIONAL REACTION CAN LEAD TO PEOPLE DOING SOMETHING THAT??S ACTUALLY CONSTRUCTIVE AND NOT DESTRUCTIVE. WE DON??T WANT THE SERIES TO HARM OTHER PEOPLE WHO WERE SUBJECTS IN IT OR WHO PLAYED A ROLE IN IT SOMEHOW.? DEMOS AND RICCIARDI ARE STILL IN CONTACT WITH AND RECORDING AVERY WHO IS IN PRISON FOR LIFE WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE. THEY STRESS THAT AVERY??S STORY IS JUST ONE OF MYRIAD TALES OF MEN AND WOMEN LOST WITHIN AND CONDEMNED BY AN IMPERFECT AMERICAN JUDICIAL SYSTEM. ??THESE ARE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN EVERY COUNTY IN THIS COUNTRY? DEMOS SAID. ??WE HOPE THAT THE DIALOGUE GETS BEYOND THIS CASE AND BEYOND MANITOWOC COUNTY. I THINK THAT WOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY SQUANDERED IF THE DIALOGUE DID NOT BROADEN TO LOOK AT WHAT THE BROADER THINGS GOING ON HERE ARE.? ??WE CONSIDER THIS AN AMERICAN STORY? ADDED RICCIARDI. ??AN AMERICAN STORY THAT HAPPENED TO PLAY OUT IN WISCONSIN.? ,150032.0

ALL BECAUSE YOU HAVE A STUPID INEPT CASEWORKER AT YOUR FACILITY THAT ENCOURAGES 11-YEAR-OLDS TO ENGAGE IN BRUTAL VIOLENCE AND STANDS AROUND WATCHING AND CHEERING.? VIDEO OF THE INCIDENT INITIALLY SPREAD ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND WAS THEN REPORTED TO THE AUTHORITIES. AS THE HERALD NOTED THE CHSFL EMPLOYEE HAS BEEN TERMINATED THE FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES (DCF) IS INVESTIGATING THE INCIDENT FOR CHILD ABUSE AND THE TWO BOYS??REFERRED TO IN COURT AS J.W. AND N.L.??HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM THE CHSFL-OPERATED FOSTER HOME THE LOCATION OF WHICH HAS YET TO BE MADE PUBLIC. BUT BOTH REGIONAL COUNSEL EUGENE ZENOBI AND??JUDGING FROM HIS COMMENTS DURING THE COURT HEARING??HANZMAN ARE INTERESTED IN TAKING FURTHER ACTION AGAINST CHSFL A PRIVATE AGENCY WHICH RUNS 11 FOSTER HOMES IN SOUTH FLORIDA. ??ARE YOU GOING TO SHUT DOWN THIS GROUP HOME OR DO YOU WANT ME TO DO IT FOR YOU?? THE JUDGE ASKED DURING THE HEARING PER THE HERALD??S REPORT. ZENOBI IS ALLEGING IN A COURT MOTION THAT THE INCIDENT WITH THE TWO BOYS MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ??ISOLATED? AND ??THAT ALL OF THE CHILDREN IN THE CARE OF CHS ARE POTENTIALLY IN DANGER OF SIMILAR ABUSE.? THE DAILY BEAST REACHED OUT TO ZENOBI BY PHONE ON TUESDAY BUT HE WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE FOR COMMENT. AS THE HERALD NOTES FOSTER CARE IN MIAMI-DADE FLORIDA??S MOST POPULOUS COUNTY INVOLVES THREE ENTITIES AND TWO SEPARATE SUBCONTRACTS. DCF A FLORIDA STATE AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR CHILD WELFARE HAS A CONTRACT WITH THE NONPROFIT AGENCY OUR KIDS OF MIAMI-DADE/MONROE WHICH IN TURN CONTRACTS WITH CHSFL TO RUN THE 11 GROUP HOMES INCLUDING THE AS-YET-UNIDENTIFIED HOME WHERE THE ??COCKFIGHTING? VIDEO WAS FILMED. MICHELLE GLADY PRESS SECRETARY FOR THE DCF TOLD THE DAILY BEAST ??FOLLOWING A REPORT TO THE ABUSE HOTLINE DCF OPENED AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE SUPERVISION OF THE CHILDREN IN THE HOME.

IN THIS CASE AS IN ALL CASES THE ONLY ACCEPTABLE OUTCOME IS PROVIDING FOR THE SAFETY AND WELL-BEING OF CHILDREN.? A CHSFL SPOKESPERSON TOLD THE DAILY BEAST: ??CHILDREN??S HOME SOCIETY OF FLORIDA HAS A DEEP COMMITMENT AND STRONG REPUTATION FOR PROTECTING THE CHILDREN IN OUR CARE. THIS INCIDENT IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE AND IN NO WAY REPRESENTS THE WORK OUR STAFF DOES EACH AND EVERY DAY. NOR DOES IT MEET OUR ORGANIZATION??S EXPECTATIONS AND STANDARDS OF CARE.\ ??THE EMPLOYEE WAS TERMINATED AND DID ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SHE DID NOT FOLLOW OUR DE-ESCALATION PROTOCOLS? DR. MAGGIE DANTE SOUTHEAST EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CHSFL?ŸDR. MAGGIE DANTE SOUTHEAST EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CHSFL EXPLAINED IN FURTHER DETAIL IN A STATEMENT TO THE HERALD. IF JUDGE HANZMAN??S ACCOUNT OF THE INCIDENT IS CORRECT THE EMPLOYEE DID MORE THAN FAIL TO DE-ESCALATE SHE ACTIVELY ESCALATED. ??OH SHE WAS VERY COMPOSED? THE JUDGE REPORTEDLY SAID IN RESPONSE TO DANTE??S CLAIM THAT THE EMPLOYEE ??LOST HER COMPOSURE? AFTER ONE BOY THREW SOMETHING AT THE OTHER. ??SHE ENCOURAGED THE KIDS TO FIGHT. SHE SAID [TO] GO AHEAD AND FIGHT JUST DON??T USE WEAPONS. LET??S HAVE A FIGHT. SHE CIRCLED EVERYBODY AROUND. GOT THE KIDS ALL RILED UP.? FLORIDA??S CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM HAS LONG BEEN THE SUBJECT OF PUBLIC SCRUTINY. CHILD FATALITIES REPORTED TO THE DCF HAVE INCREASED EVERY YEAR SINCE 2012 WHEN THE COUNT WAS 411 DEATHS ACCORDING TO THEIR INTERNAL STATISTICS. IN 2015 472 FATALITIES WERE REPORTED TO THE DCF HOTLINE INCLUDING 202 CASES IN WHICH THE AGENCY HAD HAD CONTACT WITH THE FAMILY WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. IN 2014 JACK MOSS A FORMER REGIONAL DIRECTOR FOR THE DCF WROTE FOR WLRN THAT THE DEPARTMENT SUFFERS FROM ??SYSTEM OVERLOAD HIGH TURNOVER AND INADEQUATE TRAINING AND FUNDING.? THAT SAME YEAR GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT SIGNED LEGISLATION DESIGNED TO REFORM THE DCF IN RESPONSE TO THE MIAMI HERALD INVESTIGATION ??INNOCENTS LOST? WHICH DREW ATTENTION TO THE NUMBER OF CHILD FATALITIES. THE 2014 LEGISLATION DID NOT CHANGE THE FACT THAT FLORIDA??S CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM IS COMPLETELY PRIVATIZED. PRIVATIZATION WAS COMPLETED DURING THE ADMINISTRATION OF GOVERNOR JEB BUSH AND AS THE DAILY BEAST??S BETSY WOODRUFF REPORTED LAST JUNE IT REMAINS CONTROVERSIAL TODAY. FOR HANZMAN WHO FIRST LEARNED ABOUT THE CASE WHEN THE HOSPITALIZED BOY COULD NOT COME TO COURT TO COLLECT HIS CHRISTMAS GIFTS THE BLAME FOR THIS LATEST HIGH-PROFILE INCIDENT LIES SQUARELY WITH CHSFL. ??WHAT IS REALLY SAD IS THESE KIDS ARE ABUSED ABANDONED AND NEGLECTED? HE SAID. ??AND THEN THEY GET TAKEN FROM THEIR PARENTS. THEY COME IN EXPECTING REFUGE.

THERE??S SOMETHING SO OTHERWORLDLY SO MONSTROUS SO MYSTERIOUS ABOUT THEM. THERE THEY SIT OR STAND DOMINATING OUR NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUMS. THEIR GARGANTUAN SIZE AND SHARP FEATURES PROVIDE UNNERVING TESTIMONY TO THE DIFFERENT EARTHLY REALITIES MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO. THEIR FOSSILIZED REMNANTS OFFER COMPELLING EVIDENCE THAT THEY ARE REAL. THEIR SKELETONS DELIVER REASSURING PROOF THEY ARE DEAD. ALL THESE BEASTS HAD TO BE DISCOVERED RECOVERED RECONSTRUCTED. ADDITIONALLY OUR OBSESSION HAD TO BE NURTURED. IN MANY WAYS ONE INDIVIDUAL THE APTLY-NAMED BARNUM BROWN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR FINDING SOME OF THE GREATEST DINOSAUR DISCOVERIES AND FUELING OUR FASCINATION WITH THEM. BROWN WHO INDEED WAS NAMED AFTER THE GREAT SHOWMAN WAS BORN IN FRONTIER KANSAS IN 1873. THE PARENTAL IMPASSE OVER WHAT TO NAME THE YOUNG LAD ENDED AFTER A FEW DAYS WHEN P.T. BARNUM??S DAZZLING CIRCUS VISITED. ??THERE MUST BE SOMETHING IN A NAME? BROWN WHO HAD HIS OWN GENIUS FOR SELF-PROMOTION?ŸWOULD SAY ??FOR I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IN THE BUSINESS OF RUNNING A FOSSIL MENAGERIE.? HIS UPBRINGING ON AMERICA??S HARDSCRABBLE PLAINS COMBINED WITH HIS FUTURE CAREER SHUTTLING BETWEEN EXOTIC GODFORSAKEN FOSSIL-LADEN LOCATIONS AND NEW YORK??S MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY MADE BARNUM BROWN A REMARKABLE TRANSITION FIGURE. LIVING NINE DECADES UNTIL 1963 HE SYNTHESIZED THE NINETEENTH CENTURY??S COWBOY CODE WITH THE TWENTIETH CENTURY??S SCIENTIFIC AND MEDIA MORES. ONE PART INDIAN JONES-LIKE INTREPID EXPLORER ONE PART STEPHEN HAWKINGS-LIKE ACADEMIC SUPERSNOVA BROWN WOULD BECOME ??THE MOST SUCCESSFUL FIELD PALEONTOLOGIST IN HISTORY? ACCORDING TO HIS?ŸBIOGRAPHERS LOWELL DINGUS AND MARK NORELL.

WHEN HE DIED THE NEW YORK TIMES?ŸOBITUARY CHRISTENED HIM ??FATHER OF THE DINOSAURS.? AS A KANSAS PIONEER DURING THE PRE-CIVIL WAR 1850S BROWN??S FATHER SAW FARMERS CAUGHT BETWEEN THE WARRING FORCES OVER WHETHER KANSAS SHOULD BE A FREE STATE OR A SLAVE STATE. PREFERRING TO BE A MOVING TARGET HE TRANSPORTED GOODS AROUND THE AREA IN COVERED WAGONS. LATER THE FATHER??S CRUDE STRIP-MINING OPERATION UNCOVERED AN UNDERGROUND UNIVERSE OF LOST TREASURES. THE YOUNGER BARNUM?ŸWOULD RECALL THAT THE FAMILY BUSINESS ??UNEARTHED VAST NUMBERS AND VARIETIES OF SEASHELLS CRINOID STEMS AND PARTS CORALS.? HE ??FOLLOWED THE PLOWS AND SCRAPERS AND OBTAINED SUCH A LARGE COLLECTION THAT IT FILLED ALL OF THE BUREAU DRAWERS AND BOXES UNTIL ONE COULD SCARCELY MOVE.

HIS FIRST WIFE DIED OF SCARLET FEVER SHORTLY AFTER CHILDBIRTH. THE DISTRAUGHT BROWN LEFT THEIR DAUGHTER TO BE RAISED BY HER GRANDPARENTS. BROWN REMARRIED BUT EVEN IN THOSE MORE DISCRETE TIMES WAS KNOWN AS A CAD. HIS SECOND WIFE LILIAN BROWN GOT THE LAST LAUGH WITH A PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE NEGLECTED-WIFE-OF-A-WORKAHOLIC MEMOIR:?ŸI MARRIED A DINOSAUR. OF COURSE LILIAN PROBABLY WISHED HER WANDERING HUSBAND WAS A BIT MORE OLD-FASHIONED. FROM THE TIME HE STARTED HUNTING FOSSILS WHILE STUDYING AT THE UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS IN 1894 BROWN DEMONSTRATED A KNACK FOR THE WORK AND FOR COMMANDEERING ATTENTION. HIS PROFESSOR THE PALEONTOLOGIST SAMUEL WENDELL WILLISTON?ŸWOULD CALL BROWN ??THE BEST MAN IN THE FIELD THAT I EVER HAD. HE IS VERY ENERGETIC HAS GREAT POWERS OF ENDURANCE WALKING THIRTY MILES A DAY WITHOUT FATIGUE IS VERY METHODICAL IN ALL HIS HABITS AND THOROUGHLY HONEST.? IN 1895 THE TWO FOUND A TRICERATOPS SKULL IN WYOMING. WILLISTON HELPED PLACE HIS PROT??G?? AT THE MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY IN NEW YORK WHICH AT THE TIME DID NOT DISPLAY ONE DINOSAUR. BROWN ONLY EARNED HIS B.A. A DECADE LATER. THUS BEGAN A 66-YEAR-CAREER THAT YIELDED TONS OF FOSSILS INCLUDING MORE THAN 32 SPECIMENS DISPLAYED AT THE MUSEUM TODAY??AND BOXES NOT YET PROCESSED THERE HALF A CENTURY AFTER HIS DEATH. LIVING LIFE LIKE A MOVIE SCRIPT BROWN SURVIVED SHIPWRECKS IN PATAGONIA SPY ADVENTURES IN TURKEY MALARIA IN BURMA AND THE WRATH OF JILTED LOVERS WORLDWIDE. HE CONSULTED FOR OIL COMPANIES ADVISING WHERE TO DRILL AS HE SOUGHT SITES TO EXCAVATE. HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SINCLAIR OIL COMPANY PROVED PARTICULARLY LUCRATIVE FOR HIM AND FOR THE COMPANY WHOSE LOGO STILL HAS A GREEN DIPLODOCUS DINOSAUR. HE CONVEYED CRITICAL GEOLOGICAL INFORMATION TO THE GOVERNMENT EVEN HELPING TO PLAN INVASIONS DURING WORLD WAR II IN AREAS HE HAD EXPLORED. AND HE BECAME A POP STAR MOBBED BY FANS WHEREVER HE TOURED CONSULTING WITH WALT DISNEY DURING THE FILMING OF FANTASIA??S DINOSAUR SEQUENCE AND HOSTING HIS OWN CBS RADIO SHOW. THROUGH IT ALL ??MR.

IT??S SOMETHING HE LIKES TO DO CREATIVE-WISE. IT??S SOMETHING HE GETS EXCITED ABOUT. HE WATCHES A LOT OF ONLINE TUTORIALS.? IN FACT WILWERT LAUGHED THAT ETHAN IS ALREADY HELPING HER DO HER OWN. ??HE DOES A MUCH BETTER JOB THAN I DO ON MYSELF. MANY TIMES I HAVE TO BORROW HIS STASH OF MAKEUP. HE HELPS ME OUT.? ONE OF ETHAN??S FAVORITE MAKEUP TUTORIALS IS TAUGHT BY JEFFREE STAR A DESIGNER/MODEL/SINGER/MAKEUP ARTIST WHO HAS A THEATRICAL DRAG QUEEN STYLE??AND THAT??S WHAT ETHAN WANTED TO EXPLORE WHEN HE MET WITH JOEY KILLMEYER AT MAC FOR HIS ONE-ON-ONE TUTORIAL. WILWERT DESCRIBED AN ??IMMEDIATE CONNECTION? BETWEEN ETHAN AND KILLMEYER WHO WAS COMPLETELY ENAMORED OF ETHAN??S SKILLS. ??IT WAS SUCH AN AWESOME EXPERIENCE? KILLMEYER TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. ??HE WAS SO AMAZING AND TALENTED THAT HE WAS ABLE TO DO HALF OF HIS FACE ON HIS OWN. GRANTED I DID HIS EYEBROWS AND HIS EYELASHES BUT HE DID EVERYTHING ELSE.? KILLMEYER WHO HAS BEEN A MAKEUP ARTIST FOR 15 YEARS WAS SO IMPRESSED BY ETHAN AND SO TOUCHED BY WILWERT??S SUPPORT FOR HER SON??S INTEREST IN MAKEUP ART THAT WITH HER PERMISSION HE POSTED A PICTURE OF HIM AND ETHAN IN DRAG MAKEUP ON FACEBOOK. IT??S CLEAR FROM THE PHOTO HOW TALENTED AND HAPPY ETHAN IS: DRAMATIC EYEBROWS SMOKY SHADES OF BLUE AROUND HIS EYES AND RICHLY PLUM LIPS IN A POUT THAT REVEALS JUST A HINT OF SMILE. THERE IS JOY IN HIS FABULOUS FIERCE EXPRESSION. ADMITTEDLY THIS PHOTO IS NOT THE ??TYPICAL? IMAGE OF A YOUNG HAPPY BOY??AND IT FAST GAINED ATTENTION BEING SHARED BY THOUSANDS AND EARNING MORE THAN 140000 LIKES AS OF JANUARY 3 (THE ORIGINAL POST IS NO LONGER ACCESSIBLE). ??8-YEAR-OLD FULFILLS DREAM OF BECOMING A DRAG QUEEN? HERALDED TOWLEROAD IN SUPPORT. ??THIS KID WILL GROW UP TO BE WELL-ADJUSTED SELF-ACTUALIZED AND WILL LITERALLY GIVE NOT ONE F**K TO THE REMAINING INSECURE MISOGYNISTS IN OUR CULTURE WHO WILL LIKELY TOSS OUT INSULTS AT THIS KID FROM A PLACE OF COWARDLY ANONYMITY? WROTE ONE ONLINE COMMENTATOR IN RESPONSE TO THE STORY. ??OBVIOUSLY AS YOU ARE SUCH A TRANS-ALLY YOU HAVE NO PROBLEMS WITH THE SEXUALISATION OF CHILDREN? POSTED ANOTHER. ??THIS KID IS 8.

WHEN SPEAKING WITH KILLMEYER HE EMPHASIZED THAT ETHAN??S DESIRE TO LEARN HOW TO DO DRAG MAKEUP DID NOT MAKE HIM A DRAG QUEEN. ??IT??S NOT LIKE HE??S RUNNING AROUND LIKE THAT. JUST BECAUSE HE LIKED WATCHING JEFFREE STAR DOESN??T MEAN HE??S A DRAG QUEEN. THAT??S THE PROBLEM. I DON??T WANT HIM LABELED. HE??S YOUNG.

HOWEVER WILWERT SAID ??I THINK PEOPLE MISUNDERSTAND IT WAS A ONE-TIME FUN DEAL. HE DOESN??T EVEN WEAR MAKEUP IN DAILY LIFE.? FOR HIS PARENTS ETHAN??S INTEREST IN MAKEUP GOES ALONG WITH HIS PASSION FOR DRAWING AND OTHER FORMS OF ARTISTIC EXPRESSION. ETHAN??S FATHER IS A GRAPHIC DESIGNER AND WHILE HE AND WILWERT ARE NO LONGER TOGETHER SHE STRESSED THEY CO-PARENT AND THAT HE AND THE ??EXTENDED FAMILY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF ETHAN WHATEVER HE WANTS TO DO WHATEVER HE WANTS TO BE PASSIONATE ABOUT.? WILWERT SAID THAT ??THE OTHER BACKLASH IS THAT IT??S MAKING HIM GAY? WAS COMPLETELY MISGUIDED. ??THIS IS REALLY NOT ABOUT GENDER IDENTITY OR SEXUAL PREFERENCE. IT??S ABOUT A YOUNG BOY HAPPENING TO HAVE AN INTEREST IN THE ARTS. IT WOULD BE NO DIFFERENT THAN A GIRL LIKING SPORTS OR A TRUCK. I THINK WE??RE TOO QUICK TO JUDGE. ??PEOPLE THINK GENDER IS BLACK-AND-WHITE THAT IF YOU??RE A BOY AND LIKE MAKEUP YOU??RE GAY. THAT??S NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO BE THE CASE.

WHEN HE HAD HIS MAKEUP ON HE OWNED IT. I THINK BECAUSE HE??S SO CONFIDENT IT MAKES OTHERS SECURE.? SOME OF THE ATTACKS HAVE BEEN DIRECTED AGAINST WILWERT AS A MOTHER BUT SHE WON??T LET THE HATERS CHANGE HER AND HER FAMILY. ??I WANT TO SAY I??M ALWAYS GOING TO SUPPORT MY SON AND WHAT HE WANTS TO DO. I KNOW WHAT I??M DOING IS RIGHT. WE??RE TRYING TO SPREAD A MESSAGE OF UNCONDITIONAL LOVE OF YOUR CHILDREN. EMBRACE DIFFERENCES AND THE UNIQUE QUALITIES IN YOUR CHILDREN INSTEAD OF PUSHING THEM INTO WHAT WE THINK OR WHAT SOCIETY THINKS THEY SHOULD BE.? CHILD PSYCHOLOGY EXPERTS ENDORSE WILWERT??S ENCOURAGING OPEN-MINDED PARENTING. ??THIS MOM SEEMS REALLY AWESOME AND HAS ALLOWED HER SON TO TRY OUT DIFFERENT THINGS? DR.

IT??S IMPORTANT THEY GET TO TRY ON DIFFERENT IDEAS AND WAYS OF EXPRESSING THEMSELVES. IT??S REALLY NORMAL FOR KIDS TO EXPERIMENT WITH HOW THEY EXPRESS THEMSELVES.? NOR DID DR. ROUSE SEE ANYTHING OVERTLY SEXUAL OR DISCONCERTING IN ETHAN??S EXAMPLE OF THEATRICAL MAKEUP. ??I DON??T SEE THIS AS A SEXUAL EXPRESSION. I SEE IT AS A FUN CREATIVE WAY OF TRYING SOMETHING NEW OUT? HE SAID. RATHER THAN WORRYING ABOUT WHETHER WEARING MAKEUP WAS ??SEXUALIZING? A CHILD OR CREATING GENDER CONFUSION ROUSE SAID THE CONCERN FOR PARENTS SHOULD BE THAT ??AS ADULTS WE DON??T OVER-INTERPRET THESE FORMS OF EXPERIMENTATION.? ??IF YOU SAY TO A CHILD ??THIS ISN??T AN ACCEPTABLE WAY OF EXPRESSING YOURSELF?? IT??S LIKE SAYING ??THIS ISN??T AN ACCEPTABLE VERSION OF YOU.?? YOU RUN THE RISK OF PUTTING DOWN HOW THEY SEE THEMSELVES. ??IT DOESN??T MEAN HE??S GOING TO GROW UP TO BE GAY OR TRANSGENDER. BUT IF HE IS GAY OR TRANSGENDER AS LONG AS THE PARENTS SAY ??WE LOVE YOU AND SUPPORT YOU?? THOSE ARE ALL ACCEPTABLE OUTCOMES.? WILWERT SAID SHE HAS RECEIVED MESSAGES ON FACEBOOK FROM PEOPLE SHE??S NEVER EVEN MET THANKING HER FOR ENCOURAGING ETHAN??S CREATIVITY AND REFUSING TO FORCE HIM INTO STEREOTYPICAL ROLES. ??THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER PARENTS WHO FEEL THEY DIDN??T HAVE A VOICE UNTIL NOW? SHE SAID. ??WE LOVE AND ACCEPT HIM.

IT??S CERTAINLY LONG AND FAIRLY AMBITIOUS BUT WHEREAS THE ??05 EDITION QUESTIONED WHITE PEOPLES?? PLACE AS CONSUMERS AND CREATORS OF HIP-HOP THIS SONG ATTEMPTS TO RECONCILE THE CURRENT POLITICAL CLIMATE WITH MACKLEMORE??S OWN STATUS AS A POP STAR. UNFORTUNATELY A SONG SUCH AS THIS DOES MORE TO GIVE VOICE TO THE WHITE GUY RAPPING THAN THE ACTUAL DOUBLE STANDARDS THAT MAKE MANY OF HIS WHITE FANS TURN A DEAF EAR TO BLACK LIVES MATTER. SURE THERE??S SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR MACKLEMORE??S AWKWARD EARNESTNESS. DOES HE TRY TOO HARD? ALWAYS. PART OF WHAT MAKES IT EASY TO DISMISS MACKLEMORE IS THE WAY HE PRESENTS HIS STABS AT TOPICALITY??THE LACK OF SUBTLETY AND NUANCE MAKES IT SEEM LIKE AN AFTER SCHOOL SPECIAL. AND HIS HAMFISTEDNESS OFTEN COMES ACROSS AS DISINGENUOUS AND OPPORTUNISTIC??LIKE WHEN HE SENT A TEXT APOLOGIZING TO KENDRICK LAMAR FOR WINNING THE RAP ALBUM OF THE YEAR GRAMMY IN 2014 AND THEN SHARED THE EXCHANGE VIA INSTAGRAM. WHETHER IT??S BRINGING OUT HIP-HOP LEGENDS AT THE VMAS OR WRITING A SONG ABOUT RACISM HE OFTEN SEEMS LIKE A PANDERER WHICH NEUTERS A LOT OF WHAT HE ATTEMPTS TO CONVEY HERE. NOW I DON??T KNOW THE INNER WORKINGS OF MACKLEMORE??S BRAIN AND I WON??T MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT HIS INTENTIONS. BUT ??WHITE PRIVILEGE II? SEEMS MORE PREDICATED ON HIM VOICING HIS FRUSTRATION WITH BEING A MISUNDERSTOOD WHITE GUY IN A BLACK MEDIUM THAN IT IS ANY REAL POLITICAL STATEMENT. THAT??S NOT INHERENTLY BAD BUT IT MUDDIES THINGS WHEN THE SONG IS PRESENTED AS SOMETHING GRANDER. HIS DESIRE TO VENT SHOULD BE MARRIED TO SOME IDEA OF HOW TO BEST ELEVATE THE ISSUE ITSELF. TO HIS CREDIT MACKLEMORE DOES SEEM TO WANT TO BE A ??PART OF THE SOLUTION.? HE JUST DOESN??T SEEM TO HAVE A CLUE WHAT THAT MEANS. ??YOU??VE EXPLOITED AND STOLEN THE MUSIC THE MOMENT THE MAGIC THE PASSION THE FASHION YOU TOY WITH.

AND THESE DAYS IN BETTER BARS EVERYWHERE MORE OFTEN THAN NOT THAT FINAL FLOURISH ISN??T AN ELECTRIC-RED ICE CREAM SUNDAE TOPPER BUT A SWEET-BUT-NOT-TOO-SWEET CANDIED FRUIT FROM LUXARDO. IN FACT THE ITALIAN COMPANY??S MARASCHINO CHERRIES ARE SO POPULAR WITH SERIOUS COCKTAIL DRINKERS THAT THEIR NAME HAS PRACTICALLY BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH THE INGREDIENT. LUXARDO STARTED MAKING THE CHERRIES BACK IN THE 1880S IN WHAT IS TODAY ZARA CROATIA. THAT WAS DURING THE HEIGHT OF THEIR POPULARITY SAYS GREG BOEHM WHO OWNS A VAST LIBRARY OF DRINKS BOOKS AND IS FOUNDER OF COCKTAIL KINGDOM WHICH PRODUCES FINE REPRODUCTIONS OF MANY HISTORICAL MIXOLOGY TOMES. CHERRIES WERE COMMON FROM THE 1860S TO 1899 WHEN OLIVES REPLACED THEM. BOEHM CITED AN ARTICLE FROM JUNE 22 1899 THAT RAN IN THE RACINE DAILY JOURNAL TO SUPPORT HIS OPINION: ??IN SOME OF THE SWELL UPTOWN ESTABLISHMENTS THE COCKTAIL OLIVE IS GETTING IN ITS WORK AND BIDS FAIR TO SUPPLANT THE TOOTHSOME CHERRY WITH THE PUBLIC.? SO IT??S NO WONDER THAT GOOD CHERRIES WERE HARD TO FIND FOR DECADES. MODERN AMERICAN TIPPLERS DIDN??T REDISCOVER LUXARDO??S GARNISH UNTIL 2004 WHEN FAMED BARTENDER AUDREY SAUNDERS RECEIVED FOUR JARS OF THEM TO USE IN HER LEGENDARY NEW YORK WATERING HOLE PEGU CLUB. BARTENDERS NEVER LOOKED BACK. IF YOU PLANNED TO SERVE A CHERRY GARNISH ANYWHERE IN THE FIVE BOROUGHS FROM THEN ON IT HAD BETTER HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD ONE. MARASCHINO LIQUEUR LUXARDO??S OTHER SIGNATURE PRODUCT HAS BEEN AROUND EVEN LONGER DEBUTING IN 1821??THE YEAR WHEN GIROLAMO LUXARDO AND HIS WIFE MARIA STARTED THE COMPANY. (THE COUPLE HAD MOVED TO ZARA A FEW YEARS EARLIER FROM GENOA.) ZARA WAS KNOWN FOR SOUR MARASCA CHERRY??BASED ROSOLIO MARASCHINO LIQUEUR BUT THE LUXARDO FAMILY CAME UP WITH ITS OWN RECIPE AND PACKED THE CONCOCTION IN A DISTINCTIVE STRAW-COVERED BOTTLE. (THOUGH THEIR FORMULA IS A SECRET THEY HAVE ADMITTED THAT IT IS VOID OF ROSE PETALS A TRADITIONAL INGREDIENT IN THE AREA??S ORIGINAL LIQUEUR.) WHILE THE BRACING SPIRIT IS A NECESSARY COMPONENT OF CLASSIC COCKTAILS LIKE THE LAST WORD THE AVIATION AND THE MARTINEZ IT WAS NEARLY FORGOTTEN BY MODERN BARTENDERS AND DRINKERS. TODAY HOWEVER THE BEST CRAFT COCKTAIL BARS AROUND THE COUNTRY USE THE LIQUEUR REGULARLY. BUT IRONICALLY ENOUGH IT ISN??T AT ALL POPULAR WITH DRINKERS IN ITS HOME MARKET OF ITALY WHERE IT IS USED MOSTLY BY BAKERS AND AS A TOPPING FOR FRUIT SALADS. THAT WASN??T ALWAYS THE CASE. AROUND THE TURN OF THE CENTURY IT WAS IN MUCH GREATER DEMAND. SO MUCH SO THAT IN 1913 THE LUXARDO FAMILY BUILT A LARGE DISTILLERY WHICH ALSO SERVED AS THEIR HOME RIGHT ON ZARA??S HARBOR. CHARLES H. BAKER WROTE IN HIS LEGENDARY SPIRITED TRAVELOGUE THE GENTLEMAN??S COMPANION WHICH WAS FIRST PUBLISHED IN 1939 THAT ??MARASCHINO IS SO ESSENTIAL THAT NO FAIRLY EQUIPPED BAR CAN AFFORD TO BE WITHOUT IT.? THAT ALL CHANGED WITH THE OUTBREAK OF WORLD WAR II. IN 1943 ALLIED FORCES BOMBED ZARA WHICH AT THAT POINT WAS PART OF ITALY. AN INFERNO WAITING TO HAPPEN THANKS TO ALL ITS STORED ALCOHOL THE FAMILY??S FACILITY BURNED FOR FOUR DAYS. TITO??S COMMUNIST PARTISANS SOON TOOK IT OVER KILLING SEVERAL FAMILY MEMBERS WHOSE BODIES WERE NEVER RECOVERED. GIORGIO LUXARDO GIROLAMO??S GREAT GRANDSON AND THE COMPANY??S MASTER DISTILLER FLED TO ITALY. GIORGIO WAS DETERMINED TO RESTART THE COMPANY FROM SCRATCH. WHILE THE FAMILY LOST JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING THEY WERE ABLE TO RESCUE A RECIPE BOOK AND ACCORDING TO LEGEND A SINGLE CHERRY SAPLING. ULTIMATELY THEY SETTLED IN THE VENETO REGION WHICH HAS ACIDIC VOLCANIC SOIL. ??IT??S PERFECT SOIL FOR THE CULTIVATION OF THE 30000 CHERRY TREES WE HAVE IN THE AREA? SAYS MATTEO LUXARDO THE COMPANY??S CURRENT EXPORT MANAGER AND GIORGIO??S GRANDSON. LOCATION MEANT EVERYTHING. SITUATING HIS FACILITY OUTSIDE OF A CITY THIS TIME GIORGIO REASONED THAT IF A WAR SHOULD BREAK OUT AGAIN IT WOULD BE UNLIKELY THAT THEIR DISTILLERY WOULD BE BOMBED. OVER THE FOLLOWING DECADES THE DEMAND FOR MARASCHINO LIQUEUR WANED. BUT AS ITALIAN RESTAURANTS BEGAN TO FLOURISH AROUND THE WORLD THE FAMILY EKED OUT A LIVING BY SELLING ITS OTHER CLASSIC ITALIAN LIQUEURS INCLUDING SAMBUCA GRAPPA AND LIMONCELLO. NOT READY TO ABANDON THEIR SIGNATURE THEY CONTINUED TO PRODUCE THEIR MARASCHINO LIQUEUR AND CHERRIES??HOPING ALL THE WHILE THAT BARTENDERS WOULD TURN BACK TO IT ONE DAY. FORTUNATELY THAT DAY HAS COME. ??THE LUXARDO BRAND IS THE GOLD STANDARD HERE AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN? WROTE DAVID WONDRICH IN HIS 2007 AWARD-WINNING BOOK IMBIBE! WHICH HAS BECOME NECESSARY READING FOR THE CURRENT GENERATION OF BARTENDERS. LUXARDO HAS BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL THAT ITS INSPIRED A NUMBER OF BARS TO MAKE THEIR OWN CHERRIES IN-HOUSE AND OTHER FIRMS LIKE THE ITALIAN FABBRI AND EVEN KENTUCKY??S WOODFORD RESERVE HAVE INTRODUCED VERSIONS. NO DOUBT GIROLAMO AND MARIA ARE THRILLED THAT CHERRY GARNISHES AND LIQUEUR ARE BACK IN VOGUE??AND WONDERING WHAT TOOK SO LONG. ,10369.0
362,9770372.0,2016-01-09T05:01:00+00:00,CHRISTMAS EVE IS THE MOST DEPRESSING DAY OF THE YEAR,FOR SOME IT??S DEFINITELY NOT THE MOST WONDERFUL TIME OF THE YEAR. THE HOLIDAYS CAN BE PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING FOR PEOPLE WHO SUFFER FROM DEPRESSION. AND DURING THIS MOST RECENT HOLIDAY SEASON CHRISTMAS EVE MAY HAVE BEEN THE MOST DEPRESSING DAY OF ALL. THAT??S ACCORDING TO IODINE A HEALTH CARE INFORMATION WEBSITE WHICH OFFERS AN IOS APPLICATION CALLED START THAT HELPS USERS TRACK THE EFFECTS OF THEIR ANTIDEPRESSANTS. FROM DECEMBER 18TH OF LAST YEAR TO JANUARY 3RD OVER 3000 PEOPLE TOOK A PHQ-9 SURVEY??AN INSTRUMENT THAT MEASURES THE SEVERITY OF DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS ON A SCALE FROM 0 TO 27??EITHER THROUGH IODINE??S ONLINE DEPRESSION TEST OR THROUGH START. THE INFORMATION THEY RECORDED IS BY NO MEANS NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE BUT IT??S STILL AN INDICATION THAT FOR PEOPLE WITH DEPRESSION CHRISTMAS EVE CAN BE MORE OF A HURDLE THAN IT IS A HOLIDAY. IODINE FOUND THAT AVERAGE PHQ-9 SCORES FLUCTUATED SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE HOLIDAYS WITH A SPIKE OF 15.2 ON CHRISTMAS EVE AND A DIP OF 13.6 ON NEW YEAR??S DAY. IODINE HAS ONLY BEEN RUNNING THE DEPRESSION TEST SINCE EARLY LAST DECEMBER BUT SO FAR CHRISTMAS EVE IS THE MOST DEPRESSED DAY THEY HAVE ON RECORD. THE PHQ-9 SURVEY IS A STANDARD CLINICAL INSTRUMENT ASKING RESPONDENTS TO REFLECT ON THE PAST TWO WEEKS AND RATE ON A SCALE FROM 0 TO 3 HOW FREQUENTLY THEY??VE EXPERIENCED NINE SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION INCLUDING: TAKING ??LITTLE INTEREST OR PLEASURE IN DOING THINGS? EXPERIENCING ??TROUBLE CONCENTRATING ON THINGS? OR HAVING ??THOUGHTS THAT YOU WOULD BE BETTER OFF DEAD OR HURTING YOURSELF IN SOME WAY.? THESE SCORES ARE THEN TALLIED TO PRODUCE A TOTAL PHQ-9 SCORE. BELOW 10 DEPRESSION IS CONSIDERED ??MILD? OR ??MINIMAL.? FROM 10 TO 14 IT IS ??MODERATE.? BETWEEN 15 AND 19??THE RANGE IN WHICH IODINE??S AVERAGE FELL LAST DECEMBER 24TH??DEPRESSION IS ??MODERATELY SEVERE.? OVER 20 IT IS CONSIDERED ??SEVERE.? PHYSICIANS USE THIS SCALE TO DETERMINE THE BEST COURSE OF TREATMENT AND TO DECIDE IF AND WHEN TO PRESCRIBE ANTIDEPRESSANTS. WHY MIGHT CHRISTMASTIME BE ONE OF THE LEAST CHEERY TIMES FOR PEOPLE WITH DEPRESSION? PERHAPS BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH CULTURAL PRESSURE TO EXPERIENCE THE HOLIDAY AS A HOLLY JOLLY FUN FEST SAYS ONE PHYSICIAN. ??A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY??RE SUPPOSED TO BE HAPPY DURING THE HOLIDAYS? PSYCHIATRIST DR. STEVE KOH TOLD CBS NEWS ON THE DAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS EVE 2015. ??EVERYONE AROUND THEM IS TELLING THEM THEY??RE SUPPOSED TO BE HAPPY AND YET INSIDE THEY DON??T [FEEL HAPPY.] SO THERE??S THIS FRICTION BETWEEN WHAT??S HAPPENING INSIDE VERSUS WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS TELLING YOU TO FEEL AND THAT CAN INCREASE DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND ANXIETY.? CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEF AND MANY INACCURATE NEWSPAPER STORIES THE SUICIDE RATE DOES NOT RISE DURING THE HOLIDAY SEASON AND THERE ARE NO RELIABLE POPULATION-LEVEL STATISTICS TO SUGGEST THAT RATES OF DEPRESSION INCREASE IN LATE DECEMBER. AS THE CDC NOTES THE SUICIDE RATE IS ACTUALLY LOWEST IN DECEMBER PEAKING DURING THE SPRING AND THE FALL. BUT IODINE??S USERS AS THE COMPANY TOLD THE DAILY BEAST ??DO NOT REFLECT THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN THAT THEY EITHER HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH DEPRESSION AND ARE BEING TREATED FOR IT OR THEY LIKELY BELIEVE THEY ARE DEPRESSED.? IN OTHER WORDS THE OVERALL RATE OF DEPRESSION MIGHT NOT GO UP DURING THE HOLIDAYS BUT IF YOU ALREADY STRUGGLE WITH THE CONDITION AND OBSERVE THE HOLIDAY THERE??S A STRONG CHANCE CHRISTMAS EVE COULD BE YOUR MOST DIFFICULT DAY. MORE NOT-SO-FUN FACTS FROM THE SERVICE??S DATA SET: IODINE USERS IN UTAH WERE THE MOST DEPRESSED OVER THE HOLIDAYS WITH AN AVERAGE SCORE OF 17 FOLLOWED BY NEBRASKA OREGON AND LOUISIANA. PART OF THIS FINDING AT LEAST SEEMS CONSISTENT WITH SEVERAL STUDIES THAT HAVE FOUND ALARMINGLY HIGH RATES OF DEPRESSION AND SUICIDE IN UTAH OFTEN DESCRIBED AS THE ??MOST DEPRESSED STATE.? USERS IN WEST VIRGINIA WERE THE LEAST DEPRESSED THROUGH THE YEAR-END CELEBRATIONS FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY NEW MEXICO NEVADA AND KENTUCKY. ,5868.0

A COAL MINER??S DAUGHTER BORN IN RURAL SLAB FORK WEST VIRGINIA THE 85-YEAR-OLD MIGHT WELL BE THE MOST PROLIFIC INTERNATIONAL JEWEL THIEF THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN. PAYNE WHO BY ALL ACCOUNTS MAY NEVER HAVE HELD DOWN A JOB ON ??THE BOOKS? HAS MADE A BETTER THAN HEALTHY LIVING HOPSCOTCHING AROUND THE GLOBE IN PURSUIT OF SHINY BAUBLES AND OTHER LUXURY GOODS. ARMED WITH NOTHING MORE THAN AN EASY SMILE DESIGNER CLOTHES AND AN EXQUISITE HANDBAG PAYNE ROUTINELY CHARMED JEWELRY STORY EMPLOYEES OUT OF THEIR WARES. THE FINAL TAKE HAS NEVER BEEN OFFICIALLY TALLIED BUT THE LARGESS GLEANED FROM HER ILLICIT ESCAPADES IS THOUGHT TO EASILY NUMBER IN THE TENS OF MILLIONS. AT ONE TIME SHE WAS THE SUBJECT OF CRIMINAL WARRANTS ON TWO CONTINENTS AND TRACKED BY INTERPOL THE 190 MEMBER MULTI-NATIONAL ORGANIZATION THAT HUNTS FUGITIVES. HERS IS STORY THAT MIGHT BE BETTER SUITED FOR HOLLYWOOD. ONLY PAYNE DOESN??T LOOK LIKE MATT DAMON AND HER TRICKERY IS DECIDEDLY LOWER TECH THAN AN INSTALLMENT OF OCEAN??S ELEVEN. PAYNE PREFERS TO WORK ALONE HER THIEVERY FUELED SOLELY BY HEAVY DOSES OF CHARISMA AND GUILE. SHE HAS BEEN CALLED A ONE-WOMAN GANG TO HER CHAGRIN EXCEPT THE ONLY WEAPON SHE CARRIES IS THE DEMEANOR AND FASHION SENSE OF A HIGH-LIVING SOCIALITE. FOLLOWING HER STORIED EXPLOITS FOR MORE THAN A DECADE I WASN??T PREPARED FOR THE ELOQUENT WELL-APPOINTED WOMAN I ENCOUNTERED. I FELT THE AIR CHANGE AS PAYNE BOUNDED THE NARROW STAIRWELL AND QUIETLY ENTERED THE UPPER CONFERENCE ROOM OF HER ATTORNEY??S SUBURBAN ATLANTA OFFICES.

I NOTED HER VEINY HANDS HER DEEPLY CREASED YET SMOOTH SKIN THE SOFTNESS IN HER STRONG BUT TRUSTING GLANCE. PAYNE TOLD HER STORY SIMPLY AS IF SHE WERE TAKING A MID-AFTERNOON STROLL THROUGH PIEDMONT PARK WHEN THE DOGWOODS BLOOMED IN THE SPRINGTIME. SHE SPOKE LIKE A WOMAN WHO WASN??T WANTED ON AN OUTSTANDING WARRANT IN MECKLENBERG COUNTY NORTH CAROLINA AS IF SHE WASN??T FACING A NEW FELONY SHOPLIFTING CHARGE FOR ALLEGEDLY STEALING A $690 PAIR OF EARRINGS FROM SAKS FIFTH AVENUE. ??I WAS A SHOPPER? SHE TOLD ME AT ONE POINT. ??I KNEW WHAT I WANTED.? WHAT SHE WANTED WAS A 3.5-CARAT RING IN PALM DESERT CALIFORNIA AND ANOTHER WORTH $33000 FROM A STORE IN CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA. PERHAPS SHE IS MOST INFAMOUS FOR A MONTE CARLO CAPER IN THE 1970S THAT YIELDED A 10-CARAT DIAMOND RING VALUED AT OVER A HALF MILLION DOLLARS. THERE HAVE BEEN DOZENS OF SWOOPS SINCE THEN SHE READILY ADMITS. ??I USED TO GO IN STORES SLIP SOMETHING INTO MY POCKETBOOK AND GIVE IT BACK? SHE SAYS OF THE EARLY YEARS. ??IT WAS ALL IN FUN.? POSING AS A WELL-MONEYED CUSTOMER WITH LONG DOLLARS TO SPEND PAYNE LEARNED TO SIMPLY MADE THEM ALL FORGET.

AND FOR THAT PAYNE HAS A 20-PAGE RAP SHEET IN THE U.S. ALONE. SHE IS A CELEBRITY AMONG RETAIL STORE SECURITY TEAMS AND HAS ??NO-TRESPASSING? AGREEMENTS WITH MANY OF THE COUNTRY??S MOST PROMINENT RETAIL CHAINS. ??I WENT TO THREE COUNTRIES IN THREE DAYS? SHE SAYS OF HER FIRST TRIP ABROAD. ??I WENT TO LONDON THEN PARIS AND THEN ROME.? FAR FROM A RUN-OF-THE-MILL SHOPLIFTER ??BOOSTING? STOLEN GOODS FROM THE TRUNK OF A CAR HER LIFE ON THE LAM WAS NEARLY UPENDED IN FRANCE.

SHE WAS HELD FOR NINE MONTHS PAYNE SAID WHILE A FLUMMOXED BAND OF INVESTIGATORS TRIED TO UNRAVEL HER CASE. PAYNE HAD BEEN SEARCHED REPEATEDLY BUT THE OFFICERS CAME UP EMPTY HANDED. THE GEM SHE SAID WAS TUCKED INTO THE HEM OF HER GIRDLE. THE YOUNGEST OF SIX CHILDREN BORN TO DAVID PAYNE AND A MOTHER WHO WAS A SEAMSTRESS PAYNE ATTRIBUTES HER DECEPTIVE SKILLS TO A SOLID PUBLIC SCHOOL EDUCATION. ??I COULD TRAVEL IN EUROPE AS GOOD AS I DID? SHE TOLD ME ??BECAUSE OF THE KNOWLEDGE I HAD OF MAPS.? ??I HAD GEOGRAPHY.

I REALIZE THEN THAT SHE ISN??T PUTTING ON ??AIRS? BUT RATHER AFFORDING ME A LESSON. IT??S A MEASURED COOLNESS I HAD NOT WITNESSED SINCE MY PATERNAL GRANDFATHER PASSED AWAY. I HOLD MY NEXT QUESTION AND WAIT KNOWING THERE IS MORE STORY YET TO UNFOLD. ??LET HER TELL IT? I SAID TO MYSELF. HER FATHER WAS ABUSIVE SHE RECALLED REGULARLY BEATING HER MOTHER UNTIL PAYNE WAS OLD ENOUGH TO STEP IN. AT ONLY 13 SHE FIGURED OUT SHE HAD A SPECIAL GIFT: DISTRACTION. A SHOPKEEPER ALLOWED HER TO TRY ON A GOLD WATCH. WHEN A WHITE CUSTOMER ENTERED THE STORE HE WENT OFF TO TEND TO THE CUSTOMER LEAVING PAYNE ALONE WITH THE MERCHANDISE. SHE SLIPPED OUT BUT RETURNED THE TIMEPIECE LATER. IN TIME SHE GREW MORE BRAZEN AND HER CAREER AS A CROOK TOOK FLIGHT. ??I COULD MAKE THE WHITE PEOPLE TO FORGET? SHE TOLD ME. ??I WOULD SAY THAT I HAVE LIVED AN EXCITING LIFE?? I LEARNED FROM TRYING.? ARMED WITH SOME 20 ALIASES AND MULTIPLE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS PAYNE ADMITS THAT WHILE SHE WAS APPREHENSIVE ABOUT WAKING UP IN FOREIGN LANDS. HOWEVER SHE WAS NEVER NERVOUS ABOUT THE JOB AT HAND. ??I KNEW WHAT I CAME TO DO. THERE WAS NEVER A DAY THAT I WENT TO GET WHAT I WENT TO GET.? DIAMONDS WERE THE EASIEST SHE SAID AND EVEN THOUGH PAYNE WAS SOMETIMES AN OCEAN AWAY FROM HOME SHE WASN??T WORRIED ABOUT THE GETAWAY. ??I READ A LOT ABOUT THE WAR. I KNEW HOW TO GET OUT OF FRANCE OR ANY COUNTRY IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? PAYNE SAID WAVING HER BONEY HANDS AS IF SHE WAS CONDUCTING A SYMPHONY. ??WE HAD TO KNOW EVERY COUNTY EVERY STATE AND EVERY COUNTRY. WE HAD TO KNOW THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM.? IT WAS AN EDUCATION THAT PAYNE CAME TO RELY ON. OVER THE YEARS PAYNE WAS ARRESTED NEARLY TWO DOZEN TIMES??IN FRANCE GREECE SWITZERLAND AND BRITAIN.

HE WAS EMBARRASSED PAYNE COULD TELL BUT HE EXPLAINED THAT THEY WERE DISCUSSING HOW ELEGANT SHE LOOKED. ??WELL I DRESSED LIKE THAT FROM NOW ON!? SHE EXCLAIMED. PAYNE??S LIFE WAS CHRONICLED IN A DOCUMENTARY THE LIFE AND CRIMES OF DORIS PAYNE IN 2014. ACCORDING TO THE FILMMAKERS BEGINNING AROUND 1953 WHEN THE PRESENCE OF A COLORED WOMAN WAS NOT COMMON SHE WALKED OUT OF A PITTSBURGH JEWELRY STORE WITH A DIAMOND VALUED AT $22000. DECADES AND MILLIONS IN ILL-GOTTEN BOOTY LATER IN 2011 PAYNE WAS ARRESTED IN SAN DIEGO ON THEFT CHARGE AND THEN IN COSTA MESA FOR ATTEMPTING TO STEAL A BURBERRY COAT PRICED AT $1300. I ASKED HER ABOUT LOVE. ??YOU HAVE TWO CHILDREN? I SAID. ??YES.? A SON RONALD LIVES IN NEVADA AND A DAUGHTER DONNA IS IN OHIO. THEY ARE GROWN NOW OF COURSE BUT I WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT THEIR FATHER. SHE DOESN??T EXPLAIN WHY SHE HAS NOT RETIRED AND GONE TO LIVE WITH HER CHILDREN. ??TELL ME ABOUT THE LOVE THAT GOT AWAY.? PAYNE DOESN??T ANSWER. SHE GROWS TEARY-EYED AT THE QUESTION AND LEAVES IT UNANSWERED. ??I HAD SOME JOY? SHE SAID IN A MUTED VOICE. HER GLEE IS GONE NOW FOR REASONS PAYNE WILL NOT NAME. IF HE WAS AN ACCOMPLICE OR SOME OTHER ACQUAINTANCE I DO NOT KNOW. A BURLY DEFENSE ATTORNEY HAS BEEN SITTING WITH US FOR THE FULL HOUR OR SO THAT WE??VE BEEN TOGETHER. WHEN THE INTERVIEW IS COMPLETE ATLANTA DEFENSE ATTORNEY SHAWN MCCULLERS WALKS ME THROUGH THE LATEST ROUND OF EVIDENCE AGAINST PAYNE. HE IS DEFENDING HER AGAINST THE SAKS FIFTH AVENUE CHARGES IN ATLANTA AND EVEN I CAN SEE THAT THE CASE APPEARS TO BE FULL OF HOLES. THE WEIGHT OF HER CELEBRITY IS NOT LOST ON MCCULLERS. HE IS A FIGHTER. HE??S THE KIND OF JUNKYARD DOG THAT IS WELL PREPARED TO PUT ANY PROSECUTOR THROUGH THEIR PACES. THE CASE IN IN FULTON COUNTY WON??T BE EASY I FIGURE. THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SEEMS SURE OF THE FACT BUT STORE DETECTIVES CLEARLY DID NOT KNOW WHO THEY STOPPED THAT DAY AND THEIR STATEMENTS DON??T SEEM TO MATCH THE SURVEILLANCE TAPE OR OTHER ALLEGED EVIDENCE THAT MCCULLERS SHOWS ME. THERE IS ANOTHER STORY TO BE TOLD HE TELLS ME BIGGER THAN ANY HEIST PAYNE MIGHT HAVE PULLED??OR ONES THAT THE LAWYER CLAIMS WERE CONCOCTED BY THE JEWELRY STORES THEMSELVES. ?ŸHE HINTS THAT THE INDUSTRY MAY NEED PAYNE MORE THAN SHE NEEDS THEM. ??I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE VALUE REPORTED TO THE INSURANCE COMPANIES DOESN??T ALWAYS MATCH THE INVOICES? MCCULLERS CLAIMS IN A RUEFUL VOICE. I REMEMBER THEN SOMETHING THAT PAYNE TOLD ME EARLIER. ??THAT CHANEL STORE IN MONTE CARLO NEVER SAID HOW MUCH WAS MISSING IN THE MEDIA. YOU CAN ASSUME THAT THEY REPORTED A DIFFERENT VALUE TO THE INSURANCE COMPANY.? MY PHOTOGRAPHER SNAPS A FEW LAST PICTURES BEFORE PAYNE SLIPS AWAY.

10,9544389.0,2016-01-01T05:03:00+00:00,THE SYRIAN REFUGEE BAND TOURING EUROPE,BUKAREVAC SERBIA ?? ON A COOL SEPTEMBER NIGHT IN THE SERBIAN BORDER TOWN OF BUKAREVAC MEMBERS OF THE SYRIAN POST-ROCK BAND KHEBEZ DAWLE STRETCHED OUT ON A PATCH OF GRASS NEXT TO A BUS STATION FULL OF REFUGEES FROM THE WORLDS WORST CONFLICTS. PEOPLE CLAMORING FOR ANY RIDE THAT COULD GET THEM CLOSER TO THE EUROPEAN UNION SWARMED THE BUSSES PULLING IN. IT WAS A LONG WAY FROM THE HARSH STAGE LIGHTS OF BEIRUT??S TRENDY CLUBS WHERE THE BAND WAS A CENTRAL FIXTURE OF A BURGEONING LOCAL INDY ROCK SCENE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS OF HAMRA AND MAR MIKHAEL. IT IS FARTHER STILL FROM THE HORRORS OF THE SYRIAN CIVIL WAR THAT THE BAND FLED IN 2013 AND THE DAMASCUS UNDERGROUND ROCK SCENE THAT BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER. WAITING FOR THE DELAYED MIDNIGHT BUS TO BELGRADE AFTER CROSSING THE MACEDONIAN BORDER THEY MADE A SNAP DECISION TO AVOID THE HUNGARIAN POLICE CRACKDOWN ON ASYLUM SEEKERS ENTERING FROM SERBIA AND TRIED TO REROUTE THROUGH CROATIA. LEAD SINGER ANAS MAGHREBI BASS PLAYER MUHAMMAD BAZZ AND KEYBOARDIST HIKMAT QASSAR WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ARDUOUS JOURNEY THAT HALF A MILLION SYRIANS HAVE TAKEN THIS YEAR. TWO MONTHS LATER MAGHREBI ADMITTED THAT AS SOME THE FIRST ASYLUM SEEKERS TO REACH CROATIA THEY UNKNOWINGLY WALKED THROUGH BORDER AREAS FULL OF LANDMINES JUST PRIOR TO THE ARRIVAL OF MASSES OF REFUGEES REROUTED BY HUNGARY??S BORDER CLOSURE. THE BAND LEFT TURKEY ON A VOLATILE RIDE IN A RUBBER DINGY TO GREECE BEFORE STARTING A LONG TREK THROUGH EUROPE THAT COMBINED HIKING PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND SMUGGLERS?? CARS. AND IN THE GRITTIEST FORM OF ROCK AND ROLL TRADITION THEY TURNED THEIR ODYSSEY IN SEARCH OF FREEDOM INTO A EUROPEAN TOUR PLAYING SHOWS TO HUNDREDS OF NEW FANS IN ZAGREB AND VIENNA ALONG THE WAY. MAGHREBI LIKES TO SAY HE LEAPED FROM AN INFLATABLE RAFT TO HAND OUT FREE COPIES OF THE GROUP??S JUST-RELEASED ALBUM TO SUNBATHING TOURISTS ON THE BEACH OF THE GREEK ISLAND OF LESBOS. HE CALLS THE IMPROMPTU CD RELEASE PARTY AMIDST THE EUPHORIA OF REACHING EUROPE A STATEMENT TO THE WORLD ABOUT SYRIA??S REFUGEES. ??THIS TRIP IS NOT ABOUT BEING VICTIMS THE POOR PEOPLE. IT??S ABOUT BEING FREE? SAYS THE LANKY BEARDED VOCALIST AS HE LIGHTS A HAND-ROLLED CIGARETTE. ¯¨??WE ARE SOME OF THE MOST CULTURED PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND WE CAN BRING THAT TO PEOPLE HERE.? THE BAND??S NAME IS ARABIC FOR ??BREAD OF THE NATION? A PHRASE THAT MAGHREBI ADAPTS TO DEFINE COLLECTIVELY THOSE FLEEING TO EUROPE IN NUMBERS NOT SEEN SINCE THE SECOND WORLD WAR. ¯¨??WE ARE THE KHEBEZ OF THE DAWLE? HE SAID THERE ON THE GRASS IN SERBIA STRETCHING OUT AS RADIO HEAD??S ??OK COMPUTER? ALBUM BLARED FROM PORTABLE SPEAKERS CONNECTED TO HIS SMARTPHONE. ON KHEBEZ DAWLE??S OWN RECORDING THE ARABIC LYRICS TELL A STORY OF THE SHATTERING OF REVOLUTIONARY DREAMS AND THE GRUELING TRAUMA OF CIVIL WAR SET TO INTENSE POST-ROCK INSTRUMENTAL CRESCENDOS MIXED WITH THE SAMPLED SOUNDS OF THE CONFLICT. MAGHREBI CALLS IT A WITNESS??S ACCOUNT OF THE WAR. THE ALBUM LEADS YOU THROUGH SYRIA??S SPIRALLING DESCENT FROM THE OPTIMISM AND HOPE OF THE REVOLUTION INTO ANGER AT A REGIME THAT DROWNED PROTESTS IN BLOOD AND FINALLY THE ALIENATION OF BEING LOST AMID A FRACTURED SECTARIAN CIVIL WAR. SONGS ABOUT SELF-DISCOVERY AND EUPHORIA IN THE STREETS CARRY A LONGING FOR THE HOPES OF A WORLD THAT HAS BEEN SHATTERED. MAGHREBI??S VOCALS PLEAD WITH HIS COUNTRY TO REJECT RULE THROUGH VICTIMIZATION AND TORMENT. ??THEY??VE KILLED ME! AND THEN THEY BLAME ME FOR TELLING? HE SINGS IN THE TRACK ??BETA??AMMER.? ??IN THE DARKNESS THERE IS NO LIFE BUT FOR A VICTIM AND THEIR TORMENTOR? HIS VOICE REVERBERATES IN ARABIC OVER SCREAMING GUITARS. MAGREHBI HOPES THAT WHILE THE LYRICS CONFRONT ARABIC LISTENERS WITH THE SEARCH FOR MEANING IN SYRIA??S MADNESS THE MUSIC CONVEYS THE SAME EXPERIENCE TO AN INTERNATIONAL AUDIENCE THROUGH ITS SOUND. ??WE WANT THE MUSIC ITSELF TO BE A LANGUAGE SO YOU HEAR IT AND UNDERSTAND WHAT WE ARE UNDERSTANDING? HE SAYS. THERE ON THE PATCH OF GRASS AS THE GUYS SIPPED CANS OF BEER AND TOOK TURNS STRUMMING ON A GUITAR THEY PICKED UP IN ATHENS IT WOULD BE EASY TO MISTAKE THEM FOR HIPSTERS HANGING OUT IN A NEW YORK PARK. BUT HERE AMONG HUNDREDS OF ASYLUM SEEKERS BUSTLING AROUND THE TOWN CLOAKED IN THE SHADOW OF TOWERING TITO-ERA SOCIALIST APARTMENT BLOCKS THERE WAS NO QUESTION THESE HUDDLES MASSES WERE A LONG LONG WAY FROM LADY LIBERTY. I FIRST MET MAGHREBI LAST JUNE AT A HOUSE PARTY IN BEIRUT??S CHRISTIAN NEIGHBORHOOD OF GEITAWI. THE BAND WAS PREPARING TO RELEASE ITS FIRST ALBUM BUT AFTER TWO YEARS IN BEIRUT THE INSTITUTIONAL AND SOCIAL DISCRIMINATION AGAINST SYRIANS HAD WORN MAGHREBI DOWN. LEANING ON THE KITCHEN COUNTER WHILE ACTIVISTS ARTISTS AND JOURNALISTS SWIRLED ABOUT HE NOTED THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE STRONG SUPPORT THAT THE BAND RECEIVED FROM THE LOCAL ARTISTIC COMMUNITY AND THE DEBILITATING GOVERNMENT RESTRICTIONS THAT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST SYRIAN REFUGEES. BAND MEMBERS HAD DIFFICULTY FINDING STABLE INCOME AND BECAUSE OF RESTRICTIONS ON SYRIANS WORKING IN LEBANON EARNING A LIVING FROM THEIR MUSIC WAS UNSTABLE AND UNDER THE TABLE. TWO MONTHS LATER THEIR ALBUM WAS RELEASED TO LOCAL FANFARE THEIR DRUMMER SPLIT FROM THE GROUP AND MOST OF THEM WERE HEADING TO TURKEY AFTER SELLING THEIR EQUIPMENT TO PAY FOR THE JOURNEY. MAGHREBI REFLECTING ON HIS JOURNEY FORM BEIRUT FROM BUKAREVAC CALLED IT ??THE HARDEST REHEARSAL FOR EUROPE.? AND FOR SOME IT WAS HARDER THAN OTHERS. GUITARIST BASHAR DARWISH COULDN??T LEAVE WITH THE REST OF HIS BAND MATES BECAUSE HIS DESERTION FROM BASHAR AL-ASSAD??S SYRIAN GOVERNMENT FORCES AND AN ESCAPE FROM THE COUNTRY ORGANIZED BY A FREE SYRIAN ARMY LEFT HIM WITHOUT A SYRIAN PASSPORT. IT WASN??T UNTIL NOVEMBER THAT HE WAS ABLE TO LEAVE FOR ISTANBUL AFTER RELAXED PASSPORT REGULATIONS FOR SYRIANS OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY TOOK EFFECT. DARWISH HAD MET THE REST OF THE GROUP WHILE HE WAS PLAYING IN A DAMASCUS HARD ROCK BAND CALLED ANA. THESE WERE THE DAYS BEFORE THE UPRISING AND CIVIL WAR AND HE WAS STUDYING MUSIC AT THE CONSERVATORY IN DAMASCUS. PLAYING IN THE UNDERGROUND ROCK SCENE WAS FULL OF HURDLES. THE REGIME HAD A BUREAUCRATIC AND POLITICIZED PROCESS FOR GETTING PERMISSION TO PLAY GIGS NOT AN EASY TASK FOR A METAL HEAD WHO CITES PANTERA AND SLIPKNOT AS HIS INFLUENCES. ??YOU HAD TO KNOW SOMEONE WHO KNEW SOMEONE AND WE COULDN??T PLAY THE HEAVY STUFF? HE TOLD ME ON A SKYPE CALL FROM ISTANBUL IN NOVEMBER. ??YOU ALSO HAD TO HAVE A SONG ABOUT EITHER SYRIA OR PALESTINE??. SO WE DID ONE ABOUT PALESTINE? HE CHUCKLES. A SONG ABOUT SYRIA WOULDN??T ENDEAR THE GROUP TO THE REGIME. BUT IN 2010 DARWISH WAS CONSCRIPTED FORCED TO DROP OUT OF THE CONSERVATORY AND SERVE AS AN ARMY RADIO OPERATOR. WHEN THE MASS PROTESTS OF THE ARAB SPRING REACHED DAMASCUS IN THE SPRING OF 2011 HE SAYS HE WAS SUPPORTIVE BUT UNABLE TO JOIN. ??I??M ANGRY THAT I COULDN??T PARTICIPATE? HE TOLD ME. MAGRHEBI WAS IN THE OPPOSITE POSITION NOT SERVING IN THE MILITARY AND A VOCAL SUPPORTER OF THE REVOLT. HE STILL CITES THE HOPE OF THOSE EARLY DAYS OF PROTEST AS INSPIRATION FOR MANY OF HIS LYRICS. AS REVOLUTION TURNED INTO A BLOODY MULTIFACETED REGIONAL PROXY WAR THE BAND LEFT FOR LEBANON. ONE BY ONE THEY FLED BLOODSHED DODGING CONSCRIPTION OR DESERTING THEIR ARMY POSTS. BAZZ AND QASSAR FLED THE COUNTRY IN 2013 WITHIN DAYS OF GETTING THEIR CALL-UP NOTICES. MAGHREBI LEFT AROUND THE SAME TIME. DARWISH WAS SERVING IN A NON-COMBAT UNIT SO TRIED AT FIRST TO KEEP HIS HEAD DOWN AND SIT OUT THE WAR IN A RADIO BUNKER. HOWEVER IN 2012 HE GOT TRANSFER ORDERS TO A COMBAT UNIT AND DESERTED. FOR SIX NERVE-RACKING MONTHS HE HID OUT IN DAMASCUS UNTIL THE FSA WAS ABLE TO GET HIM OUT OF THE CITY AND GUIDE HIM ON FOOT THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS TO LEBANON. ARRIVING IN BEIRUT WITHOUT ANY DOCUMENTS AND ONLY THE CLOTHES ON HIS BACK DARWISH FOUND A NEW LIFE FULL OF HARASSMENT AND RESTRICTION IN A COUNTRY THAT STILL DOESN??T OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZE ITS OVER ONE MILLION SYRIANS AS REFUGEES. IT WAS IN THIS CONTEXT THAT KHEBEZ DAWLE WAS LAUNCHED AND CARVED OUT A PLACE FOR ITSELF IN THE CITY??S VIBRANT NIGHTLIFE. ??AT FIRST I WAS HAPPY TO ESCAPE AND FELT FREE BUT AFTER THAT I STARTED TO FACE PROBLEMS? DARWISH SAYS SITTING ON THE FLOOR OF A FRIEND??S ISTANBUL APARTMENT SURROUNDED BY KEYBOARDS AND MIXERS. ??I GOT ARRESTED BY THE LEBANESE AUTHORITIES BECAUSE I WAS ILLEGAL AND DIDN??T HAVE PAPERS? HE SAYS. THEN HE WAS ARRESTED A SECOND TIME TRYING TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY ON A FAKE SYRIAN PASSPORT. THE PRO-ASSAD LEBANESE SHIA ORGANIZATIONS HEZBOLLAH AND AMAL SUSPECTING HE WAS A DESERTER TARGETED HIM FOR QUESTIONING ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS. THE REST OF THE BAND REACHED BERLIN IN OCTOBER AND ARE NOW NAVIGATING THE IMMIGRATION PROCESS WHILE SETTLING INTO A NEW LIFE. THEY ARE ALREADY PLANNING AN OFFICIAL EUROPEAN TOUR FOR SPRING PART OF WHICH WILL HAVE THEM REVERSE THEIR MIGRATION PATH FROM CENTRAL EUROPE BACK TO THE BALKANS AND THEN ONTO GREECE. MAGHREBI CONTENDS THAT WHILE THEY WERE ORIGINALLY PLANNING ON STAYING IN VIENNA THE BAND WAS DRAWN TO BERLIN??S INTERNATIONALISM VIBRANT ART SCENE AND OPENNESS TO REFUGEES. ??IN BERLIN I FEEL LIKE A GLOBAL CITIZEN LIKE I CAN EXPRESS MY FEARS AND HOPES AND ART? HE SAID ON SKYPE FROM THE GERMAN CAPITAL SHORTLY AFTER THE PARIS TERRORIST ATTACKS. DESPITE THE WELCOMING COSMOPOLITAN ARRIVAL HE SAYS HE??S FELT AN INCREASE IN HOSTILITY DIRECTED AT SYRIANS SINCE THE MASSACRE IN FRANCE EVEN THOUGH NONE OF THE KNOWN ATTACKERS WAS IN FACT SYRIAN. FOR MAGHREBI LIKE MANY REFUGEES THE POST-PARIS-ATTACK CLIMATE HAS NOT ONLY CREATED FEAR OF A BACKLASH ALONGSIDE HORROR AT THE CARNAGE THAT ISIS UNLEASHED BUT IT ALSO CONJURED UP THE FAMILIAR FEELING THAT THE WAR CANNOT BE ESCAPED. ??I DON??T WANT TO SEE A PIECE OF WHAT??S HAPPENED IN SYRIA HAPPEN IN EUROPE? MAGHREBI SAID. MEANWHILE DARWISH REMAINS STRANDED IN TURKEY AS THE ROUGH WINTER WATERS OF THE MEDITERRANEAN MAKE CROSSING TO GREECE NOW ESPECIALLY DANGEROUS. HE WORRIES THAT THE SPIKING HOSTILITY TOWARDS REFUGEES SINCE THE ATTACKS AND NEW EUROPEAN UNION AGREEMENTS WITH TURKEY TO STOP ASYLUM SEEKERS FROM LEAVING FOR GREECE WILL PREVENT HIM FROM REJOINING THE BAND. THE UN REFUGEE AGENCY REPORTED FROM LESBOS THIS WEEK THAT ??DESPITE STRONG WINDS AND CHOPPY WAVES ON DEC. 30 DOZENS OF FAMILIES CONTINUED TO LAND.? THEY WERE COMING IN ??OVERSTUFFED INFLATABLE BOATS DESIGNED TO CARRY JUST EIGHT PEOPLE.? SOME CARRIED MORE THAN 60. DARWISH HAS APPLIED FOR A EU VISA BUT THE BAND HAS TRIED AND BEEN DENIED THEM IN THE PAST DESPITE INVITATIONS TO PLAY AT EUROPEAN FESTIVALS. HE IS TORN BETWEEN THE STRESS OF MAKING IT TO GERMANY FOR THE TOUR AND WAITING FOR A CALMER SPRING SEA. SO LIVING IN LIMBO AND DISTRACTING HIMSELF WITH SOLO PROJECTS HE PREPARES FOR THE LIKELY CLANDESTINE JOURNEY OF WHAT THE BAND HOPES IS THE FINAL STAGE OF ITS ROCK AND REFUGE TOUR. ,4351.0

THE ANTI-ABORTION ACTIVIST IDENTIFIED AS GREG POUND WAS SPEAKING MONDAY IN FRONT OF THE FLORIDA HOUSE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SUBCOMMITTEE EXPRESSING HIS SUPPORT FOR HB 865. THAT BILL WOULD MAKE ABORTION COMPLETELY ILLEGAL IN FLORIDA EXCEPT WHEN PREGNANCY THREATENS A WOMAN??S LIFE OR INTERFERES WITH THE TREATMENT OF AN ??ALREADY-LIFE THREATENING DISEASE???AND ONLY THEN IF TWO PHYSICIANS ??CERTIFY IN WRITING? THAT THIS IS THE CASE. THE BILL WOULD ALSO REMOVE THE STIPULATION THAT ABORTION IS PERMITTED IN ORDER TO ??AVERT A SERIOUS RISK OF SUBSTANTIAL AND IRREVERSIBLE PHYSICAL IMPAIRMENT OF A MAJOR BODILY FUNCTION? CLAIMING THAT THIS EXCEPTION FOR A WOMAN??S HEALTH ??IMPEDES THE STATE??S PROTECTION OF VIABLE UNBORN HUMAN LIFE.? THE NET EFFECT: ABORTION WOULD BE ILLEGAL FOR ANY WOMAN WHO WOULD NOT DIE FROM PREGNANCY OR CHILDBIRTH. THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION WOULD ALSO SLAP ANYONE WHO PERFORMS AN ABORTION OR OPERATES AN ABORTION CLINIC WITH A FIRST-DEGREE FELONY CHARGE WHICH COULD CARRY A PRISON SENTENCE OF UP TO 30 YEARS. AS THE MIAMI HERALD REPORTS THE PATENTLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL BILL EASILY CLEARED THE SUBCOMMITTEE BY AN 8-3 VOTE. THE SUPREME COURT HAS REPEATEDLY RULED THAT STATES CANNOT PLACE AN ??UNDUE BURDEN? ON WOMEN SEEKING AN ABORTION BEFORE FETAL VIABILITY LET ALONE TRY TO BAN IT ENTIRELY AT EVERY STAGE. BUT FOR ONE CHRISTIAN LAWMAKER??AND APPARENTLY A RACIST ACTIVIST WITH TOO MUCH TIME ON HIS HANDS??THE SUPREME COURT??S FINAL SAY IS REALLY MORE OF A SUGGESTION. ??THE LEGISLATURE URGES THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT TO OVERTURN ROE V. WADE (1973) AND PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHERN (SIC.) PENNSYLVANIA V. CASEY (1992)? HB 865 READS.

THE BILL REFERS TO ??HUMAN LIFE? AS ??THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL GIFT FROM GOD? CITING THESE ARGUMENTS AS JUSTIFICATION FOR FLORIDIANS TO ??EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT TO SELF-GOVERNMENT? AND ??PROHIBIT UNNECESSARY ABORTION.? THE RELIGIOUS TENOR OF THE BILL IS NOT A SURPRISE GIVEN ITS SPONSOR REPUBLICAN STATE REPRESENTATIVE CHARLES VAN ZANT. A MINISTER AND GRADUATE OF THE SOUTHERN BAPTIST THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY VAN ZANT FAMOUSLY CLAIMED IN 2014 THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF COMMON CORE EDUCATION IN FLORIDA WOULD ??ATTRACT EVERY ONE OF YOUR CHILDREN TO BECOME AS HOMOSEXUAL AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN.? LEST ANYONE SHAKE THEIR HEAD AND SAY ??ONLY IN FLORIDA? FOUR STATES HAVE PASSED ??TRIGGER LAWS? THAT WOULD MAKE ABORTION ILLEGAL IN MOST CASES IF ROE V. WADE WERE OVERTURNED. ELEVEN STATES HAVE BANS PRE-DATING ROE THAT ARE STILL TECHNICALLY STATE LAW AND EIGHT OTHERS HAVE LEGISLATION EXPRESSING AN INTENT TO RESTRICT ABORTION TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY ANY FUTURE SUPREME COURT ROE REVERSAL ACCORDING TO THE GUTTMACHER INSTITUTE. VAN ZANT??S BILL IS NOT EVEN THE FIRST TO FLY DIRECTLY IN THE FACE OF THE SUPREME COURT??S GUIDANCE. LOUISIANA UTAH AND NORTH DAKOTA HAVE ALL ATTEMPTED TO IMPLEMENT BLATANTLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL ABORTION BANS AFTER ROE V. WADE. MOST RECENTLY NORTH DAKOTA PASSED A ??FETAL HEARTBEAT? LAW IN 2013 THAT WAS INTENDED TO BAN ABORTION AFTER SIX WEEKS. IT WAS BLOCKED IN FEDERAL COURT LAST YEAR AND THE SUPREME COURT DENIED AN APPEAL TO THAT DECISION EARLIER THIS WEEK PREVENTING THE LEGISLATION FROM EVER BEING ENFORCED. IN THE EVENT THAT VAN ZANT??S BILL MAKES IT THROUGH SUBCOMMITTEES AND BECOMES LAW FLORIDA WOULD JOIN THE LOFTY RANKS OF STATES THAT PASS EXTREME ABORTION BANS KNOWING THAT THEY WILL BE IMMEDIATELY STRUCK DOWN. FOR NOW THE BILL??S MAIN CLAIM TO FAME IS THAT IT BROUGHT POUND A MAN CONCERNED FOR THE FATE OF ??WHITE CULTURE? TO THE FLOOR OF THE FLORIDA HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. IN HIS REMARKS MONDAY WHICH HAVE SINCE SPREAD ONLINE POUND RAMBLED ON ABOUT MEXICANS AND MUSLIMS??NEITHER OF WHOM ??KILL THEIR BABIES? HE CLAIMS?? AND HOW A LOW FERTILITY RATE IN THE UNITED STATES SPELLS DOOM FOR THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY. HIS CONFUSING REMARKS SEEM TO RUN COUNTER TO A SENTIMENT SHARED BY THE MANY ANTI-ABORTION CONSPIRACY THEORISTS WHO ARGUE THAT ABORTION IS A FORM OF ??BLACK GENOCIDE FOR POUND ABORTION NEEDS TO BE STOPPED TO SAVE THE WHITE PEOPLE. HIS CONCLUSION: ??IT??S EITHER REPENT OR PERISH AMERICA. THAT??S THE WAY IT IS.? UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA STUDENTS AND ALUMNI MAY RECOGNIZE POUND AS A CAMPUS PREACHER. ??YOU NEED TO BE FREE FROM YOUR WHITE SAVAGE MINDSET!? HE CAN BE HEARD SHOUTING IN ONE STUDENT??S VIDEO PROJECT ON THE ACTIVIST. ??DID GOD CREATE ADAM AND EVE OR ADAM AND STEVE?? HE ASKS IN ANOTHER YOUTUBE VIDEO. ACCORDING TO A 2009 TAMPA BAY TIMES REPORT POUND THEN RUNNING AS A WRITE-IN CANDIDATE FOR SHERIFF OF PINELLAS COUNTY WAS CHARGED WITH AGGRAVATED STALKING AND VIOLATION OF A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE INJUNCTION FOR HOLDING UP SIGNS NEXT TO HIS CHILDREN??S SCHOOL BUS AFTER THEY WERE REMOVED FROM HIS CUSTODY IN 2007. THOSE CHARGES DIDN??T STOP HIM FROM RUNNING FOR SHERIFF AGAIN IN 2012 AND RELEASING A CAMPAIGN VIDEO FILMED IN FRONT OF A TOWERING CRUCIFIX.

HIS SMUG POINDEXTER AFFECT HIS SMARM SANCTIMONY AND GENERAL DERPINESS ALL GRATE ON ME. THERE'S NO DOUBT HE'S SMART BUT WHILE SMART IS NECESSARY IT'S NOT NECESSARILY SUFFICIENT. THAT SAID I'D RATHER TED CRUZ SERVE AS LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD FOR EIGHT YEARS THAN HAVE DONALD TRUMP IN THAT ROLE FOR EIGHT MINUTES.?Ÿ YET THE INEVITABLE BLOODY CONFLICT BETWEEN CRUZ AND TRUMP THAT BROKE TO THE SURFACE AFTER THE LAST REPUBLICAN DEBATE RAISES REAL QUESTIONS ABOUT CRUZ'S POLITICAL JUDGMENT THAT REPUBLICAN VOTERS NEED TO EXAMINE. IN AUGUST OF LAST YEAR I DESCRIBED CRUZ'S BEHAVIOR TOWARD TRUMP AS ??FEEDING THE ALLIGATOR IN HOPES THAT IT EATS HIM LAST.??Ÿ AS PAINFUL AS IT IS FOR HIS FANS TO ADMIT IT THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON TO BLAME FOR THE SITUATION IN WHICH CRUZ NOW FINDS HIMSELF AND THAT'S TED CRUZ. FOR SIX MONTHS NOW CRUZ HAS PLAYED THE ROLE OF EAGER UNDERSTUDY AND TRUMP LICKSPITTLE PRAISING NEARLY EVERYTHING THAT SPEWS FROM TRUMP'S MOUTH. NOT ONLY DID CRUZ SET A LAND-SPEED RECORD RACING OFF TO TRUMP TOWER TO PAY OBEISANCE TO THE DONALD EARLY IN THE PROCESS HE HAS TAKEN ALMOST EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO LAVISH PRAISE ON EVEN TRUMP'S MOST RIDICULOUS AND POLITICALLY DEADLY POLICIES. HE HAS EMBRACED AND AMPLIFIED MESSAGES THAT ARE POISONOUS AMONG WOMEN HISPANICS AND EVEN LIMITED-GOVERNMENT CONSERVATIVES. CRUZ HAS OCCASIONALLY STEPPED BACK FROM THE BRINK BUT ALWAYS WHILE SHOVELING ON FULSOME PRAISE FOR THE NOTORIOUS GAME-SHOW HOST AND CON ARTIST LEADING THE REPUBLICAN FIELD. CRUZ MADE HIS BET AND HIS BED EARLY. HE OBSERVED THAT TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS WERE PRECISELY LIKE OBAMA'S 2008 FANS: CULTLIKE FANATIC AND INSTANTLY FILLED WITH WHITE-HOT RAGE AT THE SLIGHTEST INSULT TO THE ONE. CRUZ RARELY SAID A HARSH WORD ABOUT TRUMP GAMBLING THAT WHEN THE COLLAPSE CAME THAT HE WOULD INHERIT THE DONALD'S VOTERS. UNTIL HIS OBLIQUE AND WEAK-KNEED ??FONZIE? AND ??NEW YORK VALUES? SNIPES AT TRUMP CRUZ COULD HAVE EASILY BEEN MISTAKEN FOR A TRUMP SURROGATE DISPLAYING THE SAME OBSEQUIOUS BOWING-AND-SCRAPING AS TRUMP'S FLYING-MONKEY MINIONS DAN SCAVINO MICHAEL COHEN ROGER ??NUMBER TWO? STONE AND ??GRIFTER BARBIE? KATRINA PIERSON. THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME CRUZ HAS DISPLAYED WEAK POLITICAL JUDGMENT. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU THINK OF THE POLITICAL AND IDEOLOGICAL FIGHTS HE'S LOST (AND HE'S LOST ALMOST ALL OF THEM) HE MISREAD HARRY REID MITCH MCCONNELL BARACK OBAMA AND HIS COLLEAGUES IN THE U.S. SENATE IN THE SAME WAY HE MISREAD TRUMP. WHEN YOUR POLITICAL OPPONENTS HAVE A GUN TO YOUR HEAD AND CAN PULL THE TRIGGER AT ANY MOMENT THEY CHOOSE COUNT ON THEM TO DO SO. SO WHILE DONALD TRUMP'S ATTACKS ON TED CRUZ ARE PATENTLY ABSURD (PARTICULARLY TRUMP'S LATEST FORAY INTO BIRTHERISM) THEY'RE NOT UNEXPECTED.?Ÿ AS MUCH AS CRUZ TOUCHES CONSERVATIVE HOT BUTTONS HIS RECORD OF NOT READING THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE PROPERLY AND HIS INABILITY TO CORRECTLY IDENTIFY RISKS SHOULD MAKE ANYONE PAUSE WHEN CONSIDERING A CONTEST AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON. CRUZ NEEDED TO THINK OF TRUMP'S BEHAVIOR AS HIGHLANDER NOT FONZIE. THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE. TRUMP WON'T RELINQUISH HIS HOLD ON THE LEAD IT HAS TO BE TAKEN FROM HIM. THE IRONY OF THE HATED \MODERATE? JEB BUSH BEING THE ONLY CANDIDATE PUTTING REAL MONEY BEHIND ADS HITTING TRUMP (FAR TOO LITTLE FAR TOO LATE AND FEATURING AN IDIOTIC DETOUR ATTACKING MARCO RUBIO) IS RICH. CRUZ HAS THE RESOURCES AND THE CONSERVATIVE PEDIGREE TO BRING A CASE AGAINST TRUMP BUT HIS POLITICAL CALCULUS HAS BEEN SO WRONG FOR SO LONG THAT HE MERELY DELAYED THE DONALD'S STRIKE AGAINST HIM. WHEN THE STRIKE CAME THE TRUMP TROLL PARTY WENT INTO OVERDRIVE AGAINST CRUZ. TED CRUZ A MAN WHO CHECKED EVERY BOX ON THEIR AGENDA (AND WAS PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE AS LONG AS HIS LIPS WERE PLANTED FIRMLY ON TRUMP'S POSTERIOR) WAS SUDDENLY ANATHEMA. CRUZ MADE A POLITICAL CATEGORY ERROR IN ASSESSING THE TRUMP SUPPORTERS HE SO COVETED HE THOUGHT THEY WERE DRIVEN BY THE TALK-RADIO AND FEVER-SWAMP MEDIA COMPLEX AND A HATRED OF THE ESTABLISHMENT ALONE. HE WAS WRONG THEY'RE ALSO DRIVEN BY THEIR DESIRE TO BE PART OF TRUMP'S PERSONALITY CULT. IF THERE'S ONE THING NO ONE WILL EVER MISTAKE TED CRUZ FOR IT'S A CHARISMATIC CULT LEADER. CRUZ SCANS MORE AS THE ACCOUNTANT FOR THE CHARISMATIC CULT LEADER THAN THE GUY LADLING OUT THE KOOL AID. CRUZ ALSO BELIEVED THAT THE WEAPONIZED PURITY-POSSE OF BREITBART ??NEWS? AND THE REST OF THE BIRTHER-TRUTHER-SCAMPAC RAGE-DRIVEN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT FEEDS OFF THE CREDULOUS AND THE CRETINOUS WOULD NEVER TURN ON HIM.?Ÿ HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN PAYING ATTENTION MANY OF THESE OUTLETS HAVE STOPPED BEING ABOUT ADVANCING CONSERVATISM OR SERVING AS A COUNTERWEIGHT TO LIBERAL MEDIA. THEY'RE ABOUT MONETIZING FURY EVEN IF IT MEANS MARGINALIZING CANDIDATES AND MESSAGES THAT COULD MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE A GOVERNING CONSERVATIVE MAJORITY AND RETAKE THE WHITE HOUSE. THEY'VE ADVOCATED FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS THAT ALL CANDIDATES NOT NAMED DONALD TRUMP MUST BE DESTROYED. NOT FOR IDEOLOGICAL OR POLITICAL REASONS BUT BECAUSE NO ONE ELSE BRINGS IN THOSE SWEET CLICKS THAT AD REVENUE AND THAT ROI ON THE SCAMPAC EMAIL LISTS. AT THE POINT TRUMP ENTERED THIS RACE I ASSESSED HOW THE MAJOR ACTORS IN THE GOP WOULD RESPOND TO HIM. I WAS WRONG. I BELIEVED THE CAMPAIGNS WOULD INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY RECOGNIZE THE DANGER DONALD TRUMP POSED TO THEIR CANDIDACIES. I BELIEVED THAT THE DONOR CLASS WOULD CRINGE AT THE VAST THAT DONALD TRUMP POSES TO THE ENTIRE REPUBLICAN PARTY ITS BRAND ITS PROSPECTS FOR EXPANSION AND THE NATION. I BELIEVED CONSERVATIVES WOULD REJECT A MAN WHO DEMONSTRABLY LOATHED ALMOST EVERY CONSERVATIVE VALUE AND PRINCIPLE UNTIL HE DECIDED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. THE CANDIDATES WHO UNDERSTOOD THE RISKS OF TRUMP DIDN'T HAVE THE RESOURCES BUT THOSE WITH THE RESOURCES TO FIGHT BACK INSTEAD OPERATED FROM A COMBINATION OF POLITICAL COWARDICE (AS IN THE CASE OF CRUZ) OR IN UTTERLY MISPLACED HOSTILITY TOWARD MARCO RUBIO IN THE CASE OF BUSH. ALL OF THEM HOWEVER HAVE COME TO REALIZE IN THE WORDS OF GOVERNOR RICK PERRY THAT TRUMP IS A CANCER ON THE CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. UNFORTUNATELY AND REGRETTABLY THEIR RESPONSES HAVE BEEN LATE SLOW FEARFUL AND INADEQUATE. HOWEVER IT'S UNLIKELY VOTERS WILL FORGET THAT ONLY ONE MAN IN THE FIELD EMBRACED TRUMP FROM THE BEGINNING: TED CRUZ. CRUZ WITH HIS REPUTATION FOR INTELLECTUAL HORSEPOWER AND A BRILLIANT LEGAL AND STRATEGIC TURN OF MIND TODAY LOOKS LIKE A FOOL AS TRUMP'S MEDIA ENABLERS AND POLITICAL LEGIONS TURN ON THE SENATOR FROM TEXAS TEARING AT HIS POLITICAL CARCASS LIKE HYENAS. CRUZ BET THE POLITICAL FARM ON WINNING IOWA AND HE MAY STILL PREVAIL THERE IT'S UP IN THE AIR WHETHER TRUMP'S CELEBRITY GAME-SHOW HOST MOJO CAN OFFSET WHAT IS WIDELY REPORTED TO BE A POTEMKIN FIELD OPERATION. IF TRUMP CONTINUES HIS ATTACKS WITH THEIR CURRENT INTENSITY AND VITRIOL THE ONLY TWO THINGS MIGHT SAVE HIM. FIRST CRUZ MAY GARNER POLITICAL CREDIT FOR BEING THE FIRST CANDIDATE TO ENGAGE IN PROTRACTED POLITICAL COMBAT WITH TRUMP EVEN THOUGH IT'S ONLY BECAUSE TRUMP HAS HIS BACK AGAINST THE WALL. VOTERS MAY REWARD HIM FOR DROPPING THE PRETENSE THAT TRUMP IS JUST ANOTHER REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE OR THAT THE DONALD HAS ANY KIND OF CONSERVATIVE BONA FIDES. SECOND IF THE VAST ALL-IN-FOR-TRUMP ??CONSERVATIVE? TALK-RADIO AND NEW-RIGHT MEDIA INFRASTRUCTURE SUDDENLY TURNS ON THE DONALD IN THE COMING DAYS (AND INDEED THEY MIGHT ) TRUMP MIGHT LOSE SOME OF THE VITAL MEDIA ADRENALINE THAT SUSTAINS HIM.?Ÿ ON MONDAY TALK RADIO WAS IN A PAROXYSM OF AGONY TRYING TO MEMORY-HOLE MONTHS OF TRUMP CHEERLEADING AND SNAPPING INTO A DEFENSIVE POSTURE FOR CRUZ.?Ÿ YOU COULD SENSE THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD THE MONSTER THEY HELPED CREATE IS OUT OF CONTROL AND NOW IT'S QUESTION OF WHETHER THEY CAN STOP IT.?Ÿ TED CRUZ MAY BE BRILLIANT BUT THE POLITICAL GAMBLE HE??S TAKEN IS ONE ONLY A FOOL WOULD MAKE. WIN OR LOSE IN IOWA IT'S HARD TO SEE HOW CRUZ'S LACK OF POLITICAL JUDGMENT WON'T HAUNT HIM EITHER NOW OR IN THE GENERAL ELECTION. """,24227.0

372,9770369.0,2016-01-09T05:05:00+00:00,GET TOUGH ON DRONES BEFORE PEOPLE DIE,IT WAS A QUIET OCTOBER AFTERNOON IN THE SMALL SEASIDE VILLAGE WHERE I LIVE SAG HARBOR ON THE EASTERN END OF LONG ISLAND. THE SUMMER SWARMS WHO INUNDATE OUR STREETS??LOCALS CALL THEM ??THE MARTIANS???HAD LONG SINCE DISAPPEARED. OUR DOWNTOWN IS BASICALLY ONE SHORT STRETCH OF MAIN STREET NEAR THE WATER AND ONE OF ITS FEATURES IS A VINTAGE VARIETY STORE WHERE THE PRICES MAY EXCEED THE ORIGINAL NICKEL AND DIME LIMITS BUT THE PACE OF TRANSACTIONS REMAINS UNHURRIED AND CIVILIZED. THEN SUDDENLY THIS NORMAL ROCKWELL NIRVANA WAS RUDELY JOLTED BY THE IMPACT OF AN UNCONTROLLED FLYING OBJECT. RIGHT OUTSIDE THE VARIETY STORE A SMALL DRONE CRASHED AND BURNED ON THE SIDEWALK??LUCKILY NOT HITTING ANYBODY. A CONDO DEVELOPER USED THE DRONE TO PROVIDE AERIAL VIEWS OF A NEW PROPERTY BUT ITS ??PILOT? HAD LOST CONTROL AND IT FELL OUT OF THE SKY. THERE ARE MIGHTY PORTENTS FROM THIS TINY CAMEO: THE ABRUPT INTRUSION OF AN UNRULY MACHINE INTO A SANCTUARY OF CIVILIZATION THE SYMBOLISM OF ??LOSS OF CONTROL? THAT DOESN??T SIMPLY APPLY TO DRONES BUT TO HOW PEOPLE ARE FEELING ABOUT SO MUCH IN THEIR LIVES AND THE SENSE THAT NOBODY REALLY KNOWS HOW TO PRESERVE THE PRIVACY OF INDIVIDUALS AGAINST THE EVER-GROWING REACH OF TECHNOLOGY??WHETHER IN THE HANDS OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY AMAZON OR A DRONE OPERATED BY A PEEPING TOM. IN SAG HARBOR THE MAYOR DECIDED THAT THAT THE VILLAGE NEEDED TO IMPOSE ITS OWN RULES ON DRONES: THEY SHOULD NOT BE USED TO TAKE PHOTOS OF PEOPLE WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT THEY SHOULD NOT FLY OVER PRIVATE PROPERTY WITHOUT CONSENT THEY SHOULD BE BANNED FROM THE AIR SPACE OVER PARKS UNLESS GIVEN PERMISSION. IN THEORY A VILLAGE LIKE THIS THE SMALLEST FORM OF MUNICIPAL AUTHORITY IN THE LAND COULD HAVE ENACTED THESE LIMITS ON THE OPERATION OF DRONES BECAUSE THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION HAD SIGNALLY FAILED TO DO SO. ??THE FEDS COULD PREEMPT LOCAL GOVERNMENT? ADVISED THE VILLAGE ATTORNEY ??BUT THEY HAVEN??T YET.? WELL THEY HAVE NOW. SEVERAL YEARS AFTER FIRST DELIBERATING ON THE PROBLEM OF DRONES THE FAA HAS FINALLY MOVED AND AS A RESULT THWARTED OR CHALLENGED THE EFFORTS UNDER WAY IN MANY VILLAGES TOWNS AND CITIES ACROSS THE LAND TO PASS THEIR OWN REGULATIONS. BASICALLY THE FAA INSISTS THAT IT IS IN CHARGE OF ANYTHING THAT FLIES. AND AS A FIRST STEP IT NOW REQUIRES ALL USERS OF RECREATIONAL DRONES (WEIGHING LESS THAN 55 LBS) TO REGISTER AND RECEIVE A NUMBER THROUGH WHICH THEY CAN BE TRACED. RECREATIONAL DRONES ARE ALSO SUPPOSED NOT TO FLY ABOVE 400 FEET AND ALWAYS REMAIN IN SIGHT OF THE OPERATOR. THE PROBLEM IS HOWEVER THAT THE FAA CAN DRAW UP AS MANY RULES AS IT LIKES BUT HAS NO MEANS OF ENFORCING THEM. THIS IS REMEMBER AN AGENCY THAT HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY FOUND WANTING IN THE WAY IT ENFORCES SAFETY STANDARDS IN THE AREA IN WHICH WE MOST DEPEND ON ITS VIGILANCE COMMERCIAL AVIATION. INDEED WHEN IT ATTEMPTS TO UNDERSTAND AND REGULATE NEW TECHNOLOGIES THE FAA SEEMS ILL PREPARED LACKING BOTH EXPERTISE AND ENOUGH STAFF. FOR EXAMPLE FAA INSPECTORS ARE OFTEN TOO WILLING TO ACCEPT UNTRIED TECHNOLOGY. THIS HAPPENED IN THE CASE OF THE BOEING 787 DREAMLINER AND ITS INNOVATIVE ELECTRICAL POWER SUPPLY SYSTEM. THE AGENCY CLEARED THE LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES THAT WERE CRUCIAL TO THIS SYSTEM EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD NEVER BEEN PROPERLY TESTED??AND TWO SERIOUS FIRE INCIDENTS CAUSED THE WHOLE 787 FLEET TO BE GROUNDED. THE FAILURE WAS ALSO CLEAR IN THE CASE OF THE VIRGIN GALACTIC ??SPACE TOURISM? PROJECT WHERE A CRASH OF THE PROTOTYPE SPACESHIPTWO REVEALED THAT THE AGENCY HAD BEEN LAX AND COMPLAISANT ON CRITICAL SAFETY ISSUES. BUT THIS FAA WEAKNESS HAS BEEN VISIBLE ON A FAR GREATER SCALE AS IT BEGAN SLOWLY TO COMPREHEND THE IMPACT OF SMALL DRONES??BOTH THOSE USED FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES (WEIGHING MORE THAN 55LBS) AND THOSE CLASSED AS RECREATIONAL. ALL ALONG THE AGENCY??S MINDSET HAS BEEN SCHIZOID. ONE SIDE OF ITS BRAIN OPERATED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF BUREAUCRATIC SOVEREIGNTY: IF IT FLIES WE MUST REGULATE IT. BUT THE OTHER SIDE OF ITS BRAIN THE PART THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING AND DEALING WITH RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES NEVER GOT UP TO SPEED. THE FAA??S BUREAUCRATS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SUSCEPTIBLE TO LOBBYING PRESSURES. JUST HOW POLITICAL AND COMMERCIAL INTERESTS INTERSECT WITH PROFESSIONAL OBLIGATIONS WITHIN THE AGENCY HAS NEVER BEEN EASY TO UNRAVEL BUT DRONES HAVE BROUGHT INTO PLAY NUMEROUS PRESSURES WITH DIFFERENT AND SOMETIMES CONTRADICTORY INTERESTS: FIRST THERE IS THE LEAST POWERFUL OF THESE INTERESTS THE ACADEMY OF MODEL AERONAUTICS. THEY REPRESENT THE LEGIONS OF HOBBYISTS WHO OFTEN DESIGN AND BUILD THEIR OWN DRONES AND REGARD THEMSELVES AS A CUT ABOVE THOSE WHO JUST BUY DRONES OUT OF THE BOX AND PROCEED TO LEARN AS THEY FLY??OR NOT AS THE CASE MAY BE. THE AMA ACTUALLY HAD A SUI GENERIS ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF DRONES. FROM THE 1950S IT WAS MODEL AIRPLANE DESIGNERS WHO PIONEERED REMOTE CONTROL BY RADIO FIRST USING COMPARATIVELY PRIMITIVE RADIO TECHNOLOGY BUT ULTIMATELY PROVIDING THE TECHNOLOGICAL FORERUNNERS OF MILITARY DRONES. AMA MEMBERS DON??T LIKE REGULATIONS IMPOSED FROM ABOVE??THEY BELIEVE THEY HAVE SHOWN THEMSELVES CAPABLE OF RESPONSIBLE SELF-REGULATION AND THEY CERTAINLY DON??T WANT TO BE TREATED AS THOUGH THEY ARE OPERATING ??TOYS.? MORE PERSISTENT CRITICS OF FAA REGULATION INCLUDE THE ASSOCIATION FOR UNMANNED VEHICLE SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL REPRESENTING THE MANUFACTURERS OF DRONES USED FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES AND THE REAL LOBBYING HEAVYWEIGHTS WHO SEE DRONES PROVIDING A WHOLE NEW LEVEL OF BUSINESS FOR THEM AMAZON AND GOOGLE. THEY WANT LIGHT TOUCH REGULATION THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO FULFILL WHAT THEY SEE AS THE TRUE COMMERCIAL DESTINY OF DRONES: A NEW AVIATION CATEGORY THAT CAN REVOLUTIONIZE FOR EXAMPLE THE DELIVERY OF SMALL PACKAGES AS WELL AS BRINGING INVALUABLE EYES IN THE SKY FOR THE AGRICULTURE ENERGY AND PUBLIC UTILITY INDUSTRIES. BUT ALL ALONG THE FAA DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE A CLEAR DISTINCTION BETWEEN WHAT IS A LEGITIMATE NEW CATEGORY OF AVIATION AND THE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT AND ESCALATING PROBLEM CREATED BY SO-CALLED RECREATIONAL DRONES. ON DECEMBER 17 THE FAA RELEASED A FACT SHEET OUTLINING HOW IT WOULD REGULATE BOTH RECREATIONAL AND COMMERCIAL DRONES. (DID ANYBODY AT THE AGENCY REALIZE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DATE THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE WRIGHT BROTHERS?? FIRST FLIGHT?) AT THE SAME TIME THE TRUE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM WAS REVEALED WITH A STUNNING NUMBER: THE CONSUMER TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION SAID THAT IT EXPECTED THAT 700000 DRONES WOULD BE SOLD IN THE U.S. IN 2015??AN INCREASE OF ALMOST TWO-THIRDS ON 2014. BEFORE THE FAA??S DECEMBER ANNOUNCEMENT MORE THAN 20 STATES HAD PASSED THEIR OWN DRONE LAWS AS HAVE MAJOR CITIES INCLUDING MIAMI CHICAGO AND LOS ANGELES. THERE ARE NO COMMON STANDARDS AND THERE ARE POLICING AND PUBLIC SAFETY INTERESTS WITHIN MANY CITIES THAT VALUE DRONES FOR THEIR OWN WORK??IN CRIME PREVENTION FIRE FIGHTING AND FOR MONITORING FOR EXAMPLE THE INTEGRITY OF LOCAL UTILITY SYSTEMS LIKE ELECTRICITY AND WATER. AS A RESULT THERE IS A TUMULT OF COMPETING INTERESTS AND VOICES BOTH WITHIN EACH COMMUNITY BECAUSE EACH COMMUNITY IS ITSELF A MICROCOSM OF ALL THE INTERESTS INVOLVED AND BETWEEN THE FAA AND EVERYBODY ELSE. STATE AND CITY OFFICIALS ARE NOT GOING TO GIVE UP EASILY ON THEIR OWN REGULATIONS. THEY TOO ARE CONFLICTED. ON THE ONE HAND THEY WANT TO BE TOUGHER THAN THE FAA IN PROHIBITING INVASIONS OF PRIVACY WHILE ON THE OTHER THEY ARE EAGER TO MAKE USE OF DRONES WHERE THEY HAVE PROVED THEIR UTILITY. AND THE DRONE INDUSTRY??S VESTED INTERESTS ARE CLEARLY GOING TO PRESS FOR A ROLLBACK OF SOME OF THE FAA??S PROPOSALS??LIKE THE ONE DECREEING THAT COMMERCIAL DRONES ??MAY NOT FLY OVER PEOPLE EXCEPT THOSE DIRECTLY INVOLVED WITH THE FLIGHT.? THAT??S A PRETTY RESTRICTIVE RULE DEPENDING ON HOW YOU DEFINE ??OVER? AND DISTINGUISH IT FROM ??NEAR.? THERE IS NO PROPOSED TEST TO ASSURE COMPETENCE IN FLYING SKILLS??LIKE UNDERSTANDING UP FROM DOWN THREE-DIMENSIONAL AWARENESS AND ACUITY AND HOPEFULLY WHAT DAMAGE MIGHT BE DONE BY A 50-POUND OBJECT IMPACTING A SOFT-SKINNED BEING AT 100MPH. AND ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IS BEING PROPOSED THAT WOULD ADDRESS THE GREATEST THREAT POSED BY DRONES??OF A COLLISION WITH A COMMERCIAL AIRLINER. IN 2014 THE FAA REPORTED THAT PILOTS REPORTED 238 SIGHTINGS OF DRONES DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO THEIR FLIGHT PATH BUT??AGAIN ACCORDING TO THE FAA??BY AUGUST OF 2015 THERE HAD ALREADY BEEN 650 SUCH INCIDENTS INCLUDING 138 WHERE DRONES WERE SEEN FLYING AS HIGH AS 10000 FEET AND SOME WHERE A DRONE CAME WITHIN 100 FEET OR LESS OF AIRPLANES ON APPROACH TO A RUNWAY. BE IN NO DOUBT A SMALL DRONE INGESTED INTO A JET ENGINE OR STRIKING A CONTROL SURFACE AT A CRITICAL MOMENT COULD BRING DOWN THE AIRPLANE. 2016 COULD BE THE YEAR WHEN WE SEE SUCH A TRAGEDY. THE FAA??S BASIC MISTAKE HAS BEEN TO ASSUME THAT IT CAN ACTUALLY REGULATE HUMAN BEHAVIOR IN THE SAME WAY THAT IT CAN REGULATE AN INDUSTRY. YOU COULD GIVE THE AGENCY ANOTHER 5000 REGULATORS IN THE BELIEF THAT THEY CAN POLICE THIS SITUATION BUT OF COURSE THEY NEVER COULD. A DRONE SELLING FOR A FEW HUNDRED BUCKS IS AN EXTRAORDINARILY SOPHISTICATED MACHINE THAT WILL OFTEN BE IN THE HANDS OF IDIOTS??OR WORSE. IN THE REAL WORLD THE SAME ASSHOLES THAT AIM LASERS AT INCOMING AIRLINERS OVER MAJOR CITIES WILL THINK NOTHING OF ??BUZZING? A JET CARRYING HUNDREDS OF PASSENGERS. THE REAL MEANS OF DEALING WITH THIS THREAT IS TO CHANGE WHAT YOU CAN CHANGE NOT WHAT YOU CAN??T. THAT MEANS CHANGING THE WAY THE MACHINE WORKS NOT THE WAY THE ??PILOT? BEHAVES. SOME MANUFACTURERS ALREADY OFFER SOFTWARE THAT AUTOMATICALLY IMPOSES ALTITUDE AND RANGE LIMITS??IN EFFECT PROSCRIBING A ??NO FLY ZONE? LIMIT ON THE MACHINE. TO THIS COULD BE ADDED A PROXIMITY SENSING ABILITY THAT WOULD PREVENT A DRONE FROM GETTING TOO CLOSE TO A BUILDING??OR AN AIRPLANE. BUT FOLLOWING THE LONG-STANDING TRADITION OF WAITING FOR SOMETHING BAD TO HAPPEN BEFORE ACTING TO PREVENT IT NEITHER THE FAA NOR THE DRONE INDUSTRY ARE READY TO TAKE THIS STEP. ,6302.0

FOR WOMEN SEX ISN??T JUST PHYSICAL??THE DETAILS MATTER. ??IT WAS SO CLINICAL AND UNAPPEALING. IT??S A MAN??S WORLD AND I FELT THAT NEEDED TO CHANGE? SAYS LEJEUNE. ??WHEN IT COMES TO SEX FOR WOMEN IT??S ALL-ENCOMPASSING. IT??S THE MENTAL STIMULATION THE SOFTNESS THE CONVERSATION AND THE PERFORMANCE THE SEDUCTIVENESS. IT??S THE KIND OF COCKTAIL YOU??VE BEEN DRINKING THE CHOCOLATES YOU??VE BEEN EATING IT??S THE WHOLE ENVIRONMENT.? APPROPRIATE WARDROBE IS EXPECTED SO DRESS TO IMPRESS. EACH PARTY OFFERS A UNIQUE THEME ENCOURAGING MEMBERS TO COME IN COSTUMED ATTIRE. GUESTS ARE GREETED WITH A GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE AND THE DRINKS FLOW FREELY ALL NIGHT. HOPING TO JOIN? NOT SO FAST. EXCLUSIVITY IS PART OF THE ALLURE. MEMBERS ARE HANDPICKED VETTED AND MUST BE REFERRED BY A CURRENT MEMBER. PARTIES ARE ARRANGED AT VARIOUS UNDISCLOSED LOCATIONS AND MEMBERS ARE GIVEN DIRECTIONS JUST A FEW DAYS PRIOR OR AT TIMES WITH JUST 24 HOURS NOTICE. TO CREATE TALKING POINTS AND SET THE MOOD EVERY SKIRT CLUB PARTY OFFERS SOME SORT OF SULTRY ENTERTAINMENT (THINK RAUNCHY BURLESQUE) AND A SEX-THEMED PRESENTATION BY A GUEST SPEAKER RANGING FROM APHRODISIACS TO SOFT BONDAGE OR BODY PSYCHOLOGY.

NOT ONLY DID THE SHOW SCORE A BEST COMEDY SERIES NOD BUT ITS STAR GAEL GARC??A BERNAL ALSO LANDED HIMSELF IN THE BEST ACTOR IN A TELEVISION COMEDY SERIES CATEGORY ALONGSIDE AZIZ ANSARI ROB LOWE AND JEFFREY TAMBOR. UNLIKE THOSE THREE MEN THE MEXICAN-BORN STAR OF FILMS Y TU MAM?­ TAMBI??N THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES AND MORE RECENTLY THE JON STEWART-DIRECTED DRAMA ROSEWATER IS NOT EXACTLY KNOWN FOR HIS COMEDY CHOPS. BUT FOR FANS OF MOZART WHICH JUST STARTED STREAMING ITS SECOND SEASON ON AMAZON DECEMBER 30 THE ACCOLADES WERE LESS SHOCKING. AS RODRIGO THE ECCENTRIC MAESTRO OF THE INCESTUOUS NEW YORK SYMPHONY HE HAS DEVELOPED A COMPLETELY UNIQUE PERFORMANCE AND CAN GET LAUGHS WITH NOTHING MORE THAN THE WAY HE MISPRONOUNCES THE NAME OF CO-STAR LOLA KIRKE??S CHARACTER. (IT??S HAILEY BUT COMING FROM RODRIGO IT SOUNDS MORE LIKE THE SPORT JAI ALAI.) ON MARCH 4 BERNAL RETURNS TO THE BIG SCREEN WITH YET ANOTHER DARK TURN IN THE IMMIGRATION THRILLER DESIERTO THE DIRECTORIAL DEBUT OF JON?­S CUAR??N WHO PREVIOUSLY CO-WROTE THE SCRIPT FOR GRAVITY WITH HIS FATHER ALFONSO CUAR??N. DESIERTO TURNS THE CONTENTIOUS IMMIGRATION DEBATE INTO A TENSE ACTION FILM SET ALONG THE U.S.-MEXICO BORDER. WHILE BERNAL PLAYS ONE OF A GROUP OF MIGRANTS TRYING TO ENTER THE UNITED STATES JEFFREY DEAN MORGAN PORTRAYS A RACIST VIGILANTE WHO DECIDES TO TAKE MATTERS INTO HIS OWN HANDS TO PREVENT THEM FROM DOING SO. BERNAL SPOKE TO THE DAILY BEAST ABOUT BOTH PROJECTS AND SHARED HIS MESSAGE FOR LATINOS WHO DON??T WANT TO SEE PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP BUILD A WALL ALONG THE SOUTHERN BORDER. BELOW IS AN EDITED AND CONDENSED VERSION OF OUR CONVERSATION. CONGRATS ON THE GOLDEN GLOBE NOMINATIONS FOR MOZART IN THE JUNGLE. THE SHOW SEEMS TO HAVE FLOWN UNDER THE RADAR FOR A WHILE BUT PEOPLE ARE FINALLY STARTING TO REALLY TAKE NOTICE JUST IN TIME FOR SEASON TWO. THANK YOU SO MUCH. YEAH THAT??S GREAT MAN. I??M REALLY HAPPY REALLY DELIGHTED. I??M JUST SPINNING. CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT DREW YOU TO THE PART OF RODRIGO? IT WAS A COMBINATION OF MANY THINGS BUT THE FACT THAT IT WAS A SHOW ABOUT CLASSICAL MUSIC REALLY PULLED MY ATTENTION. BECAUSE THAT ITSELF IS VERY ORIGINAL TO DO A TV SERIES ABOUT THAT. SO THAT PULLED ME IMMEDIATELY. BUT THE WAY IT WAS PUT TOGETHER THE PEOPLE THAT WERE INVOLVED??ROMAN [COPPOLA] JASON [SCHWARTZMAN] AND PAUL [WEITZ]??IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS VERY INTERESTING TO BE PART OF. AND NOW I??M JUST DELIGHTED BECAUSE I LOOK FORWARD EACH YEAR TO WORKING ON IT TO LEARN MORE BECAUSE I LEARN SO MUCH DOING EACH EPISODE. AND TO SPEND TIME IN NEW YORK WORKING WITH THIS WONDERFUL GROUP OF PEOPLE IT??S INCREDIBLE. AND TO PLAY RODRIGO HE??S ONE OF THE MOST FUN CHARACTERS TO PLAY YOU KNOW? HE??S SO FREE. HAVE YOU ENJOYED THE OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY COMEDY AFTER DOING A LOT OF DARKER WORK THROUGHOUT YOUR CAREER? I THINK YEAH THAT WAS SOMETHING I WAS LOOKING FOR AS WELL. BECAUSE IT WAS NICE TO DO SOMETHING RELAXED AND A LITTLE BIT MORE APPROACHABLE. AND AT THE SAME TIME IT TAKES ANOTHER TYPE OF EFFORT THAT LEAVES YOU REALLY TIRED. YOU HAVE TO BE REALLY CONNECTED AND REALLY PLAYING THE PART ALL OF THE TIME. COMEDY REQUIRES A LOT OF ENERGY. SHIFTING GEARS THE TRAILER FOR DESIERTO JUST PREMIERED. IT TELLS THE STORY OF A GROUP OF MIGRANTS TRYING TO CROSS THE U.S.-MEXICO BORDER BUT IT APPEARS TO BE A THRILLER OR EVEN A HORROR FILM. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR CHARACTER IN THE FILM? YEAH IT??S THIS MIGRANT STORY WITH EVERYONE CROSSING THE BORDER FOR DIFFERENT REASONS MOST OF THEM FORCED REASONS. AND THEY ENCOUNTER THIS CHARACTER WHO UNFORTUNATELY TAKES MATTERS INTO HIS OWN HANDS AND KIND OF VALIDATES A HATE DISCOURSE??JUST SUDDENLY SNAPS AND STARTS KILLING THESE PEOPLE. THE CHARACTER I PLAY IS ONE OF THESE MIGRANTS AND IT??S PURE ACTION THE FILM. SO A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL FIND A LOT OF COMPLEXITY IN ITS VERY STRONG ACTION SEQUENCES. AND HOPEFULLY A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL ENJOY THE FILM. WHY DO YOU THINK THIS STORY IS AN IMPORTANT ONE TO TELL? BECAUSE IT??S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE ALL OVER THE WORLD. AND IT??S AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE TALKED ABOUT BECAUSE THERE IS A HUGE VOID IN LEAVING A LARGE GROUP OF PEOPLE TO BE CONSIDERED CRIMINALS AND EVEN ??ILLEGAL? WHILE THE WORLD ECONOMY NEEDS THIS MIGRATION TO EXIST. MIGRATION IS AS NATURAL AS BREATHING AS EATING AS SLEEPING. IT IS PART OF LIFE PART OF NATURE. SO WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY OF ESTABLISHING A PROPER KIND OF SCENARIO FOR MODERN MIGRATION TO EXIST. AND WHEN I SAY ??WE? I MEAN THE WORLD. WE NEED TO FIND WAYS OF MAKING THAT MIGRATION NOT FORCED. BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY IN A LOT OF SITUATIONS RIGHT NOW WITH SYRIA FOR EXAMPLE A LOT OF THE MIGRATION THAT EXISTS IS A FORCED MIGRATION. BETWEEN ROSEWATER AND NOW DESIERTO MUCH OF YOUR WORK SEEMS AIMED AT MAKING A POLITICAL POINT. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE RECENT DEBATE OVER IMMIGRATION WHETHER IT IS IDEAS TO DEPORT MILLIONS OF UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS OR CALLS TO KEEP SYRIAN REFUGEES OUT OF THE COUNTRY? [SIGHS.] I THINK THAT??S THE WRONG WAY TO TACKLE THIS SUBJECT. BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL IT??S AN ISSUE THAT INVOLVES EVERYBODY. AND THERE ARE MANY LEGS TO IT. AND WITH IMMIGRATION AGAIN WE ARE DENYING A NATURAL PHENOMENON. WE CAN??T DENY THAT NATURAL PHENOMENON. WE NEED TO ESTABLISH ROOTS OF HOW TO MAKE THAT PHENOMENON HAPPEN IN A WAY THAT IS YES LEGAL BUT WE ALSO NEED TO PREVENT THIS FORCED MIGRATION FROM EXISTING. WHAT HAPPENED IN SYRIA IS TERRIBLE. WE ALL HAVE TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE LEFT WITHOUT A HOME AND WITHOUT A FUTURE. WE CAN??T LET THOSE KIDS NOT HAVE A FUTURE. AND IN THE CASE OF THE UNITED STATES AND MEXICO OR LATIN AMERICA THERE IS AN INTERDEPENDENT CULTURE AND ECONOMY. WE??VE SEEN THROUGH HISTORY THAT BUILDING WALLS IS COMPLETELY OBSOLETE AND COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS. THE BEST INVESTMENT YOU CAN MAKE IS TO PREVENT FORCED MIGRATION. AND TO TAKE DOWN WALLS SO WE SHARE THIS INTERDEPENDENCE IN HARMONY AND NOT IN THIS KIND OF CONTENTION. OF COURSE THE MAN WHO??S LEADING THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY RACE RIGHT NOW IS DONALD TRUMP WHO WANTS TO BUILD A WALL BETWEEN THE U.S. AND MEXICO. HOW DO YOU THINK LATINO VOTERS WILL RESPOND IF HE BECOMES THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT? WELL I WOULD SUSPECT THAT ANYONE WITH A HUMAN HEART WILL VOTE AGAINST PEOPLE WHO TALK THAT WAY. THERE ARE A FEW PEOPLE [IN THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE] WHO THINK LIKE THAT AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT IF WE DO A LITTLE BIT OF INSIGHT INTO HISTORY HOW MANY TIMES HAVE THERE BEEN PEOPLE DOING HATE DISCOURSE BLAMING EVERYTHING ON A CERTAIN GROUP OF PEOPLE? SO THAT REALLY IS THE GENESIS OF GENOCIDE WHERE IT KIND OF SPARKS. SO THIS HATRED SHOULD BE STOPPED AND THE BEST WAY TO STOP IT IS COMING OUT TO VOTE. ,17842.0

ATTACK,U.S. INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY AGENCIES ARE INVESTIGATING WHETHER RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT HACKERS WERE BEHIND A CYBER ATTACK ON THE UKRAINIAN POWER GRID LAST MONTH MULTIPLE SOURCES FAMILIAR WITH THE INVESTIGATION TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. COMPUTER SECURITY EXPERTS AT THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY THE NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY AND THE HOMELAND SECURITY DEPARTMENT ARE EXAMINING SAMPLES OF MALICIOUS SOFTWARE RECOVERED FROM THE NETWORKS OF A POWER COMPANY IN WESTERN UKRAINE WHICH SAID ON DECEMBER 23 THAT A LARGE AREA OF THE COUNTRY HAD BEEN LEFT WITHOUT ELECTRICITY DUE TO ??INTERFERENCE? IN ITS SYSTEMS. APPROXIMATELY 700000 HOMES WERE WITHOUT POWER FOR SEVERAL HOURS. IF THE BLACKOUT IS POSITIVELY ATTRIBUTED TO THE WORK OF HACKERS IT WILL BE THE FIRST DOCUMENTED CASE OF A CYBER ATTACK ON AN ELECTRICAL POWER FACILITY THAT LED TO A LOSS OF ELECTRICITY. WHILE HACKERS ARE SUSPECTED OF HAVING CAUSED A BLACKOUT AT LEAST ONCE IN THE PAST THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A PUBLICLY CONFIRMED CASE WITH TEHNICAL DATA TO BACK IT UP. ??IT IS A MILESTONE? JOHN HULTQUIST THE DIRECTOR OF CYBER ESPIONAGE ANALYSIS AT COMPUTER SECURITY COMPANY ISIGHT PARTNERS WHICH IS ANALYZING HACKING TOOLS USED IN THE INTRUSION TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. A CONFIRMED CYBER ATTACK THAT CAUSED A POWER OUTAGE WOULD PUT PRESSURE ON PRESIDENT OBAMA TO SPEAK PUBLICLY ABOUT THE EVENT AND SAY WHETHER RUSSIA WAS TO BLAME. IN 2014 OBAMA PUBLICLY IDENTIFIED NORTH KOREA AS THE CULPRIT IN A CYBER ATTACK ON SONY PICTURES ENTERTAINMENT THAT DESTROYED COMPANY PROPERTY AND EXPOSED PRIVATE COMMUNICATIONS OF EXECUTIVES. OBAMA ORDERED SANCTIONS ON NORTH KOREA AND U.S. GOVERNMENT HACKERS ATTACKED KEY PORTIONS OF NORTH KOREA??S FRAGILE INTERNET IN RESPONSE. SPOKESPERSONS FOR THE CIA AND THE HOMELAND SECURITY DEPARTMENT DECLINED TO COMMENT FOR THIS ARTICLE. A SPOKESPERSON FOR THE NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY DIDN??T RESPOND TO A REQUEST FOR COMMENT. THE UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT HAS PUBLICLY BLAMED RUSSIA FOR THE ATTACK. THE ATTACK IN UKRAINE COULD BE A BAD OMEN?Ÿ FOR THE U.S. POWER GRID. MALICIOUS SOFTWARE THAT WAS FOUND ON THE NETWORKS OF THE COMPANY PRYKARPATTYAOBLENERGO WAS ALSO USED IN A CAMPAIGN TARGETING POWER FACILITIES IN THE U.S. IN 2014. IT CAUSED NO DAMAGE BUT IT SET OFF ALARMS ACROSS THE SECURITY AND INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES. AT THE TIME THE HOMELAND SECURITY DEPARTMENT WARNED COMPANIES ABOUT THE MALWARE KNOWN AS BLACKENERGY WHICH IT SAID HAD BEEN USED IN A HACKING CAMPAIGN THAT ??COMPRISED NUMEROUS INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS ENVIRONMENTS??? INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS ARE USED TO REGULATE THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY AND TO REMOTELY CONTROL CRITICAL SYSTEMS AT POWER FACILITIES. SECURITY EXPERTS HAVE WARNED FOR YEARS THAT THEY COULD BE COMMANDEERED VIA THE INTERNET AND GIVE A HACKER THE ABILITY TO TURN OFF ELECTRICITY TO WHOLE CITIES. ??IF YOU??RE CONNECTED YOU??RE LIKELY INFECTED!? THE DEPARTMENT WARNED IN ANOTHER BULLETIN TO POWER COMPANIES IN THE SPRING OF 2015 URGING THEM TO DISCONNECT ANY CONTROL SYSTEMS THAT WERE STILL CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET IN LIGHT OF THE BLACKENERGY THREAT. ATTACKS THAT CAUSE LOSS OF ELECTRICAL POWER ON A LARGE-SCALE ARE ONE OF A HANDFUL OF NIGHTMARE SCENARIOS THAT U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO ENSURE DON??T COME TO PASS IN AMERICA. THEY FEAR THAT CITIES COULD GO WITHOUT POWER FOR MONTHS OR EVEN WEEKS IF EQUIPMENT THAT GENERATES OR DISTRIBUTES ELECTRICITY WERE TAKEN OFFLINE AND COULDN??T BE QUICKLY REPLACED.?Ÿ AMONG THE QUESTIONS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ANALYSTS WANT TO ANSWER IN THE UKRAINIAN CASE IS HOW EXACTLY THE HACKERS WERE ABLE TO PENETRATE THE COMPANY??S SYSTEMS AND WHETHER THEY WERE ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT IN MOSCOW OR WITH ITS IMPLIED CONSENT. THERE IS NO DOUBT MULTIPLE EXPERTS SAID THAT THE BLACKENERGY MALWARE THAT HAS BEEN LINKED TO INTRUSIONS INTO POWER FACILITIES IN THE U.S. WAS FOUND IN THE UKRAINIAN COMPANY??S SYSTEMS. BUT U.S. AND CORPORATE ANALYSTS ARE PROCEEDING CAUTIOUSLY GIVEN THE MOMENTOUSNESS OF THE EVENT AND THE GEOPOLITICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT??S INVOLVEMENT OR COMPLICITY IN AN HISTORIC ACT OF AGGRESSION. THEY??RE ALSO AWARE OF THE FACT THAT MOST POWER OUTAGES IN THE U.S. ULTIMATELY ATTRIBUTED TO NATURAL CAUSES SUCH AS STORMS AND OVERGROWN TREE LIMBS AND THAT FOR ALL THE HAND-WRINGING ABOUT CYBER ATTACKS ON THE GRID THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A PROVEN INSTANCE. AN OUTAGE IN BRAZIL THAT WAS ATTRIBUTED TO HACKERS WAS LATER SAID TO BE CAUSED BY DIRTY EQUIPMENT. EXPERTS IN GOVERNMENT AND AT AT LEAST THREE SECURITY COMPANIES ARE STILL COMPILING TECHNICAL DATA THAT WOULD SHOW CONCLUSIVELY THAT THE BLACKOUT WAS THE RESULT OF A MALICIOUS CYBER ATTACK AND NOT SOME OTHER FACTOR SUCH AS HUMAN ERROR OR A MECHANICAL FAILURE. BUT SOMETHING CLOSE TO A CONSENSUS VIEW THAT THE POWER OUTAGE WAS DELIBERATELY CAUSED WAS FORMING AMONG INDEPENDENT ANALYSTS ON TUESDAY. ISIGHT AS WELL SECURITY COMPANY ESET HAVE LINKED THE BLACKOUT TO HACKERS. AND THE SANS INSTITUTE A RESPECTED RESEARCH GROUP THAT TRAINS U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITY EXPERTS WHILE NOT CONCLUSIVELY IDENTIFYING THE CAUSE OF THE BLACKOUT SAID IN A BLOG POST LAST WEEK ??THE UKRAINIAN POWER OUTAGE IS MORE LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY A CYBER ATTACK THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT.? HULTQUIST OF ISIGHT?Ÿ SAID THE HACKERS WERE LIKELY PART OF A GROUP THAT THE COMPANY DUBBED SANDWORM AND THAT IT TRACKED IN 2014 DURING THE PROBES OF U.S. POWER FACILITIES THAT PROMPTED THE GOVERNMENT WARNING.?Ÿ ??I BELIEVE AT THE TIME THEY WERE PREPARING FOR AN ESCALATING EVENT WITH U.S. AND EUROPE? HULTQUIST SAID. IT??S STILL NOT CLEAR WHY THE HACKERS DIDN??T FOLLOW THROUGH AND CAUSE A POWER OUTAGE BUT HULTQUIST DESCRIBED THEIR PROBES AS A ??RECONNAISSANCE? MISSION THAT WOULD GIVE THEM THE LAY OF THE LAND SHOULD THEY HAVE CHOSEN TO LAUNCH AN ASSAULT. RUSSIAN HACKERS HAVE BEEN BLAMED FOR CYBER ATTACKS IN THE PAST INCLUDING AGAINST PENTAGON NETWORKS LAST YEAR IN AN APPARENT ATTEMPT TO STEAL MILITARY SECRETS. GIVEN THAT RUSSIA HAS DEMONSTRATED BOTH THE WILL AND THE EXPERTISE TO USE CYBER ATTACKS U.S. OFFICIALS ARE PAYING ESPECIALLY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE EVENT IN UKRAINE. ??I'M CONFIDENT THEY AND THE UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT HAVE A LOT OF DATA AND A LOT OF TECHNICAL EVIDENCE THAT??S NOT YET PUBLIC? ROBERT M. LEE THE FOUNDER AND CEO OF DRAGOS SECURITY WHO HAS WORKED IN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY AND THE MILITARY AS A CYBER WARFARE OPERATIONS OFFICER TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS DECLINED TO COMMENT FOR THIS ARTICLE. BUT OBAMA HAS STRESSED FOR YEARS THAT U.S. ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS ARE VULNERABLE TO CYBER ATTACK. IN MAY 2009 IN HIS FIRST MAJOR ADDRESS ABOUT CYBER SECURITY AFTER TAKING OFFICE OBAMA SAID ??WE KNOW THAT CYBER INTRUDERS HAVE PROBED OUR ELECTRICAL GRID AND THAT IN OTHER COUNTRIES CYBER ATTACKS HAVE PLUNGED ENTIRE CITIES INTO DARKNESS.? HE DID NOT NAME THOSE COUNTRIES. IN 2008 TOM DONOHUE THEN THE CIA??S CHIEF CYBER-SECURITY OFFICER SAID THAT HACKERS HAD BREACHED COMPUTER SYSTEMS OF UTILITY COMPANIES OUTSIDE THE U.S. AND HAD DEMANDED RANSOM OR ELSE THEY??D SHUT DOWN THE POWER. DONOHUE WHO SPOKE AT A GATHERING IN NEW ORLEANS OF SECURITY EXECUTIVES FROM GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND LARGE U.S. UTILITIES AND ENERGY COMPANIES SAID THAT IN AT LEAST ONE CASE AN INTRUSION HAD CAUSED A POWER OUTAGE THAT AFFECTED MULTIPLE CITIES. THE CIA DIDN??T KNOW WHO WAS BEHIND THE ATTACKS ??BUT ALL INVOLVED INTRUSIONS THROUGH THE INTERNET? DONOHUE SAID. ,11332.0
784,10032608.0,2016-01-18T05:03:00+00:00,FLINT WAS FORGOTTEN BEFORE IT WAS POISONED,LONG BEFORE FLINT BEGAN DEALING WITH A TOXIC WATER CRISIS THE CITY WAS ALREADY RUSTING AND OOZING FROM ITS UNDERBELLY. WHAT LITTLE HOPE REMAINS IS WEARY AND TORN ABANDONED LIKE THE ROWS OF DILAPIDATED UNINHABITABLE HOMES AND WEED STREWN LOTS THAT DOT THE AVENUES DROWNING IN WATER TOO TOXIC TO DRINK. THE STORY OF FLINT MICHIGAN NOT UNLIKE OTHER FORMER SMOKE STACK CITIES THAT DOT THE UPPER MIDWEST IS ALMOST TOO PAINFUL TO TELL. THE LATEST REVELATIONS INVOLVING A WATER SUPPLY TAINTED WITH LEAD FEELS LIKE A CRUEL JOKE BEING PLAYED ON PEOPLE WHO CAN LEAST AFFORD THE LAUGH. WITH THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN AT RISK THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS ANNOUNCED AN INVESTIGATION INTO WHO KNEW THE WATER WAS TOXIC AND WHEN MICHIGAN??S ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS LAUNCHED A SEPARATE INQUIRY. ULTIMATELY WHAT HAPPENED IN FLINT MAY NOT BE A CRIMINAL MATTER BUT THERE IS NOTHING MORAL ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED THERE. THE ONCE-BOOMING CENTER OF INDUSTRY HAS LOST HALF OF ITS POPULATION IN RECENT DECADES AND IS NOW ONE OF THE POOREST CITIES IN THE NATION. TODAY NEARLY 40 PERCENT OF FLINT RESIDENTS LIVE BELOW THE POVERTY LINE. WHAT REMAINS OF FLINT IS 56 PERCENT BLACK AND NEARLY 40 PERCENT WHITE??ALL TOO POOR TO GET UP AND LEAVE. BLINK AND YOU COULD BE STANDING IN GARY INDIANA EAST ST. LOUIS ILLINOIS OR CAMDEN NEW JERSEY WATCHING A SIMILAR TRAGEDY UNFOLD. FACTORIES CLOSE THE MIDDLE CLASS TAKES FLIGHT TO THE SUBURBS TO BUILD BETTER SCHOOLS AND TEND TO PRISTINE LAWNS. THEY ARE AMONG AMERICA??S FORGOTTEN CITIES??WRACKED WITH PERVASIVE POVERTY AND VIOLENT CRIME??POPULATED BY A FORGOTTEN PEOPLE. MOSTLY BLACK AND BROWN THEY HAVE LITTLE VOICE OVER THEIR OWN DESTINY. THERE ARE NO FINELY SUITED WASHINGTON LOBBYISTS PRESSING THEIR INTERESTS. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES RARELY COME TO PLACES LIKE THESE AND THEY ALMOST NEVER MAKE THE NATIONAL NEWS UNLESS SOMETHING REALLY BAD HAPPENS. THERE ARE SO MANY PROBLEMS SO MANY COMPLICATIONS IN FLINT THAT IT IS DIFFICULT FOR ANY ONE ISSUE TO COMMAND ITS COLLECTIVE ATTENTION. BACK IN APRIL 2014 AN UNELECTED MANAGER APPOINTED BY THE STATE TO MAKE FLINT SOLVENT DECIDED THE CITY COULD SAVE MONEY BY DRAWING WATER FROM THE FLINT RIVER INSTEAD OF LAKE HURON. LOCAL RESIDENTS THOUGHT IT WAS A JOKE GIVEN THE UGLINESS THOUGHT TO BE SWIMMING IN THAT RIVER. IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN A FIVE-MINUTE TEST TO PROVE THE RIVER WATER UNSAFE. CITY LEADERS WHO WERE THEN WEIGHING LESS EXPENSIVE OPTIONS KNEW AS EARLY AS 2011 THAT WATER FROM THE FLINT RIVER WOULD NEED TREATMENT WITH AN ANTICORROSIVE AGENT BEFORE IT WOULD BE DRINKABLE. IN THE END THE GOVERNOR SAYS HE HAD NO CHOICE SINCE DETROIT ??KICKED FLINT OFF? ITS LAKE HURON SYSTEM. THE FACT IS THAT NEVER HAPPENED. DETROIT ASKED FOR A RATE CHANGE AND INSTEAD OF NEGOTIATING GOV. RICK SNYDER??S APPOINTEE OPTED OUT. THEY WERE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT SAVING MONEY THAN SAVING LIVES. TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE THE MICHIGAN STATE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY DECIDED $100 A DAY WAS TOO MUCH TO PAY FOR AN ANTICORROSIVE ADDITIVE THAT COULD APPROPRIATELY TREAT THE WATER. CONSEQUENTLY THE IRON PIPES ERODED?? TURNING THE WATER BROWN??AND LEAD BEGAN SEEPING INTO THE WATER SUPPLY. STATE AND FEDERAL OFFICIALS KNEW THERE WAS A PROBLEM. WITH BROWN WATER PUMPING OUT OF KITCHEN FAUCETS AND FIRE HYDRANTS THERE WAS NO WAY TO HIDE THEIR ERROR. STATE AGENCIES REPORTEDLY USED TESTING METHODOLOGIES THAT WOULD HIDE THE REAL LEVEL OF POLLUTANTS??INCLUDING FLUSHING RESIDENTIAL SYSTEMS BEFORE TESTING. THEY CHEATED TO MAKE IT APPEAR THAT THE WATER WAS IN COMPLIANCE KNOWING THAT SKEWED TESTS WERE USED. ULTIMATELY IT TOOK 18 MONTHS AND A MOTHER NAMED LEANNE WALTERS WHO WOULDN??T GIVE UP CHICAGO-BASED EPA REGULATIONS MANAGER A LOCAL PHYSICIAN AN INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST AND A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT TO FORCE THE STATE TO DO THE RIGHT THING. BY THEN THE DAMAGE WAS DONE??TO WALTER??S FOUR-YEAR-OLD TWINS AND THE AT LEAST FIVE PERCENT OF FLINT CHILDREN WHO HAVE TESTED POSITIVE. THE EFFECTS OF LEAD POISONING ESPECIALLY ON CHILDREN ARE WELL KNOWN AND THERE ARE NO SAFE LEVELS FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. LEAD POISONING CAN HAVE DEVASTATING EFFECTS ON CHILDREN CAUSING CONVULSIONS HYPER IRRITABILITY AND NEUROLOGICAL DAMAGE THAT LASTS INTO ADULTHOOD. STUDIES SHOW LINKAGES TO JUVENILE DELINQUENCY ADHD AND A DECREMENT IN IQ PERFORMANCE. IN FACT THERE IS SO MUCH LEAD IN THE BLOOD OF FLINT??S CHILDREN THAT THE STATE HAS CALLED A STATE OF EMERGENCY. THE SCOURGE IS IRREVERSIBLE. THIS IS A MANMADE DISASTER THAT WILL HAVE CATASTROPHIC GENERATIONAL EFFECTS. THE FLINT WATER CRISIS IS JUST THE LATEST AMONG A WHOLE HOST OF SERIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES SURROUNDING THE CITY. WHEN GENERAL MOTORS AND SUPPLIERS PULLED UP STAKES AND LEFT FOR GREENER PASTURES THEY LEFT UNCONSCIONABLE LEVELS OF CONTAMINATION BEHIND. THE SAME IS TRUE IN OTHER RUST BELT CITIES. A COMMUNITY??S WEALTH IS NOT ONLY TIED TO JOBS AND EDUCATION BUT ALSO TO HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT. ECONOMIC RECOVERY FOR FLINT AND OTHERS TOWNS LIKE IT IS ABOUT MORE THAN MOVING IN A NEW COMPANY WITH SOME NEW JOBS. IT??S ABOUT REBUILDING FAILING INFRASTRUCTURES AND REMAKING SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS. WE CAN KEEP THUMPING OUR CHEST ABOUT PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP BUT HERE WILL BE NO ECONOMIC UPLIFT IN FLINT CAMDEN GARY OR EAST ST. LOUIS UNTIL GOVERNMENT DOES ITS PART. THAT MEANS FORCING CHEMICAL MANUFACTURERS AUTOMAKERS STEEL MILLS AND OTHERS TO CLEAN UP THEIR OWN MESS. THEY SHOULD BE FORCED TO FILL THE HOLE THEY DUG. IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT NO ONE KNEW WHAT WAS IN THAT RIVER. IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT NO ONE THOUGHT TO TEST THE WATER AND THE SYSTEM THROUGH WHICH IT WOULD TRAVEL FOR POTENTIAL PROBLEMS. AND THE GOVERNOR?? EXPLANATION ABOUT WHY THE CHANGE WAS MADE AS WELL AS HIS RELIANCE ON HIS HAND PICKED INVESTIGATIVE TASK FORCE IS EVEN MORE DUBIOUS. STATE LEADERS IT SEEMS WERE CONTENT TO CONTINUE TIGHTEN THE CITY??S BELT UNTIL SOMEBODY STRANGLED AND DIED. ,20223.0

GUEDE DESCRIBED IN BLUSHING DETAIL HOW HE HAD MET KERCHER A FEW MONTHS BEFORE HER MURDER AND HOW ON HALLOWEEN THE TWO SHARED A KISS ON THE DANCE FLOOR OF A LOCAL NIGHTCLUB SAYING IT ??ISN??T THAT DIFFICULT TO GET A KISS ON THE DANCE FLOOR IN A COLLEGE SCENE.? HE BRUSHED OFF REPORTS THAT KERCHER??S FRIENDS DENIED SUCH A KISS WITH WHAT AMOUNTED TO A WINK AND A NOD AND TALKED ABOUT HOW DARK A NIGHTCLUB REALLY IS. HE STOOD BY HIS ORIGINAL STORY THAT AFTER THAT DANCE-FLOOR KISS KERCHER HAD INVITED HIM OVER THE NEXT NIGHT NOV. 1 2007 AND HE HAPPILY OBLIGED ARRIVING AT HER HOUSE AFTER DARK. HE SAID SHE OPENED THE DOOR FOR HIM AND THAT THEY SAT IN HER LIVING ROOM HE DRANK A JUICE AND THEN THEY ENGAGED IN ??PETTING? BUT STOPPED SHORT OF SEX BECAUSE NEITHER OF THEM HAD A CONDOM. AND HE ADDED BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN IN OTHER RELATIONSHIPS HE WOULDN??T GO FURTHER UNPROTECTED. WHEN FRANCA LEOSINI THE SHOW??S INTERVIEWER PRESSED HIM ABOUT WHY IF HE HAD GONE THERE TO CONTINUE THE ROMANCE FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE HE HADN??T TAKEN A PROPHYLACTIC ??JUST IN CASE? HE SHRUGGED IT OFF. GUEDE THEN DESCRIBED HOW KERCHER COMPLAINED TO HIM ABOUT HER ROOMMATE KNOX SAYING SHE HAD STOLEN HER MONEY AND HOW SHE WAS A SLOB. THEN FEELING THE EFFECTS OF A SPICY KEBAB HE HAD EATEN EARLIER HE HAD EXCUSED HIMSELF TO ONE OF THE BATHROOMS IN THE APARTMENT WHERE HE SPENT ??AROUND 10 OR 11 MINUTES? AND LISTENED TO TWO AND A HALF SONGS BEFORE A SCREAM ??LOUDER THAN THE MUSIC FROM MY HEADPHONES? STARTLED HIM. THAT SCREAM HE SAID CAME AFTER KNOX WHOSE VOICE HE RECOGNIZED??SOMEHOW DESPITE HIS LOUD MUSIC??HAD COME HOME TO CONFRONT HER ROOMMATE. THEN HE SAID HE HURRIED TO FINISH HIS BUSINESS AND RAN OUT OF THE BATHROOM LEAVING THE TOILET FAMOUSLY UN-FLUSHED AS HE RACED OUT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED. THERE HE SAW A MAN HE SAID. A RANDOM MAN IT WOULD SEEM AT THAT. SOMEONE HE DIDN??T KNOW. SOMEONE FOREIGN TO HIM. SOMEONE WHO AFTER ALL THESE YEARS HE HAS COME TO KNOW AS PART OF HIS OWN THEORY BUT WHO REMAINED NAMELESS. HE THEN QUOTED THE COURT DOCUMENTS THAT NAMED THAT MAN AS RAFFAELE SOLLECITO THOUGH HE REFUSED TO DO SO HIMSELF. SOLLECITO IT MIGHT BE NOTED HAD SPENT THE WEEK PRIOR TO THE AIRING OF THE HIGHLY ANTICIPATED INTERVIEW THREATENING TO SUE GUEDE IF HE WAS NAMED IN AN ATTEMPT TO STOP THE SHOW FROM BEING BROADCAST. AS IT TURNS OUT SOLLECITO NEEDN??T HAVE WORRIED SINCE GUEDE DIDN??T NAME HIM. BUT KNOX GUEDE SAID MORE THAN ONCE WAS THERE. ??I AM 101 PERCENT CERTAIN AMANDA KNOX WAS THERE? HE SAID BEFORE DESCRIBING HOW THE UNNAMED MAN WARNED KNOX THAT THEY HAD ??BEEN DISCOVERED? AND RAN OUT OF THE BUILDING BUT NOT BEFORE SAYING ??BLACK MAN FOUND GUILTY FOUND.? GUEDE SAID HE KNEW KNOX FROM FLIRTING WITH HER AT THE BAR WHERE SHE WORKED AND HE DESCRIBED IN DETAIL HOW THEY FOUND A CONNECTION WHEN HE TOLD HER HE ALSO HAD A FRIEND FROM SEATTLE. THEN GUEDE SAID TWO THINGS THAT EVEN THE MOST SEASONED KERCHER MURDER WATCHERS MAY HAVE FOUND SURPRISING. HE ADMITTED TO GOING INTO KERCHER??S ROOM AFTER KNOX AND THE UNNAMED MAN LEFT WITH FLUFFY TOWELS TO TRY TO STOP THE FLOW OF BLOOD FROM THE STAB WOUNDS TO KERCHER??S NECK. THEN HE SAID HE FLED THE SCENE OUT OF A COMBINATION OF FEAR AND PARANOIA THAT HE CONVENIENTLY REGRETS. HE WENT TO GERMANY HE SAID BUT ONLY BECAUSE THAT WAS WHERE THE NEXT TRAIN WAS GOING ADDING THAT HE MIGHT HAVE JUST AS EASILY ENDED UP IN RUSSIA. THEN HE TOLD LEOSINI THAT WHEN HE FLED KERCHER WAS COMPLETELY CLOTHED IN ??THE SAME CLOTHES SHE WAS WEARING WHEN SHE OPENED THE DOOR FOR ME.? BUT THE FACTS BEG AN EXPLANATION SINCE KERCHER WAS FOUND SEMI-NUDE WITH HER JEANS AND UNDERWEAR IN A HEAP ON THE FLOOR. HER BRA??WHICH WAS COVERED WITH BLOOD SPLATTERS IMPLYING SHE WAS WEARING IT WHEN SHE WAS STABBED??HAD BEEN CUT FROM HER BODY AND LAY IN SHREDS ON THE FLOOR. SOLLECITO??S DNA WAS ORIGINALLY FOUND ON THE TINY METAL HOOK OF THE CLASP OF THAT BRA BUT THAT EVIDENCE WAS LARGELY DISCOUNTED BECAUSE THE CUT CLASP HAD BEEN COLLECTED SOME SIX WEEKS AFTER THE MURDER TOOK PLACE. ??SHE WAS DRESSED WHEN I LEFT? GUEDE SAID UNDOUBTEDLY KNOWING VERY WELL THE ACCUSATION SUCH A STATEMENT WOULD IMPLY. GUEDE ALSO SAID THAT WHEN HE RAN OUT OF THE HOUSE HE LEFT KERCHER??S BEDROOM DOOR OPEN WHICH OF COURSE IS NOT HOW IT WAS FOUND. THE MORNING AFTER THE MURDER KNOX AND SOLLECITO WERE ALONE IN THE HOUSE AND SAY KERCHER??S DOOR WAS LOCKED FROM THE INSIDE AND HAD TO BE BROKEN DOWN. ONE OF THE FEW PLACES WHERE GUEDE??S DNA AND FINGERPRINTS WERE NOT PRESENT IN THE MURDER ROOM WAS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE DOOR WHICH WAS ABSENT OF ANY USABLE FORENSIC EVIDENCE EXCEPT THE FINGERPRINTS OF SOLLECITO WHO SAID HE TRIED IN VAIN TO OPEN THE DOOR. CURIOUS INDEED. GUEDE AND HIS INTERVIEWER SAID NO MONEY WAS EXCHANGED FOR HIS EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW AND INDEED IT WILL HAVE NO IMPACT WHATSOEVER ON THE CASE WHICH IS NOW OFFICIALLY CLOSED AFTER KNOX AND SOLLECITO??S CASE WAS THROWN OUT BY ITALY??S HIGH COURT IN 2015. GUEDE WHO WAS CONVICTED DEFINITIVELY AS ONE OF THREE ASSASSINS CHOSE NOT TO PURSUE A RETRIAL AFTER HIS PRESUMED CO-CONSPIRATORS WERE LET GO AS IT COULD HAVE RESULTED IN A NEW CONVICTION AND A LONGER SENTENCE. BUT NO MATTER SINCE GUEDE WILL BE FREE SOON AS WELL. HE HAS BEEN ELIGIBLE FOR WORK RELEASE FOR ALMOST TWO YEARS BUT HAS CHOSEN TO WORK ON HIS STUDIES IN PRISON INSTEAD. CONSIDERING HE HAD NO PRIOR CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS BEFORE HIS MURDER CONVICTION AND HIS APPARENT GOOD BEHAVIOR IN PRISON HE WILL MOST CERTAINLY BE ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE BY 2018. THE FORGOTTEN PROTAGONIST IN THE STORY AS LEONISI SO POIGNANTLY POINTED OUT IN HER INTERVIEW WITH GUEDE IS KERCHER WHO WOULD HAVE TURNED 30 ON DEC. 28 AND WHOSE VERSION OF THE STORY WHICH WOULD CLEARLY BE THE DEFINITIVE ONE HAS SADLY GONE WITH HER TO HER GRAVE. ,279494.0

445,9809461.0,2016-01-11T05:01:00+00:00,WHEN THE SUPREME COURT BUSTS A UNION,SCOTT WALKER MAY BE YESTERDAY??S NEWS BUT HIS BRAND OF UNION-BUSTING REPUBLICANISM IS ABOUT TO HAVE ITS DAY IN COURT??SUPREME COURT. AND IT WILL PROBABLY WIN. THE COURT WILL HEAR ORAL ARGUMENTS IN THE CASE OF FRIEDRICHS V. CALIFORNIA TEACHER ASSOCIATION WHICH ADDRESSES AN OBSCURE BUT ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF PUBLIC EMPLOYEE UNIONS: WHETHER NON-UNION MEMBERS CAN BE REQUIRED AS A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT TO PAY FEES TO THE UNION FOR NEGOTIATING THEIR CONTRACTS. ON THE FACE OF IT IT SEEMS ABSURD THAT NON-MEMBERS SHOULD HAVE TO PAY UNION FEES. BUT IT ISN??T REALLY. WHILE NON-UNION-MEMBERS LOSE SOME OF THE BENEFITS OF UNION MEMBERSHIP IN EXCHANGE FOR NOT PAYING DUES THEY STILL ENJOY THE CENTRAL ONE: HAVING THE UNION DO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING FOR THEM. SO EVEN IF THEY CHOOSE NOT TO PAY DUES AND NOT TO JOIN THEY ARE STILL REQUIRED TO PAY A FEE TO COVER THOSE COSTS. IF NON-MEMBERS DIDN??T PAY THE FEE THEY WOULD BE WHAT ECONOMISTS CALL ??FREE RIDERS???PEOPLE WHO GET ALL THE BENEFIT BUT PAY NONE OF THE COST. WHAT WOULD BE THE POINT OF JOINING THE UNION IF YOU GET ITS CENTRAL BENEFIT FOR FREE? BY WAY OF COMPARISON SUPPOSE I DON??T LIKE U.S. POLICY SO I WANT TO OPT OUT OF PAYING TAXES. THAT??S NOT FAIR BECAUSE I STILL BENEFIT FROM THE COUNTRY??S MILITARY INFRASTRUCTURE AND SO ON. I??M A ??FREE RIDER.? SO WHILE THERE ARE MANY THINGS I CAN LEGALLY DO TO PROTEST THOSE POLICIES REFUSING TO PAY TAXES IS NOT ONE OF THEM. LIKEWISE IN THE CASE OF UNIONS WHICH IS WHY UNION FEE PROVISIONS ARE OFTEN KNOWN INFORMALLY AS ??FAIR SHARE PROVISIONS.? SUCH FEES EVEN IF THEY WERE EQUAL IN SIZE TO UNION DUES THEMSELVES WERE HELD TO BE CONSTITUTIONAL IN THE CASE OF ABOOD V. DETROIT BOARD OF EDUCATION IN 1977. THAT ALL MAKES ECONOMIC SENSE BUT THIS IS POLITICS AND PUBLIC UNIONS ARE A HOT POLITICAL ISSUE. IN 2011 WISCONSIN GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER DEFINED HIS NATIONAL REPUTATION BY STRIPPING PUBLIC-EMPLOYEE UNIONS OF THEIR RIGHTS TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND MANDATORY PAYMENT OF DUES ?? EFFECTIVELY KILLING THE UNIONS ENTIRELY. (HE ALSO MADE WISCONSIN THE 25TH ??RIGHT TO WORK? STATE CRIPPLING PRIVATE-SECTOR UNIONS AS WELL.) AND IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WALKER WENT EVEN FURTHER PROPOSING TO ABOLISH FEDERAL WORKERS?? UNIONS OUTRIGHT. AND IT??S NOT JUST SCOTT WALKER. IN ADDITION TO REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ALL OF WHO SEEK TO CURB THE POWER OF UNIONS THE KOCH-FUNDED AMERICAN LEGISLATIVE EXCHANGE COUNCIL OR ALEC HAS ADVANCED LEGISLATION FOR RESTRICTING COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROHIBITING DUES DEDUCTIONS FROM PAYCHECKS ?? AND OPTING OUT OF THE KIND OF DUES-PAYING REQUIREMENTS NOW AT ISSUE IN FRIEDRICHS. IN FACT FRIEDRICHS WOULD MAKE THE KOCHS?? WORK UNNECESSARY SINCE IT WOULD BAN MANDATORY DUES AND MANDATORY FEES NATIONWIDE. WHEN THE COURT LAST TOOK UP THIS ISSUE TWO YEARS AGO IT RULED AGAINST THE UNIONS THOUGH IN A CASE WHERE CONTEXT LIMITED THE REACH OF THE OPINION. THE 5-4 OPINION IN THAT CASE HARRIS V. QUINN HELD THAT PUBLIC HEALTH WORKERS WHO WERE CONTRACTED BY THE STATE OF ILLINOIS COULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO PAY UNION FEES. THIS THE COURT SAID WAS ACTUALLY AN ??EXPANSION? OF ABOOD AND STRUCK IT DOWN FOR THAT REASON. BUT THE COURT ALSO CAST DOUBT ON ABOOD ITSELF ?? WHICH IS WHY TWO YEARS LATER IT LOOKS LIKE THE PRECEDENT MAY BE OVERTURNED AND PUBLIC-SECTOR UNIONS BUSTED NATIONWIDE. AFTER A LENGTHY HISTORY OF THE CASES LEADING UP TO ABOOD JUSTICE ALITO WRITING FOR THE COURT CALLED THAT CASE ??QUESTIONABLE ON SEVERAL GROUNDS? AND ??TROUBLING? AND SPENT SEVERAL PAGES TEARING APART ITS CORE REASONING. ULTIMATELY ABOOD WAS LEFT STANDING AND SO THESE STATEMENTS ARE NOT QUITE SETTLED LAW (JUSTICE KAGAN??S DISSENT CALLED THEM ??POTSHOTS?) BUT THEY CERTAINLY SUGGEST THAT THE CLOCK IS TICKING. THE REASON IS THE FIRST AMENDMENT. IN ABOOD THE TEACHERS WHO WANTED TO OPT OUT OF THE TEACHER??S UNION SAID THAT THEIR DUES WERE PROMOTING THE UNION??S POLITICAL SPEECH INCLUDED ON THE ISSUE OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING ITSELF. FACTUALLY SPEAKING THIS IS CERTAINLY TRUE. UNIONS TAKE POLITICAL POSITIONS ALL THE TIME AND MANDATORY UNION DUES OR ??FEES? ARE SUPPORTING THEM. THUS IN ABOOD THE COURT TRIED TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN ??CHARGEABLE? EXPENSES (I.E. THOSE CONNECTED WITH CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS) AND ??NONCHARGEABLE? (I.E. POLITICAL ONES). BUT AS JUSTICE ALITO NOTED IN HARRIS V. QUINN THAT DISTINCTION HAS PROVEN VERY HARD TO MAINTAIN. WHAT EXPENSES ARE REALLY ??GERMANE? TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING? WHOSE SALARIES COUNT? MUST COURTS AUDIT THE UNIONS?? BUDGETS TO ENSURE NO CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATION IS TAKING PLACE? IT??S EASY TO ARGUE BOTH SIDES OF THESE QUESTIONS BUT THAT MAY NOT MATTER BECAUSE OF THE MAKEUP OF THE COURT. ARGUABLY EVEN SOME LEACHING OF UNION DUES INTO POLITICAL SPEECH MAY BE JUSTIFIED BY THE PUBLIC POLICY REASONS FOR HAVING PUBLIC-SECTOR UNIONS. ARGUABLY THE STATE MAY RESTRICT (OR COMPEL) SPEECH MORE WHEN IT IS AN EMPLOYER THAN WHEN IT IS A GOVERNMENT. BUT ULTIMATELY WITH FIVE JUSTICES HAVING ALREADY SIGNED ONTO A CONDEMNATION OF ABOOD THE UNIONS?? DAYS SEEM NUMBERED. THE BEST/LAST ARGUMENT AVAILABLE TO THE UNIONS IS STARE DECISIS THE PRECEDENTIAL VALUE OF SUPREME COURT OPINIONS. STARE DECISIS (LITERALLY ??THE DECISION STANDS?) IS A POWERFUL DOCTRINE IT RAISES THE BAR FOR OVERTURNING PRECEDENTS AND IT SAVED ROE V. WADE AT A TIME WHEN MANY THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT TO BE OVERTURNED. AND HERE EVEN IF ABOOD IS DEEMED TO BE ??QUESTIONABLE? STARE DECISIS MIGHT SAVE THAT HOLDING TOO. NO DOUBT THAT??S WHY JUSTICE KAGAN??S DISSENT TWO YEARS AGO SPENT FIVE LONG PARAGRAPHS APPLYING STARE DECISIS TO ABOOD. IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THAT JUSTICE KENNEDY OR CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS WOULD OFFER A RINGING ENDORSEMENT OF PUBLIC-SECTOR UNIONS BUT AS JUDICIAL CONSERVATIVES ONE OF THEM MIGHT SIGN ON TO STARE DECISIS. IT??S EASY TO BE CYNICAL ABOUT THESE CASES. IS IT THE LEAST BIT SUSPICIOUS THAT THE COURT??S FIVE CONSERVATIVES OPPOSE UNIONS WHILE THE COURT??S FOUR LIBERALS SUPPORT THEM? IS IT JUST A COINCIDENCE THAT THE CONSERVATIVE MEMBERS WERE APPOINTED BY REPUBLICANS WHO ARE NOW ENGAGED IN A NATIONWIDE CAMPAIGN OF UNION-BUSTING WHILE THE LIBERALS WERE APPOINTED BY DEMOCRATS WHOSE BASE INCLUDES THE UNIONS? AND IT??S IN THE POLITICAL REALM FAR MORE THAN THE CONSTITUTIONAL ONE THAT FRIEDRICHS WILL BE RELEVANT. IN CONSTITUTIONAL TERMS THIS IS YET ANOTHER CASE BALANCING FREE-SPEECH RIGHTS WITH GOVERNMENT POLICY. IT??S FULL OF THREE-PRONGED TESTS AND OBSCURE LEGAL STANDARDS. BUT IN POLITICAL TERMS IF THE UNIONS LOSE IN THIS CASE THEY WILL BE CRIPPLED AROUND THE COUNTRY AS THEIR FINANCIAL STABILITY WILL BE THREATENED. THE ENTIRE DYNAMIC OF PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYMENT WILL CHANGE DRAMATICALLY LIKELY RESULTING IN LOWER WAGES AND FEWER BENEFITS. IT WILL BE A HUGE WIN FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY BROUGHT ABOUT BY FIVE REPUBLICANS IN WASHINGTON AND KOCH-FUNDED ACTIVISTS WHO BROUGHT THIS LITIGATION IN THE FIRST PLACE. BUT THERE IS ONE FINAL IRONY. AS WORKERS ARE WEAKENED EMPLOYERS ARE STRENGTHENED. THUS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WHICH THEORETICALLY OPPOSES THE POWER OF GOVERNMENT WILL IN FACT HAVE GREATLY INCREASED IT. ,7768.0
715,9992575.0,2016-01-16T05:05:00+00:00,CODDLED INFANTS CLAIM COLLEGE VICTORY,PERPETUALLY OFFENDED STUDENTS HAVE NOTCHED ANOTHER WIN??THIS TIME AT ITHACA COLLEGE IN NEW YORK WHERE PRESIDENT TOM ROCHON WAS FORCED INTO EARLY RETIREMENT DUE TO HIS PERCEIVED MISHANDLING OF RACIAL SLIGHTS. ONCE AGAIN THE AGGRIEVED MOBS ON CAMPUSES HAVE FLEXED THEIR MUSCLE PROVING HOW DANGEROUS IT IS TO DISAGREE WITH THEM. ROCHON??S OUSTER CLOSELY RESEMBLES THE RESIGNATIONS OF PRESIDENT TIM WOLFE AND CHANCELLOR R. BOWEN LOFTIN AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI SEVERAL WEEKS AGO. LIKE WOLFE AND BOWEN ROCHON WAS ACCUSED OF FAILING TO PREVENT INSTANCES OF RACIAL HARASSMENT THAT NO ADMINISTRATOR COULD HAVE FORESTALLED. INDEED ROCHON??S ALLEGED SHORTCOMINGS SEEM EVEN LESS COMPELLING THAN THOSE OF MIZZOU LEADERSHIP GIVEN THE WHINY NATURE OF STUDENTS?? COMPLAINTS. MEDIA COVERAGE OF ROCHON??S RESIGNATION IMPLIES THAT ITHACA WAS BESET BY A SERIES OF ESCALATING RACIST INCIDENTS ON CAMPUS BUT IN REALITY THERE WERE JUST TWO SUCH GRIEVANCES. NEITHER STANDS UP TO SCRUTINY AND NEITHER SUGGEST THAT ROCHON??S REFUSAL TO INTERVENE WAS A REMOVABLE OFFENSE. IN OCTOBER ITHACA HOSTED AN ALUMNI PANEL DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC OF IMPROVING THE COLLEGE??S EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE FOR STUDENTS. ONE PANELIST ??09 ALUM TATIANI SY A BLACK WOMAN DESCRIBED HERSELF AS POSSESSING A ??SAVAGE HUNGER.? ANOTHER PANELIST ??76 ALUM CHRISTOPHER BURCH??AN OLDER WHITE MAN??PRAISED SY??S COMMENT AND THEN BEGAN REFERRING TO HER AS ??THE SAVAGE.? IT??S CLEAR FROM VIDEO FOOTAGE OF THE EXCHANGE THAT BURCH WAS NOT USING THE WORD DISPARAGINGLY: IN HIS MIND HE HAD GIVEN HER A COMPLIMENTARY NICKNAME. THIS WAS REMARKABLY POOR JUDGMENT ON HIS PART TO BE SURE AND AFTER HE REALIZED HIS WORD CHOICE HAD BEEN INTERPRETED MALICIOUSLY HE PROFUSELY APOLOGIZED. FAR FROM FAILING TO ADDRESS THE NON-ISSUE ROCHON RELEASED A STATEMENT OF APOLOGY AS WELL: IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE EVENT I (TOM ROCHON) APOLOGIZED TO THE ALUMNA TO WHOM THE COMMENTS WERE ADDRESSED. WE REGRET THAT WHAT WAS INTENDED TO BE A VISIONARY MOMENT FOR OUR COMMUNITY WAS DIMINISHED BY INSENSITIVE COMMENTS. IN GENERAL THE COLLEGE CANNOT PREVENT THE USE OF HURTFUL LANGUAGE ON CAMPUS. SUCH LANGUAGE INTENTIONAL OR UNINTENTIONAL EXISTS IN THE WORLD AND WILL SEEP INTO OUR COMMUNITY. WE CAN??T PROMISE THAT THE COLLEGE WILL NEVER HOST A SPEAKER WHO COULD SAY SOMETHING RACIST HOMOPHOBIC MISOGYNISTIC OR OTHERWISE DISRESPECTFUL. EVEN SO WE REAFFIRM OUR COMMITMENT TO MAKING OUR CAMPUS AN INCLUSIVE AND RESPECTFUL COMMUNITY. THE FACT THAT THESE ENTIRELY REASONABLE WELL-JUSTIFIED SENTIMENTS PROVOKED AN OUTCRY FROM STUDENTS WHO THOUGHT ROCHON WAS NEGLECTING THEIR FEELINGS IS A TESTAMENT TO JUST HOW FAR THE OVERTON WINDOW HAS SHIFTED IN FAVOR OF THE MICROAGGRESSED MASSES ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES. ROCHON BEARS EVEN LESS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE OTHER RACIAL INCIDENT: A ??PREPS AND CROOKS? THEME PARTY HOSTED BY THE ALPHA EPSILON PI FRATERNITY. ACCORDING TO THE ITHACAN THE PROPER ATTIRE FOR ??CROOKS? WAS DESCRIBED AS ??90S THUGGISH STYLE?? COME WEARING A BANDANA BAGGY SWEATS AND A T-SHIRT SNAPBACK AND ANY ??BLING?? YOU CAN FIND.? STUDENTS FOUND THIS DESCRIPTION ??PROBLEMATIC? AND ITHACA VICE PRESIDENT BENJAMIN RIFKIN SWIFTLY CONDEMNED ITS ??DESTRUCTIVE IMPACT.? STUDENTS HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BE UPSET ABOUT THE PARTY THEME??ALTHOUGH THEY ARE TRULY PRIVILEGED PEOPLE IF THIS IS THE MOST VEXING THING IN THEIR LIVES??BUT?ŸOTHER?ŸSTUDENTS HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO THROW COSTUME PARTIES THAT DON??T QUITE MEET OFFENDED PERSONS?? EXPECTATIONS. SIMILARLY THE CAMPUS ADMINISTRATION SHOULD FEEL FREE TO CONDEMN INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR BUT HAS NO BUSINESS PREVENTING IT. COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE ADULTS AND SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO PARTY AS THEY PLEASE WITHOUT FEAR OF INSTITUTIONAL SANCTION. IN ANY CASE ROCHON EVENTUALLY DECIDED TO HIRE A CHIEF DIVERSITY OFFICER ACCORDING TO NPR AND HUMOR HIS ANGRY STUDENT AS BEST HE COULD. BUT THIS WASN??T ENOUGH FOR THEM. IT??S DOUBTFUL ANYTHING WOULD HAVE BEEN. IN NOVEMBER THREE-QUARTERS OF PARTICIPATING STUDENTS VOTED ??NO CONFIDENCE? IN ROCHON??S LEADERSHIP. A WHOPPING 78 PERCENT OF THE FACULTY DID THE SAME. THOSE ARE STUNNING NUMBERS??AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THE ITHACA COMMUNITY THINKS ITS PRESIDENT WAS DOING A BAD JOB. BUT GIVEN THAT THEY CAN CITE NO TANGIBLE REASONS BEYOND THE SEVERAL INSTANCES OF ALLEGED RACIAL INSENSITIVITY WE ARE FORCED TO CONFRONT THE PLAN TRUTH: ITHACA IS NOT A SAFE-SPACE FOR THE THINNEST TRACES OF DISSENT FROM ORGANIZED POLITICAL CORRECTNESS. ROCHON ISN??T STEPPING DOWN ANYTIME SOON??HIS RESIGNATION ISN??T EFFECTIVE UNTIL?ŸJULY 1 2017??WHICH MEANS HE WILL STILL BE DEALING WITH UNRULY STUDENTS AND PROFESSORS FOR QUITE SOME TIME. HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO LISTEN TO STUDENTS?? CONCERNS??AND DEFEND THEIR ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO MAKE SUCH CONCERNS PUBLIC??WHILE STILL CARVING OUT A SPACE FOR EVERYONE ELSE TO SAY AND DO IMPERFECT THINGS WITHOUT GETTING RUN OFF CAMPUS. IN ANY CASE IT??S TIME TO START TAKING STUDENT PROTESTERS SERIOUSLY. FRUSTRATED STUDENTS CLEARLY HAVE TREMENDOUS POWER TO BEND UNIVERSITIES TO THEIR WILL. EVERYONE WHO DOESN??T WANT TO SEE COLLEGE CAMPUSES TRANSFORMED INTO ZONES OF CODDLING WHERE LANGUAGE IS POLICED AND EXPRESSION STRICTLY REGULATED BY ADMINISTRATORS??AT THE BEHEST OF LEFT-WING ACTIVISTS??SHOULD DENOUNCE THE PROTESTERS FOR FIXATING ON TRIVIAL ISSUES INSTEAD OF FUNDAMENTALLY LARGER INEQUALITIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION. JUST IMAGINE WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IF HYPER-OFFENDED STUDENTS CARED HALF AS MUCH ABOUT THE OUT-OF-CONTROL COST OF ATTENDING ITHACA COLLEGE AS THEY DID ABOUT WHAT THEIR NEIGHBORS WERE WEARING TO FRAT PARTIES.

1056,10210588.0,2016-01-23T05:13:00+00:00,MEXICO??S SECRET NARCO MUSEUM ,HIDDEN IN THE SMOG-RIDDEN NORTH OF MEXICO CITY INSIDE THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE??OR MEXICAN ARMY HQ??SITS ONE OF THE MOST FASCINATING MUSEUMS ON THE PLANET. THE ARMY HUMBLY CALLS IT THE MUSEO DE ENERVANTES WHICH CAN BE ROUGHLY TRANSLATED AS THE MUSEUM OF STUPEFACIENTS. BUT THIS BORING TECHNICAL TITLE UNDERPLAYS THE INCREDIBLE COLLECTION OF ARTIFACTS ON DISPLAY THE HIGHLIGHTS OF WHAT MEXICAN SOLDIERS HAVE NABBED FROM DRUG TRAFFICKERS. SOME SEIZED NARCOTICS THEMSELVES ARE IN THE CABINETS BUT THESE ARE THE LEAST INTERESTING ITEMS. A LOT OF PEOPLE ALREADY KNOW WHAT MARIJUANA CRYSTAL METH AND HEROIN LOOK LIKE (ALTHOUGH THE BLACK COCAINE ON SHOW IS A NOVELTY). THE DRUG LAB MACHINERY IS MORE ENTHRALLING INCLUDING SPRAWLING SHINY CONTRAPTIONS TO COOK METH ON AN INDUSTRIAL SCALE. PIECES FROM TRAP CARS THE VEHICLES USED TO SMUGGLE DRUGS OVER THE BORDER IN GAS TANKS TIRES AND FALSE SEATS ALSO ILLUSTRATE THE INGENUITY OF NARCO ENGINEERS. MORE FRIGHTENING IS THE HEAVY WEAPONS ROOM OF CAPTURED CARTEL FIREPOWER YOU SEE THAT NARCO THUGS DON??T ONLY USE BELT-DRIVEN MACHINE GUNS AND GRENADES THEY EVEN POSSESS SHOULDER-HELD ROCKET LAUNCHERS SUCH AS THE RPG-29 OR ??VAMPIRE? WHICH CAN TAKE OUT TANKS. BUT THE MUSEUM??S MAIN ATTRACTION IS UNDOUBTEDLY A ROOM UNDER THE TITLE NARCO CULTURA. THE NARCO CULTURE CABINETS DISPLAY THE OSTENTATIOUS BLING THAT DRUG LORDS BUY WITH THEIR BILLIONS OF BLOODSTAINED BUCKS. SOME PIECES ARE WORTH HIGH FIVE DIGITS IN THE STONES AND METAL ALONE. GUNS ARE BATHED IN GOLD AND DECORATED WITH GEMS IN THE SHAPES OF WORDS AND PICTURES. SOME STONES FORM THE NAMES OF THEIR CAPO OWNERS SUCH AS A PISTOL WITH AN ENGRAVING OF ACF??AMADO CARRILLO FUENTES THE LORD OF THE SKIES. OTHERS HAVE IMAGES OF MEXICAN REVOLUTIONARIES WHO THE GANGSTERS HAIL AS HEROES INCLUDING EMILIANO ZAPATA AND PANCHO VILLA. OTHERS STILL HAVE NAMES OF FASHION DESIGNERS SUCH AS THE ITALIAN TAILOR VERSACE. I FIND IT BEMUSING THAT DRUG LORDS CAN PRAISE BOTH REVOLUTIONARIES AND ENTREPRENEURS THEY ARE REBEL CAPITALISTS. THE NARCO MEMORABILIA EXTENDS TO AWARDS THAT CARTEL ARMIES GIVE THEIR WARRIORS FOR BRAVERY. A MEDALLION FROM THE ZETAS HAS A LETTER Z ON ONE SIDE AND PICTURE OF GANGSTER SOLDIERS IN HEROIC BATTLE POSES ON THE OTHER. IT IS THE NARCO EQUIVALENT OF THE VICTORIA CROSS??OR TIFFANY CROSS. WALKING ON THROUGH THE HALL YOU SEE A COWBOY WAISTCOAT WHICH IS REALLY A BULLET-PROOF VEST A CELL PHONE BATHED IN GOLD AND A CARVED WOODEN CHAIR IN THE FORM OF THE GRIM REAPER. IT GETS WEIRDER AND WEIRDER. DOMINATING THE END OF THE NARCO CULTURE HALL IS THE WEIRDEST ITEM OF ALL: A FOUR-FOOT HIGH STATUETTE OF A SAINTLY WARRIOR CLAD IN MEDIEVAL ARMOR. IT??S AN IMPRESSIVE PIECE OF ART. ITS CORE IS A PLASTER FIGURINE WHICH IS WORKED OVER WITH GOLD AND GEMS FOR THE COAT OF MAIL AND FINE PAINT FOR THE SKIN AND GOATEE BEARD. THE CRUSADER VAUNTS RED TEMPLAR CROSSES ON HIS CHEST AND SLEEVES AND CLASPS A BROADSWORD. HE HAS THAT DESPONDENT EXPRESSION OF A HOLY MAN WISE BUT SAD AS SEEN ON IMAGES OF JESUS AND HIS SAINTS. HE ALSO RESEMBLES ONE OF MEXICO??S MOST BRUTAL GANGSTER WARLORDS. SOLDIERS SEIZED THE STATUETTE FROM CARTEL THUGS WHO BAPTIZED THEMSELVES AS THE KNIGHTS TEMPLAR AFTER THE ORDER OF WARRIOR MONKS WHO FOUGHT FOR CHRISTENDOM BETWEEN 1119 AND 1312. THE NARCO TEMPLARS MADE DOZENS OF SIMILAR STATUETTES AND PUT THEM IN SHRINES TO KNEEL AND PRAY BEFORE. THEY CALL THEM ??SANTOS NAZARIOS.? IT IS THE IMAGE OF THEIR LEADER NAZARIO MORENO KNOWN AS EL CHAYO OR EL M?­S LOCO??THE MADDEST ONE. TROOPS HAVE ALSO FOUND PRAYERS TO SAINT NAZARIO PRINTED IN BOOKLETS IN THE STYLE OF REGULAR CATHOLIC PRAYER BOOKS THAT VENDORS SELL AT THE STOPLIGHTS IN MEXICAN CITIES. AS ONE SAYS: GIVE ME HOLY PROTECTION THROUGH SAINT NAZARIO PROTECTOR OF THE POOREST KNIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE SAINT NAZARIO GIVE US LIFE. ANTHROPOLOGISTS CAN HAVE A FIELD DAY DISSECTING THIS NARCO HOLY IMAGE. SAINT NAZARIO MIXES LATIN AMERICA??S POPULAR CATHOLICISM WITH THE BLING OF THE DRUG TRADE WITH THE ROCK-STAR STATUS OF CRIME LORDS. PERSONALLY WHEN I FIRST SEE A NARCOTICS TRAFFICKER LOOKING LIKE JESUS IT SEEMS HILARIOUS THEN I THINK ABOUT IT FOR THIRTY SECONDS AND REALIZE IT??S TERRIFYING. ADDING TO NAZARIO??S CULT STATUS HE WROTE HIS OWN HOLY BOOK. JOURNALISTS OFTEN REFER TO IT AS HIS BIBLE. BUT MIS PENSAMIENTOS (MY THOUGHTS) DOESN??T HAVE COMPLETE RELIGIOUS STORIES AND PARABLES LIKE THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE. INSTEAD IT IS A COLLECTION OF MUSINGS SIMILAR IN STRUCTURE TO MAO TSE-TUNG??S LITTLE RED BOOK. AS NAZARIO AUTHORED HIS RELIGIOUS RANT NAMED HIS CARTEL AFTER CRUSADING MONKS AND WAS VENERATED LIKE A SAINT THIS DOMINATES COVERAGE ABOUT HIM. IN JOURNALESE SHORTHAND HE IS ??THE HEAD OF THE BIZARRELY NAMED KNIGHTS TEMPLAR WHO WROTE HIS OWN BIBLE EVEN AS HE TRAFFICKED TONS OF CRYSTAL METH TO THE UNITED STATES.? BUT THESE ENTERTAINING DETAILS OVERSHADOW OTHER FEATURES OF NAZARIO??S EMPIRE THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTANDING WHAT MEXICAN ORGANIZED CRIME HAS BECOME. NAZARIO MOVED FROM DRUG TRAFFICKING TO A PORTFOLIO OF CRIMES THAT MADE HIM A MAJOR PLAYER IN THE LOCAL ECONOMY??A GANGSTER CAPITALIST. THE KNIGHTS TEMPLAR TOOK OVER IRON MINES IGNORING ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS SO THEY COULD SELL RECORD QUANTITIES OF METAL TO HUNGRY CHINESE FACTORIES. THEY TOOK EXTORTION TO NEW EXTREMES MAKING CENTS OF EVERY DOLLAR THAT MOVED EVEN FROM BIG BUSINESS AND ATTACKING THOSE WHO DIDN??T PAY (THEY BURNED THIRTY TRUCKS OF A LOCAL UNIT OF PEPSICO). AND THEY WADED INTO THE AVOCADO LIME AND CATTLE INDUSTRIES. FOR AMERICANS YOUR GUACAMOLE ON GAME DAY THE METAL IN YOUR KID??S REMOTE-CONTROLLED CAR AND THE BEEF IN YOUR BURGER MAY HAVE PASSED THROUGH THE KNIGHTS TEMPLARS?? HANDS??ALONGSIDE THE METH SMOKED BY YOUR LOCAL FIEND. IN HIS HOME STATE OF MICHOAC?­N THE MADDEST ONE GOT HIS TENTACLES INTO THE ENTIRE POLITICAL AND JUDICIAL APPARATUS. WITH MAYORS POLICE COMMANDERS AND POLITICIANS ON HIS PAYROLL THE STATE APPARATUS ROTTED TO THE CORE??MAKING IT LATER IMPLODE LIKE A PUTRID TREE TRUNK. NAZARIO??S RULE WAS SO INSIDIOUS AND BRUTAL IT ULTIMATELY UNLEASHED MEXICO??S LARGEST VIGILANTE MOVEMENT TO TAKE HIM DOWN. THE SO-CALLED AUTODEFENSAS??OR SELF-DEFENSE SQUADS??BECAME A SIGNIFICANT THIRD FORCE IN THE MEXICAN DRUG WAR FIGHTING ALONGSIDE THE GOVERNMENT SECURITY FORCES AND CARTEL DEATH SQUADS. THE MILITIAS UNLEASHED A BLOODY BUT BEWILDERING BATTLE. THEY BUILT A NETWORK OF BARRICADES THAT WEAVED THROUGH THE STATE THEY TOOK BACK TOWNS THAT THE GOVERNMENT SUPPOSEDLY CONTROLLED ALREADY SOMETIMES THEY FOUGHT ALONGSIDE THE MEXICAN ARMY SOMETIMES AGAINST THEM. THE CONFLICT EMBARRASSED PRESIDENT PE?ÑA NIETO AND LED HIS GOVERNMENT TO MAKE A DANGEROUS ALLIANCE WITH THE VIGILANTES. MIGRANTS IN THE UNITED STATES WERE ALSO KEY IN TOPPLING NAZARIO. MICHOAC?­N ??MIGR??S FROM CALIFORNIA TO OREGON WERE SO DISTRAUGHT BY THE TERROR IN THEIR HOMELAND THEY HELPED FINANCE THE VIGILANTE MOVEMENT. SOME RETURNED HOME AND TOOK UP KALASHNIKOVS. I FOUND IMMIGRANTS ON THE FRONTLINE WHO WENT WITHIN WEEKS FROM WASHING DISHES IN LOS ANGELES TO FIGHTING GUN BATTLES AGAINST CARTEL HIT MEN. AND IF THAT ISN??T ENOUGH COLOR FOR NAZARIO??S CRAZY TALE THE NARCO SAINT ALSO DIED TWICE. A DRUG LORD OF THE MADDEST ONE??S STATUS HAS MULTIPLE LIVES. ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ *** NAZARIO FIRST DIED IN DECEMBER 2010. MEXICAN FEDERAL POLICE CLAIMED THEY KILLED HIM DURING ONE OF THE MOST FEROCIOUS BATTLES OF THE MEXICAN DRUG WAR: A FIGHT INVOLVING TWO THOUSAND FEDERAL OFFICERS AND ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED CRIMINAL GUNMEN. AMID THE MELEE THE OFFICERS SAID THEY SHOT NAZARIO BUT HIS GANGSTER HENCHMEN CARRIED HIS CORPSE AWAY. HIS DEATH WAS CONFIRMED WHEN A GRAVE APPEARED WITH HIS NAME ON IT. (APPARENTLY POLICE DIDN??T WANT TO DIG IT UP AND CHECK.) THE PRESIDENT AT THE TIME FELIPE CALDER??N TRUMPETED NAZARIO??S DEMISE AS A GRAND VICTORY IN HIS WAR ON CARTELS. IT WAS ESPECIALLY SWEET AS MICHOAC?­N IS CALDER??N??S HOME STATE AND THE PLACE WHERE THE PRESIDENT HAD LAUNCHED HIS CAMPAIGN AGAINST ORGANIZED CRIME. AFTER HIS SUPPOSED DEATH NAZARIO??S FOLLOWERS BEGAN VENERATING HIM LIKE A SAINT AND STATUETTES AND SHRINES APPEARED. EVEN MORE BIZARRELY PEOPLE REPORTED SEEING HIS GHOST WANDERING AROUND MICHOAC?­N DRESSED ALL IN WHITE. UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THIS PHANTOM SAINT THE KNIGHTS TEMPLAR BECAME MORE POWERFUL THAN EVER. BY 2014 THE SIGHTINGS OF GHOST NAZARIO HAD BECOME ABSURDLY COMMON ON A SINGLE DAY I SPOKE TO THREE PEOPLE WHO CLAIMED THEY HAD SEEN HIM. BUT I STILL WASN??T SURE. I DISCUSSED THE TESTIMONIES WITH A FELLOW JOURNALIST. WERE THESE SOURCES REALLY SEEING HIM WE ASKED. OR WAS THIS A FIGMENT OF THEIR COLLECTIVE IMAGINATION? THE FORMER TURNED OUT TO BE TRUE. IN MARCH 2014 MEXICAN MARINES ANNOUNCED THAT NAZARIO WAS STILL ALIVE. BUT THEY ALSO SAID THAT THEY NOW HAD KILLED HIM. REALLY. THIS BIZARRE SITUATION REMINDS ME OF A QUOTE ATTRIBUTED TO SPANISH SURREALIST ARTIST SALVADOR DAL??. THE MASTER SUPPOSEDLY SAID: ??I WON??T RETURN TO MEXICO BECAUSE IT IS A COUNTRY THAT IS MORE SURREAL THAN MY PAINTINGS.? TO PROVE THAT NAZARIO WAS TRULY IN HEAVEN (OR HELL) THE MARINES RELEASED A VIDEO OF HIS BODY. IT CERTAINLY LOOKS LIKE HIM. HOWEVER WHILE THE MARINES SAY THEY KILLED THE MADDEST ONE WITH TWO BULLETS IN THE CHEST THIS FILM SHOWS A FACE THAT HAS BLATANTLY BEEN BEATEN THE EYELIDS BLACK AND NOSE PURPLE. IN THE MURKY WORLD OF THE MEXICAN DRUG WAR THERE IS ALWAYS A SECOND STORY AND I HEAR A CREDIBLE ACCOUNT THAT EXPLAINS THIS BRUISING. ACCORDING TO THIS ALTERNATIVE VERSION OF EVENTS NAZARIO WASN??T REALLY KILLED BY MARINES BUT HE WAS BATTERED TO DEATH BY HIS OWN BODYGUARDS WORKING WITH VIGILANTES. IT IS OF COURSE ILLEGAL FOR VIGILANTES TO MURDER PEOPLE (IN THEORY). SO THE VIGILANTES HANDED IN THE CORPSE AND IT WAS CONVENIENT FOR EVERYONE TO SAY THE MARINES DID IT. THE BODYGUARDS HAD GOT SO FED UP OF NAZARIO??S MEGALOMANIA THEY TURNED ON HIM. HIS FINAL LEGACY WAS NOT OF HIS TROOPS VENERATING HIM BUT OF THEM HATING HIM. ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ *** NAZARIO??S MESSIANIC COMPLEX ILLUMINATES A MEMOIR HE WROTE. WHILE MOST DRUG LORDS ERASE DETAILS OF THEIR LIVES NAZARIO ACTUALLY SELF-PUBLISHED THIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY AND DISTRIBUTED IT TO HIS FOLLOWERS. IT WAS NEVER ON SALE BUT THOUSANDS OF COPIES FLOWED AROUND MICHOAC?­N TOWNS AND VILLAGES. IT WAS A HOT BOOK. IF SOLDIERS FOUND PEOPLE WITH THEM THEY WOULD OFTEN ARREST THEM FOR BEING TEMPLAR AFLIATES. THE 101 PAGES ARE FITTINGLY TITLED THEY CALL ME ??THE MADDEST ONE.? THE BOOK HAS A FRONT COVER WITH A SILHOUETTE OF NAZARIO??S FACE OVER A DEEP RED BACKGROUND. IT IS REMINISCENT OF A SILHOUETTE IMAGE OF CHE GUEVARA PRINTED ON T-SHIRTS THROUGHOUT LATIN AMERICA. AS WELL AS STYLING HIMSELF AS A MESSIAH NAZARIO FANCIED HIMSELF A GUERRILLA HERO. MADDEST ONE IS WRITTEN IN DECENT GRAMMAR MAYBE WITH THE HELP OF A WRITER WITH A GUN TO HIS HEAD (NAZARIO SAYS HE DIDN??T DO A DAY IN SCHOOL). SPLATTERING ITS PAGES ARE AMUSING SAYINGS SUCH AS ??EVERY NATION HAS THE GOVERNMENT IT DESERVES AND EVERY GOVERNMENT HAS THE CRIMINALS IT DESERVES.? IT ALSO PROVIDES UNUSUAL INSIGHT INTO THE LIFE AND DERANGED MIND OF THIS GANGSTER WARLORD. THE MEMOIR NEEDS TO BE CAREFULLY SCRUTINIZED BUT AGENTS TRACKING HIM CONFIRM MANY OF THE FACTS. A MEXICAN INVESTIGATOR WHO WORKED FOR THE FEDERAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE AND THEN A SPECIAL UNIT FIGHTING THE KNIGHTS TEMPLAR GAVE ME MANY RICH DETAILS ON THE MOB AND SHARED HIS WEALTH OF FILES. DEA AGENTS ALSO HANDED ME INFORMATION ON THE MADDEST ONE. AMONG THE AMERICAN AGENTS WHO TRACKED NAZARIO??S MOB WAS MIKE VIGIL WHO SPENT THIRTEEN YEARS WORKING IN MEXICO MORE THAN ANY OTHER DEA AGENT. HE OFTEN WENT UNDERCOVER POSING AS A DRUG TRAFFICKER TO GET INTO THEIR CRAZED WORLD. DURING VIGIL??S TIME A TRAFFICKER SHOT AT HIM FROM THREE FEET (THE BULLETS MISSED). VIGIL ALSO HAD THE PLEASURE OF TURNING DOWN THE OFFER OF A THREE-MILLION-DOLLAR BRIBE FROM HONDURAN KINGPIN JUAN MATTA BALLESTEROS??WHO WAS LATER CONVICTED OF THE KIDNAPPING OF DEA AGENT ENRIQUE ??KIKE? CAMARENA. HOWEVER WHILE THE AGENTS CONFIRM MANY NAMES AND DATES IN NAZARIO??S ACCOUNT THEY CLASH WITH HIS VISION. NAZARIO PORTRAYS HIMSELF AS A SOCIAL BANDIT SUBTITLING HIS MEMOIR ??DIARY OF AN IDEALIST.? AGENTS SAY HE WAS ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS SERIAL MURDERERS ON THE PLANET WITH FEW REAL IDEALS AT ALL. ??I THINK HE IS A PSYCHOPATH THAT WANTS TO ROMANTICIZE HIS CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES BY WRITING THESE MANIFESTOES? VIGIL SAYS. ??THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT HE IS A DRUG TRAFFICKER HE IS A KILLER AND HE REPRESENTS THE WORST OF MEXICAN SOCIETY BUT HAS THESE DELUSIONAL ROMANTIC IDEAS.? I HAVE LIVED IN MEXICO SINCE 2000 SO MY WORK ON IT GOES DEEPER THAN THE OTHER COUNTRIES COVERED IN THIS BOOK. I ALSO HAD GREAT HELP FROM MICHOAC?­N JOURNALISTS INCLUDING FRANCISCO CASTELLANOS LEO GONZALEZ DALIA MARTINEZ DANIEL FERNANDEZ AND JESUS LEMUS. LEMUS MAY BE THE REPORTER WHO KNOWS MOST ABOUT DRUG CARTELS IN THE WORLD THANKS TO A QUIRK OF FATE HE WAS JAILED FOR THREE YEARS ALONGSIDE TOP CAPOS. IT IS A PAINFUL STORY. HE HAD WRITTEN AN EXPOS?? OF A CORRUPT POLITICIAN AND IN REVENGE PROSECUTORS FILED TRUMPED-UP CHARGES AGAINST HIM ACCUSING HIM OF WORKING FOR NAZARIO. LEMUS THANKFULLY RESISTED DAYS OF TORTURE AND REFUSED TO SIGN A CONFESSION AND THE CHARGES WERE THROWN OUT AFTER THREE EXCRUCIATING YEARS. MY RECONSTRUCTION OF NAZARIO??S LIFE IS ALSO HELPED BY MANY PEOPLE FROM HIS HOMELAND WHO KNEW HIM. THE VIGILANTE UPRISING TO TOPPLE THE MADDEST ONE CREATED A EUPHORIC ATMOSPHERE AND PEOPLE WERE UNUSUALLY OPEN IN REVEALING DETAILS OF THE CRIME WORLD. AMONG THOSE I TALKED TO WHO KNEW NAZARIO WERE SEVERAL OF HIS GUNMEN WHO LATER BECAME VIGILANTES APATZING?­N BUSINESSMEN CRISTOBAL ALVAREZ A WOMAN MARRIED TO NAZARIO??S COUSIN AND A LIME FARMER WHO TEMPLARS TORTURED WHILE NAZARIO WAS PRESENT. THE VALLEY HE HAILS FROM IS A TIGHT-KNIT COMMUNITY WITH BROAD INTER- LINKING FAMILIES. IT IS A LAND BLIGHTED BY POVERTY CRIMINALITY AND BELIEFS IN THE SUPERNATURAL. THESE FEATURES ALL HELPED MOLD THE NARCO SAINT AND HIS LEGEND FROM WHEN HE WAS A SMALL CHILD. EXCERPTED FROM IOAN GRILLO??S GANGSTER WARLORDS (BLOOMSBURY PRESS 2016) ,18964.0

HAVE YOU DONE THE READING EQUIVALENT OF PUTTING YOUR HANDS OVER YOUR EARS AND SHOUTING ??LALALA? AS SOMEONE TRIES TO IMPART VITAL INFORMATION TO YOU? HAVE YOU IN SHORT DEFIED EVERY INTRUDING TENTACLE OF MODERN MEDIA TO ENSURE YOU CAN WATCH THE FINAL SEASON OF DOWNTON ABBEY IN AMERICAN TIME RATHER THAN BRITISH? IF SO CONGRATULATIONS AND I ASSUME YOU HAVE THE CUCUMBER SANDWICHES POTS OF TEA AND DENSE FRUITCAKE IN HAND FOR SUNDAY NIGHT??S PREMIERE. (THEDAILY BEAST??S REVIEWS WILL RUN AFTER EACH EPISODE.) DOWNTON ABBEY FINALLY FINISHED ITS LIFE IN THE UK ON CHRISTMAS DAY AND IT DID SO WITH A FLOOD OF ARTICLES AND REVIEWS NONE OF WHICH WILL BE LINKED TO HERE. BECAUSE LALALA. ONE HEADLINE GAVE SOMETHING HUGE AWAY TO THIS READER WHOSE EYES ALIGHTED UPON THE HEADLINE BEFORE REALIZING WHAT THE HEADLINE WAS. IN THAT SPLIT SECOND THERE WAS BOTH HORROR AND A DETERMINED SELF-IMPOSED AMNESIA ON WHAT HAD BEEN SEEN. FIVE DAYS LATER I AM AGAIN NONE THE WISER. I KNOW NOTHING. I MUST KNOW NOTHING. DO NOT TELL ME ANYTHING. LALALA. SO WHAT DO WE WANT FOR THIS MERRY BAND OF POSHOS THEIR SERVANTS AND THAT HONEY-COLORED HOUSE OF INTRIGUE? WE LEFT THEM AT THE END OF SEASON FIVE IN VARIOUS STATES OF ROMANTIC AND PERSONAL CHAOS. I THINK IT??S NOT TOO MUCH OF A LEAP TO SUGGEST THERE IS A CONSENSUS THAT MRS. HUGHES AND MR. CARSON SHOULD INDEED PROCEED HAPPILY TO THE ALTAR. HOWEVER THIS IS DOWNTON ABBEY AND AS MRS. HUGHES FOR SOME REASON HAD A HUGE WHERE-THE-HELL-DID-THAT-COME-FROM? SPEECH AT THE END OF SEASON FIVE ABOUT HAVING TO TAKE CARE OF PSYCHOTIC RELATIVES PERHAPS THEIR JOURNEY TO MARITAL BLISS WILL NOT COME WITHOUT A BUG-EYED SISTER APPEARING OUT OF A SHADOWS WITH A ROLLING PIN. UNLESS SERIES CREATOR AND WRITER JULIAN FELLOWES HAS HAD ANOTHER IDEA FOR THEM BETS MUST ALSO BE PLACED ON WHO OUT OF MR. OR MRS. BATES WILL SPEND THE DURATION OF SEASON SIX WRONGLY ACCUSED OF MURDER AND IN JAIL. CURRENTLY IT??S MRS. BATES FACING THE SLAMMER BUT THIS IS ONLY UNTIL MR. BATES FINDS SOMEONE EVIL ASSOCIATED WITH THE CASE AND DOESN??T KILL THEM BUT LOOKS LIKE HE DOES AND THEN HE IS WRONGLY ACCUSED OF IT AND THEN ENDS UP?? UNLESS. UNLESS. UNLESS JULIAN FELLOWES CAN THINK OF SOMETHING NEW TO PUT MR. AND MRS. BATES THROUGH WHICH DOESN??T INVOLVE A WRONGFUL MURDER ACCUSATION. I KNOW. RADICAL SUGGESTION. JUST SAYING. SIMILARLY: EDITH. THE UGLY DUCKLING CHILD HAS BASICALLY BEEN FELLOWES?? PUNCHING BAG SINCE THE STORY??S START. FIRST IT WAS HER PLAINNESS AND DOURNESS THAT WAS BITCHILY TARGETED BY HER GLAMOROUS MAN-MAGNET OLDER SIS. THEN FELLOWES PUT EDITH THROUGH A SUCCESSION OF HURTFUL HUMILIATING ROMANTIC DISASTERS. THEN SHE GAVE BIRTH TO A BABY THAT SHAME DICTATED SHE GIVE AWAY BUT HAVE NEAR. THEN THAT BABY WAS INTRODUCED TO HER HOME AS AN ORPHAN WHICH SHE WOULD TAKE CARE OF. IN SEASON SIX EDITH AND MARY WILL SURELY BOTH BE SHOWN PURSUING CAREER-ORIENTED PATHS??BOTH VERY DIFFERENT AND BOTH PROBABLY DERAILED BY ROMANTIC INTRIGUES. HOW LONG CAN EDITH OR POOR EDITH AS HER MANY FANS KNOW AND LOVE HER GO THROUGH THIS CYCLE OF RELENTLESS DEGRADATION AND HAVING EMOTIONAL EXCREMENT THROWN AT HER? WE MAY WANT EDITH TO HAVE A HAPPY ENDING??I WANT IT MORE POWERFULLY THAN I WANT MARY TO HAVE ONE OR CORA TO HAVE A FULL-BLOODED STORYLINE OF HER OWN??BUT YOU SENSE FELLOWES IS GOING TO PUT HER THROUGH YET MORE LUDICROUS WRINGERS TO GET THERE. AS FOR LADY MARY SHE HAD A BOTTLENECK OF POSH SUITORS BY THE END OF LAST SEASON: HANDSOME CHAPS WITH CHISELED JAWS BUT ALL TRULY DREARY AND DULL. THE PROBLEM WITH MARY IS THAT SHE CAN NEVER OUTDO HER INITIAL LOVE STORY WITH MATTHEW AND THE DEATH OF MR. PAMUK. BUT MORE MEN COME FOR HER ARMED WITH DEFROSTING GUNS IN SEASON SIX. I WANT TO KNOW NOTHING ELSE. LALALA. IT SEEMS KIND OF RIDICULOUS THAT THEY DON??T PUT HER TOGETHER WITH BRANSON HER DEAD SISTER??S SURVIVING HUSBAND. IT IS RUINING NOTHING TO REVEAL HE IS COMING BACK FOR SEASON SIX. A GOOD ENDING MUST SURELY BE IN LINE FOR BARROW WHOM WE LAST SAW SCHEMING FOR GOOD AGAINST LORD SINDERBY IN SEASON FIVE. THE FORMERLY TOTAL EVIL CLOSETED GAY FOOTMAN HAS BEEN SOFTENED OF LATE??AND AFTER A DISPIRITING FLIRTATION WITH REPARATIVE THERAPY MAY BE SET TO HOLD HIS NASCENT RAINBOW FLAG A LITTLE MORE PROUDLY. LORD GRANTHAM AND CORA CAN ONLY BE ROCKED BY SOMETHING TOTALLY UNPREDICTABLE??EVEN REGULAR VIEWERS HAVE TIRED OF HOW MANY TIMES DOWNTON ITSELF CAN BE IN PERIL??ALTHOUGH SEASON SIX WILL SURELY OPEN UP A NEW AVENUE OF THIS PERENNIAL FAVORITE.

THE BAREST OF THINGS WE DO KNOW OR MAY CARE TO KNOW GOING INTO SEASON SIX: IT IS 1925 THE ESTATE??YES??IS GOING THROUGH YET MORE CHANGE AS IN A MIRROR TO MODERN RECESSIONARY TIMES??THE HIGH COSTS OF RUNNING DOWNTON MEAN SERVANTS MAY BE IN THE FIRING LINE. TEXTS FROM FRIENDS IN LONDON??SHUT UP LALALA??SUGGEST THAT HAPPY ENDINGS ARE IN ORDER. BUT THE SOFT DRIVING WINDS AROUND DOWNTON HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT ??CHANGE?? AND ITS IMMINENCE AND ITS INEVITABILITY. EVEN WHEN EPISODES ARE BAD AND STORYLINES DRIFT INCOMPREHENSIBLY FOR MONTHS AT A TIME??AS WITH THE BATES??S AND THEIR WRONGFUL IMPRISONMENTS??THERE IS STILL THE CHARM OF A SOUP COMPETITION OR THE PARRYING BANTER BETWEEN THE COUNTESS DOWAGER AND ISOBEL CRAWLEY??A FAVORITE OF THIS VIEWERS PLAYED BEAUTIFULLY BY PENELOPE WILTON.

NOT AT THE MOMENT IT??S HAPPENING.? WALLACE??WHO HAS NORMALIZED RELATIONS WITH THE REPUBLICAN FRONTRUNNER HAVING CONDUCTED THREE SUNDAY SHOW INTERVIEWS WITH?ŸHIM SINCE THE GREAT DEBATE??IS AGNOSTIC ON WHETHER TRUMP??S REPEATED DENIALS THAT HE WAS MAKING A SNIDE COMMENT ABOUT KELLY??S MENSTRUAL CYCLE (DENIALS THAT ARE WIDELY DISBELIEVED WITHIN FOX NEWS) ARE TO BE CREDITED. ??I DON??T HAVE A CLUE? HE SAYS. ??I WOULDN??T EVER PRESUME TO TRY TO READ DONALD TRUMP??S MIND.? WALLACE IS MORE SKEPTICAL ABOUT TRUMP??S INSISTENCE THAT IN MAKING FUN OF NEW YORK TIMES REPORTER SERGE KOVALESKI DURING A CAMPAIGN RALLY IN SOUTH CAROLINA HE NEVER INTENDED TO MOCK KOVALESKI??S PHYSICAL DISABILITY A CHRONIC CONDITION CALLED ARTHROGRYPOSIS WHICH DEFORMS AND RESTRICTS THE MOVEMENT OF HIS HANDS AND ARMS. ??I THINK THAT??S A HARDER ONE TO DENY? WALLACE SAYS. ALONE AMONG SUNDAY SHOW ANCHORS TO SAY NOTHING OF ALMOST EVERYONE ELSE ON CABLE HE HAS STEADFASTLY REFUSED TO ALLOW TRUMP TO PHONE IT IN. ??IT WASN??T SO MUCH THAT I ENFORCED IT BUT I WAS SHOCKED WHEN THE OTHER SHOWS SUDDENLY STARTED DOING PHONERS? WALLACE SAYS. ??I HAD NEVER HEARD OF THAT TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE IN THE LONG HISTORY OF SUNDAY TALK SHOWS. I UNDERSTAND WHY SOME OF MY COMPETITORS DID THAT. YOU GET A CHEAP QUICK RATINGS HIT BY HAVING DONALD TRUMP ON EVEN IF IT??S A PHONER BUT I THINK IT KIND OF DEVALUES THE CURRENCY?? ??THE SUNDAY TALK SHOW IS THE PLACE WHERE YOU??RE SUPPOSED TO GET IN-DEPTH HARD-HITTING WELL-RESEARCHED INTERVIEWS WHERE YOU SEE THE BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE INTERVIEWER AND THE GUEST AND YOU CAN??T DO THAT IF YOU DON??T KNOW WHETHER A POLITICIAN IS IN HIS PAJAMAS OR HAS HIS TALKING POINTS IN FRONT OF HIM.? MOST OF THE HEAT SURROUNDING THE UPCOMING DEBATE OF COURSE SURROUNDS THE MEDIA??S EXPECTATION??MAKE THAT HOPE??OF FIREWORKS BETWEEN THE REPUBLICAN FRONTRUNNER AND FOX NEWS??S PRIME-TIME STAR KELLY.

THE NOTION THAT A MAN WHO ASPIRES TO BE COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD WOULD SPEND SO MUCH TIME AND EFFORT TRASH-TALKING A TELEVISION PERSONALITY??OR FOR THAT MATTER THAT A REALITY TV STAR WOULD DOMINATE A PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE??SIMPLY ATTESTS TO THE STRANGE AND UNPREDICTABLE NATURE OF THE 2016 CAMPAIGN. TRUMP ??HAS BECOME QUITE AN EFFECTIVE POLITICIAN? SAYS WALLACE WHO HAS BEEN COVERING PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS SINCE 1980 AND JOINED FOX NEWS IN 2003 AFTER A CAREER AT NBC AND ABC. ??YOU CAN AGREE WITH HIM OR NOT. YOU CAN THINK HE??S MORE OF A SHOWMAN THAN A SERIOUS STATESMAN.

BUT HE BEGAN TO SEE HIM AS A CREDIBLE CONTENDER AFTER INTERVIEWING HIM IN OCTOBER. ??I DIDN??T APPRECIATE HIS STANDING WITH A LOT OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC? HE SAYS. ??HE REALLY HAS A VERY ATTRACTIVE BRAND FOR A LOT OF VOTERS. THEY SEE HIM AS A TOUGH GUY A STRAIGHT SHOOTER SOMEBODY WHO??EVEN THOUGH HE??S A MILLIONAIRE??KIND OF SHARES THEIR SENSE OF FRUSTRATION WITH POLITICS AS USUAL.? WALLACE SAYS HE??S ??JUST AS SHOCKED MAYBE EVEN MORE SHOCKED? BY THE RISE OF VERMONT SEN. BERNIE SANDERS A BROOKLYN-ACCENTED DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST??AND A 74-YEAR-OLD JEWISH GUY TO BOOT??WHO HAS BEEN GIVING HILLARY CLINTON FITS IN IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE. ??I THINK IT??S A TESTAMENT TO A COUPLE OF THINGS? WALLACE SAYS. ??CLINTON IS NOT THE MOST GALVANIZING CANDIDATE WE??VE EVER SEEN. AND I THINK THE STEADY DRUMBEAT OF SCANDALS INVOLVING THE EMAILS AND THE CLINTON FOUNDATION HAVE TAKEN THEIR TOLL. AND THE SAME SENSE OF FRUSTRATION THAT??S PROPELLING TRUMP IS ALSO PROPELLING SANDERS. ??AS WE SAW IN 2008 IF PEOPLE HAVE A CHOICE BETWEEN CHANGE OR EXPERIENCE UNLESS THEY??RE REALLY HAPPY??AND THEY AREN??T RIGHT NOW??THEY GOING TO CHOOSE CHANGE.

IN 2011 THE CELEBRATORY CROWDS IN EGYPT??S TAHRIR SQUARE BEGAN GIVING WAY TO ORGANIZED STREET GANGS WHO TARGETED AND RAPED WOMEN OUT IN THE OPEN. PERHAPS THIS WAS A BAD OMEN FOR THINGS TO COME IN THE REGION. GERMANY??S WELCOMING EUPHORIA AT RECEIVING 1.1 MILLION ASYLUM SEEKERS IN 2015 MAY HAVE JUST TURNED A SIMILARLY DARK CORNER. MORE THAN 120 CRIMINAL COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN FILED BY WOMEN IN COLOGNE WHO SAY THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO PUBLIC SEXUAL ASSAULT OR ROBBERY INCLUDING AT LEAST TWO ALLEGED STREET RAPES ALL IN ONE NIGHT. THE 400 MEN ACCUSED OF BEING BEHIND THIS MASS ATTACK FORMED COORDINATED RINGS AROUND THE WOMEN. THEY HAVE BEEN UNIVERSALLY DESCRIBED AS BEING OF NORTH AFRICAN AND ARAB APPEARANCE. POLICE ARE EXAMINING INTERNET FORUMS AND CHAT GROUPS ON THE WORKING ASSUMPTION THAT IT IS UNLIKELY 400 MEN JUST MET BY ACCIDENT. THOUGH THIS ALL OCCURRED ON NEW YEAR??S EVE THE ABSOLUTE SCANDAL IS THAT WE ONLY FOUND OUT ABOUT IT FIVE DAYS LATER. AMID ACCUSATIONS THAT IT DELIBERATELY COVERED THE INCIDENT UP IN ORDER NOT TO SPARK PANIC THE PUBLIC BROADCASTER ZDF WAS FORCED TO ISSUE AN APOLOGY FOR FAILING TO INCLUDE THE ASSAULTS IN ITS MAIN EVENING NEWS BROADCAST. IT APPEARS THAT AS THE AUTHORITIES AND THE MEDIA WERE CHOOSING BETWEEN STIRRING UP RACIAL TENSION AND THESE WOMEN??S RIGHTS WE WERE FACED WITH A CONSPIRACY OF SILENCE. EVENTUALLY THIS WAS BOUND TO HAPPEN. RECENT MASS MIGRATION PATTERNS ACROSS EUROPE HAVE MEANT THAT MISOGYNY HAS FINALLY COME HEAD TO HEAD WITH ANTI-RACISM MULTICULTURALISM IS FACING OFF AGAINST FEMINISM AND PROGRESSIVE VALUES ARE WRESTLING WITH CULTURAL TOLERANCE. YES IT IS RACIST TO SUSPECT THAT ALL BROWN MEN WHO LOOK LIKE ME ARE RAPISTS. IT IS BIGOTED TO PRESUME THAT ALL MUSLIM MEN WHO SHARE MY FAITH ADVOCATE RELIGIOUSLY JUSTIFIED RAPE. IT IS XENOPHOBIC TO ASSUME THAT ALL MALE REFUGEES ARE SEXUAL PREDATORS AWAITING THEIR CHANCE TO RAPE. BUT LET ME BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR: WHAT WILL FEED THIS RACISM BIGOTRY AND XENOPHOBIA EVEN MORE IS DELIBERATELY FAILING TO REPORT THE FACTS AS THEY STAND. DOING SO ONLY ENCOURAGES THE POPULIST RIGHT??S RALLYING CRY AGAINST ??THE ESTABLISHMENT.? IF LIBERALS DO NOT ADDRESS SUCH ISSUES SWIFTLY WITH COMPLETE CANDOR AND COURAGE THE FAR-RIGHT AND ANTI-MUSLIM POPULIST GROUPS WILL GET THERE FIRST. THEY HAVE BEEN DOING SO FOR A WHILE NOW. THE FAR-RIGHT STREET PROTEST GROUP HOGESA OR HOOLIGANS AGAINST SALAFISM CONTINUES TO CAUSE CONSTERNATION ON THE STREETS OF COLOGNE WHILE THE POPULIST-RIGHT PEGIDA HAS ALREADY RESPONDED TO THE NEW YEAR??S EVE ATTACKS BY ANNOUNCING A PROTEST IN COLOGNE ON JAN. 9. NO MY FELLOW LIBERALS THESE ISSUES CANNOT BE BRUSHED UNDER THE CARPET OR SIMPLY WILLED AWAY. THEY ARE NOT GOING ANYWHERE ANYTIME SOON. SO HOW CAN WE ADDRESS THIS SENSIBLY WITHOUT BURSTING A BLOOD VESSEL IN OUR RIGHT EYE OR MISSING THE BLIND SPOT IN OUR LEFT? LET??S START BY LOOKING AT THE EVIDENCE. OFFICIAL FIGURES IN GERMANY SUGGEST THAT CURRENTLY REFUGEES ARE NO MORE LIKELY TO COMMIT SEXUAL CRIMES THAN OTHER SECTIONS OF THE POPULATION. ??REFUGEES COMMIT JUST AS FEW OR AS MANY CRIMES AS GROUPS OF THE LOCAL POPULATION? SAYS GERMANY??S INTERIOR MINISTER THOMAS DE MAIZIERE. THAT??S GOOD NEWS. BANK IT. STREET SEXUAL VIOLENCE IS ALSO??OBVIOUSLY??NOT EXCLUSIVE TO ARAB AND MUSLIM-MAJORITY COUNTRIES. INDEED AMONG THE WORST OFFENDERS IS PAPUA NEW GUINEA WHERE TWO-THIRDS OF WOMEN ARE SUBJECTED TO SOME KIND OF PHYSICAL OR SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND RAPISTS FROM ??RASKOL? GANGS ARE HAPPY TO POSE FOR PHOTOS AFTER THEIR LATEST RAPE. HAVING SAID THAT WHAT IS INFURIATING AND TOTALLY COUNTERPRODUCTIVE IS TO DENY THAT A SPECIFICALLY CULTURAL PROBLEM AROUND IMMIGRATION PATTERNS AND EUROPEAN SEXUAL NORMS HAS BEEN STEADILY RISING ACROSS THE CONTINENT. TO PRETEND THIS IS NOT THE CASE ONLY FURTHER STIGMATIZES US BROWN MUSLIM MEN. THAT THE PROBLEM REQUIRES ATTENTION IS CLEAR. GERMAN POLICE UNIONS AND WOMEN??S RIGHT GROUPS HAVE RECENTLY ACCUSED AUTHORITIES OF UNDERPLAYING CASES OF RAPE AT REFUGEE SHELTERS. ??THERE IS A LOT OF GLOSSING OVER GOING ON. BUT THIS DOESN??T REPRESENT REALITY? POLICE UNION CHIEF RAINER WENDT TOLD REUTERS. HENRY OVE BERG WHO WAS A POLICE CHIEF DURING NORWAY??S RECENT SPIKE IN RAPE CASES SAID ??PEOPLE FROM SOME PARTS OF THE WORLD HAVE NEVER SEEN A GIRL IN A MINISKIRT ONLY IN A BURQA??WHEN THEY GET TO NORWAY SOMETHING HAPPENS IN THEIR HEADS.? HE ADDED THAT ??THERE WAS A LINK BUT NOT A VERY CLEAR LINK? BETWEEN THE RAPE CASES IN NORWAY AND IMMIGRANTS. HANNE KRISTIN ROHDE FORMER HEAD OF THE VIOLENT CRIME SECTION OF THE OSLO POLICE DEPARTMENT WAS CRITICIZED IN 2011 WHEN SHE WENT PUBLIC WITH DATA SUGGESTING THAT IMMIGRANTS COMMITTED A HUGELY DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF RAPES. ??THIS WAS A BIG PROBLEM??BUT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO TALK ABOUT? SHE REMARKED. THERE WAS ??A CLEAR STATISTICAL CONNECTION BETWEEN SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND MALE MIGRANTS.? THIS IS ALL CONTROVERSIAL BUT IT MUST BE SAID. ANECDOTAL ATTITUDES POINT TO THE SAME CONCLUSION. ABDU OSMAN KELIFA AN ERITREAN ASYLUM SEEKER TO NORWAY RECENTLY TOLD THE NEW YORK TIMES THAT IN HIS HOME COUNTRY ??IF SOMEONE WANTS A LADY HE CAN JUST TAKE HER AND HE WILL NOT BE PUNISHED.? HE CONFESSED THAT IT WAS STILL HARD FOR HIM TO ACCEPT THAT A WOMAN COULD ACCUSE HER HUSBAND OF RAPE. BETWEEN DENYING THE PROBLEM AND USING IT TO FUEL BIGOTED FAR-RIGHT RHETORIC AN APPROACH GROUNDED IN DATA AND A LEVEL HEAD IS VITAL. ANY SOLUTION TO THIS EMERGING ISSUE MUST SIMULTANEOUSLY SEEK TO DENY THE FAR RIGHT THE AMMUNITION IT DESIRES WHILE PRESERVING??NOT RENEGING ON??EUROPE??S HARD EARNED PROGRESSIVE SOCIAL VALUES. WITH THAT IN MIND COLOGNE MAYOR HENRIETTE REKER??S COMMENTS AFTER THE MASS ATTACKS IN HER CITY WERE TERRIBLY UNHELPFUL. WHEN ASKED BY A JOURNALIST HOW WOMEN COULD GUARD AGAINST SUCH ATTACKS REKER SHOCKED MANY AROUND THE WORLD BY SUGGESTING THAT WOMEN SHOULD REMAIN AT ??ARM??S LENGTH? FROM STRANGERS IN THE STREET AND THAT SHE WOULD SOON BE ISSUING A ??CODE OF CONDUCT? FOR WOMEN ??SO THAT SUCH THINGS DO NOT HAPPEN TO THEM.? OTHERS HAVE MADE THE SAME ERROR. MARTIN THALHAMMER THE HEADMASTER AT WILHELM-DIESS-GYMNASIUM A SCHOOL IN POCKING BAVARIA SENT A LETTER HOME TO PARENTS ADVISING THEM THAT ??SYRIAN CITIZENS ARE MAINLY MUSLIMS AND SPEAK ARABIC. THE REFUGEES ARE MARKED BY THEIR OWN CULTURE. BECAUSE OUR SCHOOL IS DIRECTLY NEXT TO WHERE THEY ARE STAYING MODEST CLOTHING SHOULD BE ADHERED TO IN ORDER TO AVOID DISCREPANCIES. REVEALING TOPS OR BLOUSES SHORT SHORTS OR MINISKIRTS COULD LEAD TO MISUNDERSTANDINGS.? WITH MEN ACCOUNTING FOR ABOUT 70 PERCENT OF ASYLUM SEEKERS SOME GROUPS ACROSS GERMANY HAVE DEMANDED GENDER-SEGREGATED ACCOMMODATION AND SAFE ZONES FOR WOMEN. NO. EUROPEAN PROGRESSIVE AND FEMINIST GROUPS HAVE TOILED OVER CENTURIES TO EDUCATE US ALL THAT RAPE VICTIMS ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS OF THE RAPIST. VICTIM-BLAMING AND DEMANDING THAT WOMEN CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR ARE THE WORST WAY TO RESPOND TO RAPE CULTURE. THEY ONLY SEXUALIZE THE VICTIM MORE. THE FETISHIZATION OF THE FEMALE BODY HAS NOT LED TO A DECREASE IN CASES OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN SOCIETIES WHERE WOMEN COVER THEIR ENTIRE BODIES. IF TALIBAN- AND ISIS-HELD AREAS ARE ANYTHING TO GO BY VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ONLY INCREASES THE MORE WOMEN ARE ASKED TO CONCEAL AND SEGREGATE THEMSELVES. THIS WOULD MAKE SENSE BECAUSE ACCOMPANYING SUCH ATTITUDES IS THE NOTION THAT WOMEN ARE SEXUAL OBJECTS TO BE OWNED AND CONTROLLED AND NOT HUMAN BEINGS TO BE RESPECTED AND LOVED. WHAT IS INFURIATING IS THAT FOR CENTURIES PROGRESSIVES HAVE MADE THESE VERY ARGUMENTS AGAINST WHITE CHRISTIAN FUNDAMENTALISTS IN THE WEST YET??DISPLAYING AN INCREDIBLE COGNITIVE DISSONANCE??THOSE PROGRESSIVES EASILY ABANDON THAT POSITION WHEN CONFRONTED WITH THE PROBLEM IN A MINORITY COMMUNITY. THE CASE OF COLOGNE TELLS US THAT WE CAN NO LONGER AFFORD THIS REGRESSIVE-LEFT DOUBLE STANDARD. THE ONLY PERSON TO BLAME FOR RAPE IS THE RAPIST. EMPLOYMENT AND EDUCATION AMONG MIGRANT MALES WILL BE A MORE CONDUCIVE AND FAR MORE CONSISTENT APPROACH THAN ASKING EUROPEAN WOMEN TO CHANGE HOW THEY DRESS OR WHEN THEY GO OUT. NORWAY HAS LED THE WAY HERE OFFERING VOLUNTARY NATIONWIDE CLASSES THAT EXPAND UPON NORWEGIAN SOCIAL AND SEXUAL NORMS TO NEWLY ARRIVED MIGRANT MEN. THE GERMAN BORDER TOWN OF PASSAU IN BAVARIA HAS ALREADY STARTED A SIMILAR PROGRAM FOR MALE REFUGEES WHILE DANISH POLITICIANS AIM TO APPROVE THE SAME MEASURE AFTER A STRING OF ATTACKS IN DENMARK. AMONG OTHER MEASURES IT IS MY VIEW THAT SUCH CLASSES SHOULD BE MANDATORY FOR NEW ARRIVALS ACROSS THE CONTINENT. THESE CLASSES SHOULD FORM PART OF A CITIZENSHIP INTEGRATION AND EMPLOYMENT COURSE BEFORE RESIDENCY PERMITS ARE PROVIDED. IN ANY CASE THEY WOULD HELP REFUGEES COME TO GRIPS WITH THE STRANGE NEW WORLD THEY HAVE JUST FLED TO AND CAN ONLY MAKE THEIR JOB PROSPECTS BETTER. FORMER ISRAELI PRIME MINSTER GOLDA MEIR MAY HAVE DONE AND SAID MANY THINGS PEOPLE DISAGREE WITH BUT ONE OF HER STANCES IS DIFFICULT TO ARGUE WITH. WHEN THERE WAS AN OUTBREAK OF NIGHTTIME ASSAULTS AGAINST WOMEN IN ISRAEL A MINISTER IN THE CABINET SUGGESTED A CURFEW TO KEEP WOMEN IN AFTER DARK. ??BUT IT??S THE MEN WHO ARE ATTACKING THE WOMEN? SHE RETORTED. ??IF THERE??S TO BE A CURFEW LET THE MEN STAY AT HOME NOT THE WOMEN.? THE ALTERNATIVE WOULD BE TO LAY THE SEEDS OF THE VERY SAME CULTURAL ATTITUDES IN EUROPE THAT MANY MIGRANTS HAVE BEEN FLEEING FROM IN COUNTIES LIKE SYRIA AND AFGHANISTAN. THAT WOULD BE SHEER MADNESS. ,220740.0
1285,10361146.0,2016-01-28T05:05:00+00:00,MCCAIN AND TOP DEM WARN PENTAGON: PETRAEUS DEMOTION MAY BE ILLEGAL,SEN. JOHN MCCAIN POWERFUL CHAIRMAN OF THE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE AND FORMER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE IS RIDING TO THE RESCUE OF RETIRED GEN. DAVID PETRAEUS WHO IS FACING A RETROACTIVE DEMOTION THAT MCCAIN SAYS COULD BE ILLEGAL. IN A LETTER TO SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ASH CARTER MCCAIN CITED ??TROUBLING MEDIA REPORTS? THAT CARTER MIGHT STRIP PETRAEUS OF HIS FOURTH STAR A RARE FORM OF DISCIPLINE THAT COULD VIOLATE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW AND MCCAIN ARGUED WOULD BE ??MANIFESTLY UNREASONABLE AND UNFAIR.? THE DAILY BEAST FIRST REPORTED LAST WEEK THAT CARTER WAS CONSIDERING THE ACTION IN LIGHT OF PETRAEUS ADMITTING TO SHARING CLASSIFIED INFORMATION WITH HIS MISTRESS AND BIOGRAPHER PAULA BROADWELL. CARTER IS SAID TO VIEW A DEMOTION AS SENDING A MESSAGE THROUGHOUT THE MILITARY THAT EVEN THE MOST REVERED OFFICERS AREN??T IMMUNE FROM PUNISHMENT FOR THEIR ACTIONS. A SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL TOLD THE DAILY BEAST THAT MCCAIN HAS ALSO POSED QUESTIONS TO THE SECRETARY??S OFFICE ABOUT HOW PETRAEUS??S CASE WAS HANDLED AND WHY THE MILITARY IS CONSIDERING PUNISHING HIM NOW??A YEAR AFTER HE PLEADED GUILTY TO MISHANDLING CLASSIFIED INFORMATION AND NEARLY FOUR-AND-A-HALF YEARS AFTER THE OFFENSE ITSELF. A SPOKESPERSON FOR MCCAIN??S OFFICE DECLINED TO DISCUSS THE MATTER BEYOND WHAT WAS IN MCCAIN AND REED??S PUBLIC LETTER SENT LAST WEEK. ??I??M NOT GOING TO COMMENT ON STAFF CORRESPONDENCE? THE SPOKESPERSON SAID. IN THEIR LETTER MCCAIN AND REED QUESTIONED NOT ONLY WHETHER STRIPPING PETRAEUS OF HIS STAR WAS FAIR BUT IF IT WAS LEGAL. ??IT IS RARE THAT A RETIREMENT GRADE DETERMINATION IS CONDUCTED FOR AN OFFICER PREVIOUSLY RETIRED FROM THE U.S. ARMED FORCES? MCCAIN AND REED WROTE REFERRING TO THE PROCESS BY WHICH THE MILITARY CAN REDUCE AN OFFICER??S RANK EVEN AFTER IT HAS BEEN AWARDED. PETRAEUS RETIRED FROM THE U.S. ARMY IN AUGUST 2011 TO BECOME THE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY. THREE DAYS BEFORE HE SWITCHED CAREERS PETRAEUS GAVE BROADWELL EIGHT NOTEBOOKS HE??D COMPILED THAT CONTAINED HIGHLY CLASSIFIED INFORMATION AND OTHER SECRETS INCLUDING THE IDENTITIES OF COVERT OFFICERS INTELLIGENCE CAPABILITIES QUOTES FROM HIGH-LEVEL MEETINGS OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL AND NOTES ABOUT PETRAEUS??S DISCUSSIONS WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA. THE SENATORS SAID CARTER??S DECISION WAS ??DISCRETIONARY? AND ARGUED THAT ??IT IS WELL ESTABLISHED IN LAW? THAT RANK DETERMINATIONS CAN ONLY BE REOPENED IF THE MILITARY DISCOVERED FRAUD ON THE PART OF THE OFFICER SOME ERROR IN THE DECISION TO AWARD THE RANK IN THE FIRST PLACE OR IF THERE WAS ??NEWLY DISCOVERED EVIDENCE? OF WRONGDOING ??PRESENTED WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME??.? CARTER HAS PUBLICLY SOUGHT TO DISTANCE HIMSELF FROM THE CONTROVERSY SAYING DURING A TRIP TO EUROPE LAST WEEK THAT HE HADN??T YET REACHED A CONCLUSION. DEFENSE OFFICIALS SAID THAT THE DECISION TO DEMOTE PETRAEUS RESTS SOLELY WITH THE SECRETARY. ??MY GUESS IS THE LAWYERS ARE CAREFULLY REVIEWING THIS? ONE OFFICIAL TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. MCCAIN HAS LONG BEEN A DIEHARD SUPPORTER OF PETRAEUS (HE HAS CALLED HIM ONE OF AMERICA??S ??GREATEST GENERALS?) SO HIS DEFENSE NOW IS NOT SURPRISING. BUT THE SENATOR MAY ALSO HAVE MOUNTED AN EFFECTIVE LEGAL ARGUMENT AGAINST DEMOTING PETRAEUS ONE THAT THE RETIRED GENERAL HIMSELF COULD USE. ONE NEEDN??T EVEN LOOK TO ADMINISTRATIVE LAW AS MCCAIN DID. THE ARMY??S OWN REGULATIONS STATE THAT A RANK DETERMINATION CAN BE RE-OPENED AFTER AN OFFICER HAS LEFT MILITARY SERVICE ??IF SUBSTANTIAL NEW EVIDENCE DISCOVERED CONTEMPORANEOUSLY WITH OR WITHIN A SHORT TIME FOLLOWING SEPARATION COULD RESULT IN A LOWER GRADE DETERMINATION.? IN OTHER WORDS THE PENTAGON MAY HAVE WAITED TOO LONG TO TRY TO DEMOTE PETRAEUS. PETRAEUS COMMITTED HIS OFFENSE IN 2011 WHILE HE WAS STILL IN UNIFORM BUT HIS ACTIONS WEREN??T DISCOVERED UNTIL MORE THAN A YEAR AFTER HE LEFT MILITARY SERVICE. AND LEGAL EXPERTS SAID PETRAEUS HAD GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT WHEN HE REACHED A PLEA AGREEMENT WITH FEDERAL PROSECUTORS IN 2015 THE MATTER OF DEMOTION WAS BEHIND HIM. A JUDGE FINED PETRAEUS $100000 AND GAVE HIM TWO YEARS PROBATION. ??NO REASONABLE OBSERVER WOULD CONSIDER THIS FOUR-PLUS YEARS PERIOD AS A SHORT TIME? EUGENE FIDELL WHO TEACHES MILITARY JUSTICE AT YALE LAW SCHOOL TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. ??THE REGULATION BINDS THE GOVERNMENT AND AS I READ IT IT??S TOO LATE TO REOPEN GEN. PETRAEUS??S? RANK DETERMINATION. ANOTHER MILITARY LAW EXPERT REACHED A SIMILAR CONCLUSION. ??REOPENING A MATTER THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN SETTLED??AND DECIDED IN GENERAL PETRAEUS?? FAVOR??SENDS A HARMFUL SIGNAL THROUGHOUT THE RANKS OF SENIOR UNIFORMED LEADERS? BUTCH BRACKNELL A RETIRED MARINE OFFICER AND MILITARY LEGAL ADVISER WROTE ON LAWFARE. BRACKNELL SUGGESTED THAT IN LIGHT OF PETRAEUS?? LONG RECORD OF OTHERWISE UNBLEMISHED SERVICE CARTER SHOULD CONSIDER ??GIVING THE MAN A BREAK.? ??CERTAINLY THERE NEEDS TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR SERIOUS MISCONDUCT AT ALL RANKS OF MILITARY SERVICE? BRACKNELL ARGUED. ??BUT THE UNINTENDED MESSAGE OF THIS EX POST FACTO REDUCTION IN GRADE WOULD BE TO TELL JUNIOR GENERALS AND COLONELS THAT NO MATTER HOW WELL YOU SERVE NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU SACRIFICE IN SERVICE TO OUR NATION THERE IS ALWAYS PERIL THAT SENIOR CIVILIAN LEADERS WILL THROW YOU UNDER A BUS FOR EVEN A MINOR INDISCRETION??AND THAT JEOPARDY NEVER ENDS.? SOME OF PETRAEUS?? FELLOW SOLDIERS AREN??T SO SURE. A NUMBER OF OFFICERS STILL IN UNIFORM PRIVATELY TOLD THE DAILY BEAST THAT DRUDGING UP THE CASE SO MANY YEARS AFTER THE FACT WAS GRATUITOUS ESPECIALLY FOR A COMMANDER WHO ARGUABLY WAS ONE OF HIS GENERATION??S BEST WARTIME COMMANDERS. MANY CREDIT PETRAEUS??S LEADERSHIP IN IRAQ IN 2007 AND 2008 WITH STEMMING YEARS OF INCREASINGLY SECTARIAN VIOLENCE EVENTUALLY ROUTING THE PRECURSOR TO ISIS. OTHERS OFFICERS PARTICULARLY LOWER RANKING ONES SAID THAT THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT MUST TREAT PETRAEUS LIKE ANY OTHER OFFICER. MANY SAID THEY KNOW OF COMRADES WHOSE CAREERS ENDED OVER FAR LESS SERIOUS INFRACTIONS THAN SHARING HIGHLY CLASSIFIED INFORMATION WITH A CIVILIAN. ??I WOULD HAVE BEEN KICKED OUT OF THE ARMY FOR THAT? ONE OFFICER TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. OTHERS SAID THAT IF THEY HAD SHARED CLASSIFIED INFORMATION THEY WOULD CERTAINLY LOSE RANK. THE RULES THEY ARGUED SHOULD APPLY THROUGHOUT THE CHAIN OF COMMAND. PENTAGON OFFICIALS SAID THAT WHILE THEY UNDERSTAND MCCAIN??S CONCERNS THEY ARE LEGALLY ALLOWED TO REVIEW PETRAEUS??S FOUR-STAR STANDING. ??IT??S CERTAINLY A REASONABLE LINE OF QUESTIONING? ONE DEFENSE SAID OF MCCAIN??S COMMENTS. ??BUT THERE IS NOTHING THE DEPARTMENT IS DOING THAT IS ILLEGAL. IT MIGHT BE DISTASTEFUL TO SOME BUT THAT IS WHAT COMES WITH BEING A SENIOR RANKING OFFICER.? ??WITH ADDITIONAL REPORTING BY TIM MAK ,17978.0

THOMAS JEFFERSON WRITES THE DECLARATION. JOHN HANCOCK SIGNS IT. JOHN ADAMS GRUMBLES.

A FULLER STORY WOULD ALSO INCLUDE THE WONDER WOMAN OF THE REVOLUTION CATHARINE MACAULAY. HAILED AS ??THE AMAZON LEADING CHARGE AFTER CHARGE ON BEHALF OF A GREAT NEW CAUSE? THIS BOLD BRITISH THINKER HELPED SHAPE THE ANGLO-AMERICAN LOVE OF LIBERTY THAT FREED US FROM ENGLAND AND LAUNCHED OUR DEMOCRATIC ERA. CATHARINE MACAULAY RELEASED HER EIGHT-VOLUME 3500-PAGE?ŸA HISTORY OF ENGLAND?ŸFROM 1763 THROUGH 1783??CRITICAL YEARS IN AMERICAN LIFE. HER VERSION OF BRITISH HISTORY ALONG WITH HER OTHER WRITINGS CELEBRATED LIBERTY AND MOCKED MONARCHY. HER WORKS REFLECT THE BROADER BLOSSOMING OF REPUBLICAN THOUGHT IN THE 1700S. THIS DEMOCRATIC IDEOLOGY TRIGGERED THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION VALUING THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED OVER THE BRUTE FORCE OF THOSE WHO GOVERN. BORN ON APRIL 2 1731 IN KENT JUST 10 MONTHS BEFORE GEORGE WASHINGTON CATHARINE SAWBRIDGE HAD A CONVENTIONAL ARISTOCRATIC EDUCATION FOR GIRLS??SHE WAS TAUGHT VERY LITTLE. BUT SHE ROAMED FREELY HUNGRILY THROUGH HER FATHER??S LIBRARY. AS THE BIOGRAPHER MARY HAYS WROTE IN 1803?Ÿ??SHE BECAME HER OWN PURVEYOR AND RIOTED IN INTELLECTUAL LUXURY.? MACAULAY WOULD RECALL: ??FROM MY EARLY YOUTH I HAVE READ WITH DELIGHT THOSE HISTORIES WHICH EXHIBIT LIBERTY IN ITS MOST EXALTED STATE THE ANNALS OF THE ROMAN AND THE GREEK REPUBLICS.? WHEN SHE WAS 26 AN OLDER ARISTOCRATIC POET ELIZABETH CARTER SAID MACAULAY WAS ??MORE DEEPLY LEARNED THAN BECOMES A FINE LADY.? MARRIED IN 1760 FOR ONLY SIX YEARS UNTIL THE DEATH OF HER HUSBAND THE SCOTTISH PHYSICIAN GEORGE MACAULAY SHE BECAME A FREE LIVER NOT JUST A FREE THINKER. FOR TWO YEARS SHE AND HER DAUGHTER LIVED WITH THE REV. THOMAS WILSON WHO EVEN BUILT A STATUE EXALTING HER AS CLIO THE GODDESS OF HISTORY. DESPITE THIS TRIBUTE CRITICS NOTE THAT WITH HER FIRST HUSBAND??S MODERATING EDITORIAL HAND GONE HER LANGUAGE BECAME LOOSER HER INTERPRETATION MORE POLITICAL. THE 48-YEAR-OLD MACAULAY??S SOCIAL STANDING IN GREAT BRITAIN SUFFERED IN 1778 AFTER SHE LEFT WILSON AND MARRIED WILLIAM GRAHAM A 21-YEAR-OLD. MACAULAY RESENTED THAT MEN COULD WOMEN MARRY HALF THEIR AGE WHILE SHE WAS SHUNNED. MACAULAY??S SUPPORT FOR THE AMERICAN COLONISTS OPPRESSED BY THE STAMP ACT IN 1775 HAD ALREADY GENERATED CONTROVERSY. MASTERING THE POPULAR POLITICAL MEDIUM IN THIS GOLDEN AGE OF PAMPHLETEERING SHE BECAME BRITAIN??S FIRST FEMALE PAMPHLETEER. THIS FORM OF 18TH-CENTURY PERFORMANCE ART DRAMATIZED AN INDIVIDUAL??S WORLDVIEW. MORE THAN TODAY??S TELEGRAPHIC OP-EDS OR BARBARIC TWEETS THESE SWEEPING STATEMENTS ROOTED EACH AUTHOR??S POLITICAL STANDS IN PHILOSOPHY. A GREAT PAMPHLET??WHICH COULD REACH 100 PAGES??CLEVERLY ARTICULATED BASIC ASSUMPTIONS THAT STILL EXPLAIN WHO WE ARE AS HUMAN BEINGS HOW GOOD SOCIETIES FUNCTION AND WHAT MAKES FOR THE BEST FORM OF GOVERNMENT. THE LIBRARY OF AMERICA RECENTLY PUBLISHED A TWO-VOLUME BOXED SET REVOLUTION: WRITINGS FROM THE PAMPHLET DEBATE 1764-1776?ŸAND MACAULAY??S WORK RANKS WITH THESE GEMS.?ŸSHE INSISTS THAT ??DEFENDING THE CAUSE OF THE AMERICANS? AGAINST BRITISH DESPOTISM IS DEFENDING ??THE RIGHTS OF MANKIND? INCLUDING BRITISH RIGHTS. AS A GOOD REPUBLICAN SHE FEARED THAT TYRANNY ANYWHERE THREATENED LIBERTY EVERYWHERE. THE MINISTERS ??BY ATTACKING THE RIGHTS OF ALL AMERICA? SET DANGEROUS PRECEDENTS FOR ABUSING BRITISH RIGHTS WHILE WEAKENING THE BRITISH EMPIRE. AND SO 241 YEARS AGO IN 1775 IN HER GREAT ??ADDRESS TO THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND IRELAND AND SCOTLAND ON THE PRESENT IMPORTANT CRISIS OF AFFAIRS? SHE?ŸBEGGED: ??ROUSE MY COUNTRYMEN! ROUSE FROM THAT STATE OF GUILTY DISSIPATION IN WHICH YOU HAVE TOO LONG REMAINED AND IN WHICH IF YOU LONGER CONTINUE YOU ARE LOST FOR EVER.? TO MACAULAY THE AMERICAN COLONISTS?? REBELLION ALONG WITH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT??S REACTION VINDICATED HER PREACHING MASQUERADING AS HISTORICAL TEACHING. ??PARLIAMENTS ARE NOXIOUS THINGS WHEN THEY BECOME THE DUPES OF MINISTERS? SHE WARNED. SHE THEREFORE BELIEVED ??IT IS ONLY THE DEMOCRATICAL SYSTEM RIGHTLY BALANCED WHICH CAN SECURE THE VIRTUE LIBERTY AND HAPPINESS OF SOCIETY.? BY 1790 AFTER THE FRENCH REVOLUTION SHE PROCLAIMED: ??GOVERNMENT CAN HAVE NO?ŸLEGITIMATE?ŸFORCE?ŸBUT IN THE?ŸWILL OF THE PEOPLE.? ONE LOCAL CARTOON DEPICTED HER AS A GROTESQUE CROSS BETWEEN AN INDIAN CHIEF AND A ROMAN MATRON TRYING TO STAB BRITANNIA IN THE HEART. IN 1784 SHE MET THE AMERICAN A-LIST PALLING AROUND WITH ABIGAIL AND JOHN ADAMS CHATTING WITH MERCY OTIS WARREN (WHOSE 1805 HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION WAS INSPIRED BY MACAULAY??S WORK) AND SCORING THE ULTIMATE AMERICAN INVITE WITH A 10-DAY VISIT ON GEORGE WASHINGTON??S MOUNT VERNON ESTATE.

TODAY DURING A NASTY ALREADY-TOO-LONG PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN WITH 11 MONTHS LEFT AMID INADEQUATE CANDIDATES AND DAUNTING PROBLEMS WE STILL SHOULD REMEMBER HOW FAR WE HAVE COME POLITICALLY. WE STILL HAVE A DEMOCRACY BASED ON CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED AND A REPUBLIC FORM OF GOVERNMENT THAT CHANNELS THE PEOPLE??S DESIRES THROUGH THEIR REPRESENTATIVES?? ACTIONS. THE TWO MAJOR PARTIES EVOKE THOSE TRADITIONS IN THEIR NAMES. APPRECIATION IS NOT AN EXCUSE TO REST ON OUR LAURELS BUT AN OPPORTUNITY TO RELEARN THE SECRETS OF MUTUALITY THE ARTS OF COMPROMISE THE BONDS OF PATRIOTISM THAT BOTH LEFT AND RIGHT OFTEN FORGET WHILE DEMONIZING ONE ANOTHER. ,10372.0
396,9787497.0,2016-01-10T05:01:00+00:00,SARAH VOWELL??S ROUGH GUIDE TO US HISTORY,THE MONMOUTH BATTLE MONUMENT IN FREEHOLD N.J. INCLUDES FIVE BRONZE BAS-RELIEF SCULPTURES. ONE OF THE PANELS DEPICTS THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE??A FRENCH ARISTOCRAT AND A GENERAL IN GEORGE WASHINGTON??S ARMY??IN A STRATEGY SESSION WITH WASHINGTON JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE OF MONMOUTH DURING THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. WHEN SARAH VOWELL WENT TO SEE THE MONUMENT AS PART OF HER RESEARCH FOR LAFAYETTE IN THE SOMEWHAT UNITED STATES SHE MENTIONS TO A FRIEND THERE THAT A CHARACTER ON ONE OF THE PANELS WAS RUMORED TO HAVE BEEN MODELED ON A YOUNG THOMAS EDISON. HE??S SUPPOSEDLY ONE OF THE SOLDIERS STANDING BEHIND MOLLY PITCHER WHO BROUGHT WATER TO THE SOLDIERS AND ??WHO WAS EITHER AN ACTUAL WOMAN NAMED MARY HAYS OR A TALL TALE OR THE COMPOSITE OF A LOT OF ACTUAL WOMEN INCLUDING ONE NAMED MARY HAYS (OR NOT) AT DIFFERENT BATTLES? VOWELL WRITES. AFTER A DISCURSION ABOUT MOLLY PITCHER??OR MARY HAYS OR WHOEVER??VOWELL NOTES THAT NONE OF THE CHARACTERS DEPICTED IN THE BACKGROUND PARTICULARLY LOOK LIKE THOMAS EDISON. VOWELL??S FRIEND LOOKS UP PICTURES OF EDISON ON HIS PHONE. ??BY THAT I DO NOT MEAN THAT HE CALLS UP EDISON??S PICTURE FROM THE INTERNET? VOWELL WRITES. ??HE HAS AN EDISON PORTRAIT ON HIS PHONE ALREADY IN BETWEEN SNAPSHOTS OF HIS KIDS.? WHICH VOWELL EXPLAINS. LAFAYETTE IN THE SOMEWHAT UNITED STATES IS NOT A BIOGRAPHY OF LAFAYETTE OR A HISTORY OF THE BATTLE OF MONMOUTH OR OF THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR. THE UNDERLYING MATERIAL OF THE BOOK IS CLOSER TO A HISTORY OF LAFAYETTE??S TWO EXTENDED STAYS IN THE UNITED STATES??FIRST AS THE HUNKY ELVIS OF THE REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD AND MANY YEARS LATER AS THE VEGAS ELVIS ON A VALEDICTORY TOUR OF AMERICA IN FULL-ON NOSTALGIA FOR THE GOOD OLD DAYS. THE BOOK ITSELF IS SARAH VOWELL??S EXPLORATION OF ALL OF THIS MATERIAL AND HOW SHE FOUND IT AND WHAT SHE MADE OF IT AND WHY SHE??S WRITING ABOUT IT. IT??S SORT OF A MEMOIR ABOUT RESEARCHING LAFAYETTE IN THE SOMEWHAT UNITED STATES BUT ONLY SORT OF. IF THE BOOK SOUNDS LIKE AN IMPENETRABLE MESS THEN YOU MISUNDERSTAND WHAT??S HAPPENING HERE. LAFAYETTE LIKE VOWELL??S PREVIOUS BOOKS IS BIG SPRAWLING DISCURSIVE ILLUMINATING IMMINENTLY READABLE AND A BESTSELLER. WE CAUGHT UP WITH HER TO TALK ABOUT THE BOOK HER UNUSUAL APPROACH TO HISTORY AND WHY SHE REFERS TO ANTIQUE LAFAYETTE MEMORABILIA AS ??MERCH.? WERE YOU LOOKING FOR A TOPIC WHEN YOU FOUND LAFAYETTE OR DID YOU FIND SOME OTHER ROUTE INTO THIS MATERIAL? I WROTE A SHORT PIECE PROBABLY A DECADE AGO ABOUT LAFAYETTE??S RETURN TRIP TO AMERICA IN 1924 SO HE HAD BEEN ON MY MIND FOR A WHILE. THE THING THAT DREW ME TO THAT STORY INITIALLY WASN??T THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR IT WAS LAFAYETTE COMING BACK TO THE UNITED STATES AS AN OLD MAN AND THE WAY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE EMBRACED HIM WITH WHOOPS AND HOLLERS. HE WAS HERE FOR A YEAR AND ALMOST EVERY NIGHT THERE WAS A PARTY IN HIS HONOR. LAFAYETTE WAS 19 YEARS OLD WHEN HE VOLUNTEERED IN THE CONTINENTAL ARMY SO BY 1824 HE WAS THE LAST LIVING GENERAL FROM THE CONTINENTAL ARMY. IT WAS COMING UP ON THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION AND HIS PRESENCE HERE WHIPPED AMERICAN PEOPLE INTO THIS FRENZY OF AFFECTION. WE??RE NOT A COUNTRY KNOWN FOR OUR AGREEMENT OR OUR MUTUAL AFFECTION SO THOSE ROSY ASPECTS OF HIS STORY APPEALED TO ME. EVERY OTHER ASPECT OF THE STORY WAS GOOD OLD FASHIONED AMERICAN RANCOR AND INABILITY TO COME TO ANY KIND OF CONSENSUS. HE WAS A LOT YOUNGER THAN THE PEOPLE WE CONSIDER TO BE HIS REVOLUTIONARY CONTEMPORARIES. PART OF LAFAYETTE??S APPEAL WAS HIS YOUTH. I MAKE AN ALLUSION IN THE BOOK TO YOUNG ELVIS AND MIDDLE-AGED ELVIS. LAFAYETTE WAS THIS TEENAGER IN THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION AND WHEN HE COMES BACK HERE HE??S ELDERLY. THERE??S A CERTAIN FAST-FORWARD/REWIND ASPECT TO LAFAYETTE??S STORY. HE HAD TRAINED WITH THE FRENCH ARMY AND GONE TO RIDING SCHOOL WITH FUTURE KINGS. HE HAD MORE EXPERIENCE AT 19 THAN MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE FIGHTING WITH WASHINGTON. LAFAYETTE??S ENTHUSIASM PROBABLY HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH HIS YOUTH AND SOME OF HIS EFFECTIVENESS WAS BOUND UP IN A YOUNG BOY??S QUEST FOR GLORY. THAT SEEMS SOMEWHAT RIDICULOUS TO ME BUT THE PRACTICAL EFFECT WAS THAT??BECAUSE HE WANTED FAME AND GLORY ON THE BATTLEFIELD??HE WAS TIRELESS ON THE BATTLEFIELD. MEANWHILE REGULARS IN WASHINGTON??S ARMY WERE DESERTING IN DROVES. YOU WROTE A LOT ABOUT HOW MANY MORE PEOPLE CAME TO SEE LAFAYETTE??S ARRIVAL IN NEW YORK THAN WHEN THE BEATLES CAME TO NEW YORK IN 1964. THAT WAS NOSTALGIA FOR THE FOUNDING FATHERS RIGHT? YES. THAT WAS THE FIRST REAL NATIONWIDE ITERATION OF PATRIOTIC NOSTALGIA FOR THE FOUNDERS. I WAS A LITTLE KID DURING THE BICENTENNIAL IN 1976 AND I REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO BE CAUGHT UP IN THAT. PART OF IT WAS SENTIMENT THAT WASHINGTON THE GENERALS THE FOUNDERS WERE MOSTLY DEAD. I THINK IT WAS ALSO THAT 1824 WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT AMERICANS WERE GOING TO HAVE TO ELECT A PRESIDENT WHO WASN??T ONE OF THE FOUNDING FATHERS AND IT WAS A VERY FRACTURED CAMPAIGN. SO SOME OF IT WAS SENTIMENT BUT SOME OF IT WAS FEAR OF NOW WHAT? YOU USE A LOT OF CONTEMPORARY LANGUAGE AND ANALOGIES IN THE BOOK??LIKE CALLING LAFAYETTE MEMORABILIA ??MERCH???THAT YOU DON??T SEE A LOT IN HISTORY WRITING. I KIND OF FEEL LIKE I??M NOT EATING MY SPINACH. I??M ALIVE RIGHT NOW SO I WRITE AND TALK LIKE SOMEONE WHO IS ALIVE RIGHT NOW. AND SOME OF IT IS RHYTHMIC????MERCH? IS JUST A STRONGER WORD AND A STRONGER WAY TO END A SENTENCE THAN ??MERCHANDISE.? ??SOUVENIRS? SEEMS TOO GENERAL. ??MERCH? HAS THE CONNOTATION OF CRASS COMMERCIALISM AND IT WOULD BE UNTRUE TO TALK ABOUT LAFAYETTE??S RETURN TRIP AS A PURELY SENTIMENTAL EXERCISE. PEOPLE MADE A PROFIT OFF OF HIS IMAGE. I??M WRITING AS A MEMBER OF MY CULTURE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND MY CULTURE. WHEN I MENTION SOMEONE LIVE ELVIS PEOPLE CALL THAT POP CULTURE. TO ME THAT??S JUST AMERICAN CULTURE. IT??S ALL JUST CULTURE TO ME. I DON??T REALLY MAKE DISTINCTIONS. I??M PROBABLY ACTUALLY LESS COLLOQUIAL THAN I USED TO BE. I DON??T THINK OF IT AS COLLOQUIAL AS MUCH PART OF THE FORM OF WHAT YOU??RE DOING. I??M VERY AWARE AS I READ THE BOOK THAT MOST OTHER POPULAR HISTORIANS OPERATE FROM A CONCEIT THAT THEY??RE WRITING A CINEMATIC NOVELIZATION WITH REAL FACTS. THAT??S NOT WHAT YOU DO WHICH IS MORE LIKE A MEMOIR OF YOUR INQUIRY INTO THE MATERIAL. MY BOOKS WILL NEVER BE TURNED INTO FILMS PROBABLY BECAUSE I DON??T START OUT FROM A LOFTY PLACE OF EXPERTISE. I DON??T THINK CINEMATICALLY. MY BOOKS ARE BOOKY BOOKS AND A LOT OF THE DETOURS AND ANALYSES ARE SOMETHING THAT CAN ONLY HAPPEN IN A BOOK. I LEARN AS I GO AND THE READER LEARNS WITH ME. A LOT OF WHAT I DO IS ANALYSIS OF WHAT??S HAPPENING??LIKE IN THE BEGINNING WHEN I??M TRYING TO SET UP THE VARIOUS THEMES OF THE BOOK. ONE OF THEM IS THAT AMERICAN PATRIOTS COULD NOT HAVE WON THE WAR WITHOUT THE HELP OF THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT WHICH WAS THE GOVERNMENT OF AN ABSOLUTE MONARCH. THE FOUNDING FATHERS WERE STICKLERS ABOUT TAXATION IN GENERAL BUT THEY WERE OPEN-MINDED ABOUT TAKING MONEY FROM A FRENCH KING WHO WAS TAXING HIS SUBJECTS. YOU COULD SEE THAT AS A HUMOROUS ASIDE BUT I??M SAYING RIGHT UP FRONT THAT THERE??S A CERTAIN HYPOCRISY ABOUT THAT AND I COMMENT ON IT IN A PRETTY BLUNT WAY. MY PURPOSE IS TO BE VERY CLEAR AND TRUTHFUL ABOUT THE SITUATION. ACCEPTING MONEY FROM THIS GOVERNMENT THAT??S WAY MORE PUNITIVE IN THE WAY IT TAXES ITS PEOPLE THAN THE MONARCH OF GREAT BRITAIN WAS REALLY MESSY AND DOESN??T LEND ITSELF TO A TWO-HOUR BIOPIC. A LOT OF THAT NOSTALGIA WAS FOR GEORGE WASHINGTON IN PARTICULAR. THE FOUNDERS ARE TREATED TODAY WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF REFERENCE. AND FOR GOOD REASON??WHAT THEY ACCOMPLISHED WAS INSURMOUNTABLE AND UNPRECEDENTED??BUT THEY??RE STILL PEOPLE. ONE OF THE THINGS I ALWAYS COME BACK TO IS: THIS IS A PERSON. GEORGE WASHINGTON IS A PERSON. THE FARTHER BACK YOU GO PEOPLE BECOME ALMOST LIKE BIBLICAL FIGURES??LIKE SOMEONE WHO EXISTS BUT IN A MYTHIC REALM. PART OF MY BOOK IS ABOUT THE SLOG OF THIS WAR WHICH LASTS NEARLY 20 YEARS. THERE WAS A CERTAIN PERSEVERANCE REQUIRED OF WASHINGTON. HE THREATENS TO QUIT AT ONE POINT BECAUSE THERE ARE CONSPIRACIES TO GET RID OF HIM AND THE FACT THAT HE STICKS WITH IT IS ONE OF THE DECIDING FACTORS OF THE WAR. HOW DID YOU FIGURE THAT OUT THAT IT WAS OK TO GO YOUR OWN WAY WHEN OTHER POPULAR HISTORIANS??NATHANIEL PHILBRICK ROBERT CARO DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN??ARE WRITING WHAT ARE ESSENTIALLY REGARDED AS NOVELS? ONE THING I COME BACK TO A LOT IS THAT I HAD AN INCREDIBLY PROTESTANT UPBRINGING OF THE OLD-TIME-RELIGION SORT. I WAS BROUGHT UP TO BELIEVE THAT ALL HUMAN BEINGS ARE INHERENTLY DEPRAVED AND EVIL BUT THE DEMOCRATIC FLIPSIDE OF THAT IS GROWING UP BELIEVING THAT NO ONE IS BETTER OR WORSE THAN ME. IT??S NOT A PARTICULARLY CHEERFUL WAY TO GROW UP BUT IN THE LONG RUN IT MADE ME A MORE CONFIDENT SELF-CONTAINED PERSON. SOME OF THE WAY I WRITE ABOUT HISTORY CAME FROM WHEN I STARTED WRITING. THE FIRST TIME I WROTE A DISTINCT PIECE ABOUT AN EVENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY WAS ABOUT THE TRAIL OF TEARS FOR A RADIO DOCUMENTARY. SOME OF THE BOOKS IN THE RESEARCH WERE NOT PLEASURABLE TO READ AND READING HAS BEEN ONE OF THE JOYS OF MY LIFE SINCE I WAS A LITTLE KID. A LOT OF WHAT I READ WASN??T CLEAR OR WAS TOO SIMPLISTIC. I NEVER FOUND ONE VERSION OF THAT STORY THAT WAS CLEAR AND SOPHISTICATED AND FUN TO READ. SOME OF THE WAY I WRITE NOW COMES FROM INTERACTING WITH READERS. A LOT OF THE DETOURS THAT MAKE MY WRITING CIRCUITOUS COMES FROM GIVING CONTEXT. THERE ARE TANGENTS IN THE BOOK WHERE I??M TRYING TO EXPLAIN WHAT??S GOING ON WITH THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR. THAT COMES FROM READERS TELLING ME THAT THEY DON??T READ OTHER HISTORY BOOKS. MAYBE READERS HAVEN??T CONSIDERED THAT IT WASN??T JUST COLONISTS VS. KINGS. SOMETIMES IT WAS COLONISTS VS. COLONISTS. THE BOOK IS FUNNY IN A LOT OF PLACES. DO YOU WRITE SOMEWHAT AS A HUMORIST? I LIKE TO THINK I??M NOT A TOTAL DRAG. MY BOOKS ARE WRITTEN BY A PERSON AND PEOPLE GO THROUGH VARIOUS EMOTIONAL STATES. HUMOR IS NOT MY PURPOSE. IT??S PART OF WHO I AM BUT SO IS THINKING ABOUT THE MANAGEMENT OF THE CONTINENTAL ARMY??S SUPPLY SYSTEM. SOMETIMES I JOKE AROUND SOMETIMES I??M INCREDIBLY HORRIFIED SOMETIMES I??M THINKING THINGS THROUGH SOMETIMES I??M TELLING A VERY ANECDOTAL STORY SOMETIMES I??M MAKING A POINT. IT??S JUST PART OF BEING A PERSON. I WORKED FOR A WEEK ONCE AT THE DAILY SHOW. I LIKED THOSE PEOPLE. I LIKE WHAT THEY DO AND I ADMIRE IT BUT EVERYTHING WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FUNNY??WHICH IS THE POINT OF A COMEDY SHOW ON A COMEDY CHANNEL??BUT THAT WAS JUST NOT APPEALING TO ME. THERE??S SOME PRETTY DARK STUFF IN AMERICAN HISTORY. IT??S NOT ALL DARK BUT A LOT OF IT IS. SOME OF THE HUMOR IS JUST TRYING TO DEAL WITH THAT DARKNESS. YOU HAD SOME PEOPLE READING IN THE AUDIOBOOK WHO ARE KNOWN FOR BEING FUNNY BUT WHO DON??T COME ACROSS AS HAMMY OR IRONIC. THAT WAS ON PURPOSE RIGHT? BEING A COMEDIC ACTOR REQUIRES A CERTAIN INTELLIGENCE. NICK OFFERMAN IS GEORGE WASHINGTON WHO WAS NOT A PARTICULARLY FUNNY PERSON. OFFERMAN??AS A WRITER HIMSELF AND AS A PERSON??HAS A CERTAIN GRAVITAS. HE??S PUNCTUAL. HE??S TRUSTWORTHY. HE HAS THIS AUTHORITY. AND HE??S ALSO A WONDERFUL ACTOR. HAVING HIM READ GEORGE WASHINGTON WAS A NO-BRAINER. JOHN HODGMAN HAS AN UNWAVERING INTELLIGENCE LIKE JOHN ADAMS BUT ALSO A HOTHEAD QUALITY. HE??S GOOD AT BEING MIFFED. SOME OF THESE PEOPLE ARE FUNNY IN THEIR REGULAR WORK BUT THEY HAVE THESE OTHER QUALITIES. JOHN SLATTERY IS A REALLY GOOD ACTOR AND HE??S A HILARIOUS PERSON. I LIKE WORKING ON THE AUDIOBOOKS BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE WHAT PEOPLE ARE CAPABLE OF DOING. HOW DID YOU PUT TOGETHER THE AUDIOBOOK CAST? MOSTLY IT??S PEOPLE I KNOW FROM BEING AROUND. I HAVE KNOWN FRED ARMISEN SINCE I WAS IN SCHOOL IN CHICAGO AND HE WAS THE DRUMMER FOR SOME WEIRD BAND. HE??S A FASCINATING PERSON TO WORK WITH. BEFORE HE READS THE PART HE WRITES A LITTLE PLAY IN HIS HEAD OF WHAT THE PERSON IS TALKING ABOUT. HE WAS DOING WILHELM VON STEUBEN THE GERMAN GENERAL AND TO GET HIMSELF INTO THAT CHARACTER HE WAS TALKING IN A GERMAN ACCENT??LIKE A GERMAN ROCKER TALKING ABOUT HIS DAY??AND THEN HE WOULD DO THE SCENE. TO ME THE SLEEPER HIT OF THE AUDIOBOOK IS ALEXIS DENISOF WHO WAS ON BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER. HE TRAINED AT THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF DRAMATIC ARTS AND DID JUST ABOUT ALL OF THE BRITISH. HE DID RESEARCH ON ALL THE PARTS AND WOULD SAY LIKE ??THIS GUY IS FROM SUSSEX AND THIS IS HOW THEY SPEAK.? HE CAME AT IT FROM THIS VERY SCHOLARLY SHAKESPEAREAN PLACE. WHAT HAVE YOU READ THIS YEAR? I??VE BEEN ON A JAPANESE AESTHETICS KICK. I READ A BOOK THAT THE ARCHITECT ARATA ISOZAKI WROTE CALLED JAPAN-NESS IN ARCHITECTURE. I GO ON LITTLE RESEARCH-READING KICKS FOR MY OWN ENJOYMENT AND I HAPPEN TO ENJOY JAPANESE CULTURE. I ALSO READ DETECTIVE NOVELS. THERE??S A WRITER NAMED ATTICA LOCKE ON THE SHOW EMPIRE WHO ALSO WRITES GREAT CRIME NOVELS. SHE WROTE PLEASANTVILLE WHICH INVOLVES A DEAD GIRL AND A POLITICAL FAMILY IN THIS TRADITIONALLY BLACK NEIGHBORHOOD IN HOUSTON. AND I RECENTLY READ THE BLOODY BOZEMAN BY DOROTHY M. JOHNSON WHICH IS ABOUT MONTANA DURING THE CIVIL WAR. HAVE YOU STARTED ON ANOTHER PROJECT? NO. I USUALLY HAVE KIND OF A MENTAL HANGOVER AFTER I FINISH A BOOK. THEY READ SORT OF BREEZILY??AT LEAST I HOPE THEY DO??BUT THERE??S A LOT OF INFORMATION ON EVERY PAGE. CORRALING ALL OF THAT INTO A STRUCTURE REALLY TAKES A LOT OUT OF ME. ,12143.0

THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE (IOC) WHICH PREVIOUSLY REQUIRED TRANSGENDER ATHLETES TO UNDERGO GENDER-REASSIGNMENT SURGERY IN ORDER TO COMPETE IS NOW EXPECTED TO RECOGNIZE THAT DISTINCTION BY ALLOWING ALL TRANSGENDER MEN TO COMPETE IN THE MALE CATEGORY ??WITHOUT RESTRICTION? AND ALLOWING TRANSGENDER WOMEN TO COMPETE IN THE FEMALE CATEGORY AFTER A YEAR OF HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY (HRT). THE NEW RECOMMENDED GUIDELINES OBTAINED BY OUTSPORTS WERE DEVELOPED DURING A MEETING HELD LAST NOVEMBER. THEY ARE EXPECTED TO BE ADOPTED BY THE IOC BEFORE THE SUMMER OLYMPICS IN RIO DE JANEIRO. FOR TRANSGENDER ENDURANCE ATHLETE CHRIS MOSIER THE POLICY CHANGE WON??T SEND HIM TO RIO BUT IT SHOULD ALLOW HIM TO BE ON TEAM USA IN SPAIN THIS SUMMER. MOSIER A TRANSGENDER MAN WHO WAS FEATURED BY ESPN LAST OCTOBER QUALIFIED FOR COMPETITION IN THE SPRINT DUATHLON AT THE 2016 WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP THIS SUMMER BUT WAS UNCERTAIN WHETHER OR NOT HE WOULD BE ALLOWED TO COMPETE BECAUSE HE HAS NOT COMPLETED THE REQUIRED GENDER REASSIGNMENT SURGERY AS OUTSPORTS REPORTED EARLIER THIS MONTH. ??ASSUMING I GET APPROVAL FROM THE INTERNATIONAL TRIATHLON UNION AND THEY FOLLOW THE NEW IOC POLICY I WILL NOW BE ABLE TO COMPETE IN THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP IN SPAIN IN JUNE AS PART OF TEAM USA? MOSIER TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. MOSIER CURRENTLY SERVES AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF GO! ATHLETES A SUPPORT NETWORK FOR LGBTQ ATHLETES. TO DATE NO OPENLY TRANSGENDER ATHLETE HAS COMPETED IN THE OLYMPICS BUT MOSIER IS HOPEFUL THAT THIS POLICY PROVES HISTORIC IN THE COMING YEARS. ??THIS OPENS THE DOORS FOR EVERYONE ELSE? HE TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. ??SOMEWHERE THERE IS A YOUNG PERSON JUST GETTING STARTED IN SPORT WHO CAN NOW LIVE AUTHENTICALLY AS THEIR TRUE SELF AND BE ABLE TO SOMEDAY COMPETE FOR OLYMPIC GOLD WITHOUT COMPROMISING PART OF THEIR IDENTITY AS AN ATHLETE OR AS A PERSON. THAT??S AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERYONE WHO WAS LIMITED BY THE OUTDATED REGULATIONS AND I THINK IT WILL HAVE A TRICKLE DOWN EFFECT TO OTHER ORGANIZATIONS WHICH WILL IMPROVE THE LANDSCAPE OF SPORTS FOR OTHER TRANS ATHLETES.? FOR TRANSGENDER ATHLETES THIS POLICY SHIFT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME COMING. IN 2003 THE IOC ARRIVED AT THE STOCKHOLM CONSENSUS ON SEX REASSIGNMENT IN SPORTS WHICH OPENED THE DOOR FOR TRANSGENDER COMPETITORS PROVIDED THEY MET THREE SPECIFIC CONDITIONS: HRT FOR A ??SUFFICIENT LENGTH OF TIME TO MINIMIZE GENDER-RELATED ADVANTAGES IN SPORT COMPETITIONS? LEGAL RECOGNITION OF THEIR GENDER AND ??SURGICAL ANATOMICAL CHANGES? INCLUDING ??EXTERNAL GENITALIA CHANGES AND GONADECTOMY.? THIS FINAL CONDITION WAS AN ESPECIALLY HIGH HURDLE FOR TRANS ATHLETES TO CLEAR. HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY AND CHANGES TO LEGAL DOCUMENTS ARE OFTEN THE FIRST STEPS IN A GENDER TRANSITION. BUT SURGERY IF DESIRED CAN BE PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE AND IS OFTEN NOT COVERED BY PRIVATE INSURERS. THE LOGIC BEHIND REQUIRING SURGERY FOR A SPORTING EVENT WAS ALSO FUZZY: ALTHOUGH THE TESTES PRODUCE TESTOSTERONE TRANSGENDER WOMEN UNDERGOING HRT ARE PRESCRIBED SPIRONOLACTONE A DIURETIC THAT ALSO BLOCKS ANDROGEN RECEPTORS REDUCING TESTOSTERONE LEVELS TO A NORMAL FEMALE RANGE AND ALTERING MUSCLE MASS. SIMILARLY TRANSGENDER MEN SIMPLY TAKE TESTOSTERONE WITH NO SURGERY REQUIRED TO MOVE THEIR BLOOD LEVELS INTO A NORMAL MALE RANGE. IN SPITE OF THIS THE STOCKHOLM CONSENSUS WHICH WAS ADOPTED BY THE IOC IN 2004 REQUIRED TRANSGENDER OLYMPIC HOPEFULS TO WAIT ??TWO YEARS AFTER GONADECTOMY [REMOVAL OF THE GONADS]? TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR COMPETITION. FOLLOWING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2004 POLICY KRISTEN WORLEY A TRANSGENDER CYCLIST WHO HAD UNDERGONE GENDER REASSIGNMENT SURGERY AND OTHERWISE MET THE STOCKHOLM REQUIREMENTS FAILED TO MEET QUALIFYING TIMES IN OFFICIAL EVENTS LEADING UP TO THE BEIJING SUMMER GAMES IN 2008. SO FAR WORLEY IS THE MOST NOTABLE OPENLY TRANSGENDER ATHLETE TO MAKE A BID FOR OLYMPIC ELIGIBILITY. NOW THAT THE REQUIREMENTS ARE LESS STRINGENT HER STORY MAY NOT BE SO SINGULAR. JOANNA HARPER A CHIEF MEDICAL PHYSICIST HERSELF TRANSGENDER TOLD OUTSPORTS THAT SHE WAS PRESENT AT THE NOVEMBER MEETING IN WHICH THESE PREVIOUS REQUIREMENTS WERE DISCUSSED. SHE IS PLEASED WITH THE PROPOSED CHANGES WHICH CLOSELY RESEMBLE NEW GUIDELINES THE NCAA ADOPTED IN 2011. ??THE WAITING PERIOD FOR TRANS WOMEN GOES FROM TWO YEARS AFTER SURGERY TO ONE YEAR AFTER THE START OF HRT? HARPER SAID. ??THIS MATCHES UP WITH THE NCAA RULES AND IS AS GOOD AS ANYTHING. THE WAITING PERIOD WAS PERHAPS THE MOST CONTENTIOUS ITEM AMONG OUR GROUP AND ONE YEAR IS A REASONABLE COMPROMISE.? HARPER INCIDENTALLY IS ALSO AN ACCOMPLISHED CROSS-COUNTRY RUNNER. IN A 2014 INTERVIEW WITH THE WASHINGTON POST SHE DISCUSSED FIRSTHAND THE EFFECTS OF SPIRONOLACTONE ON HER TIMES: ??I FELT THE SAME WHEN I RAN. I JUST COULDN??T GO AS FAST.? THERE IS MORE THAN JUST ANECDOTAL DATA OF COURSE TO SUPPORT THE ONE-YEAR HRT REQUIREMENT. A 2010 REPORT CO-SPONSORED BY THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR LESBIAN RIGHTS (NCLR) THE WOMEN??S SPORTS FOUNDATION AND THE IT TAKES A TEAM! CAMPAIGN NOTED THAT ??ANY ATHLETIC ADVANTAGES A TRANSGENDER GIRL OR WOMAN ARGUABLY MAY HAVE AS A RESULT OF HER PRIOR TESTOSTERONE LEVELS DISSIPATE AFTER ABOUT ONE YEAR OF ESTROGEN THERAPY.? ONE 2008 SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE REVIEW CITED IN THE REPORT NOTED THAT ??THE DATA AVAILABLE DOES NOT APPEAR TO SUGGEST THAT TRANSITIONED ATHLETES WOULD COMPETE AT AN ADVANTAGE OR DISADVANTAGE AS COMPARED WITH [NON-TRANSGENDER] MEN AND WOMEN.? THE PROPOSED IOC POLICY RECOMMENDS MONITORING OF TRANSGENDER WOMEN??S TESTOSTERONE LEVELS FOR 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO COMPETITION AND THROUGHOUT ELIGIBILITY AS WELL. NOW AN OPENLY TRANSGENDER ATHLETE IN THE OLYMPIC GAMES COULD COME SOONER THAN ANTICIPATED. CAITLYN JENNER IS RETROACTIVELY A TRANSGENDER OLYMPIAN BUT 40 YEARS AFTER HER DECATHLON WIN THE DOORS ARE FINALLY WIDE OPEN FOR ATHLETES TO COMPETE AFTER TRANSITION RATHER THAN BEFORE.

FBI SPOKESWOMAN JILLIAN STICKELS TOLD THE DAILY BEAST THAT THERE IS NO RECORD OF AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE COUNCIL OF CONSERVATIVE CITIZENS. THIS COMES AFTER THE DAILY BEAST REQUESTED FBI FILES ON THE GROUP THROUGH THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT. THE FBI DID NOT RESPOND TO REQUESTS FOR FILES ON THE CCC??S MOST PROMINENT LEADERS. THE FOIA REQUEST ALSO COVERED ONE WEEK FOLLOWING THE JUNE 17 2015 ATTACK INDICATING THAT THE FBI WASN??T LOOKING INTO THE GROUP EVEN AFTER IT WAS REVEALED THAT ROOF CITED THE CCC IN HIS MANIFESTO. ROOF WROTE THAT HE GOOGLED ??BLACK ON WHITE CRIME? AND FOUND THEM. ??THE FIRST WEBSITE I CAME TO WAS THE COUNCIL OF CONSERVATIVE CITIZENS. THERE WERE PAGES UPON PAGES OF THESE BRUTAL BLACK ON WHITE MURDERS? ROOF SAID ADDING THAT MORE RESEARCH LED HIM TO ??FIGHT? A RACE WAR. AFTER THE CHARLESTON SHOOTING THE CCC??S WEBMASTER FIRST SAID THE FBI WAS LOOKING INTO SUSPECTED TIES BETWEEN HIM AND ROOF AND THEN LATER DENIED BEING PART OF ANY INVESTIGATION. THE COUNCIL OF CONSERVATIVE CITIZENS WAS FOUNDED IN 1985. IT WAS MEANT TO BE A SUCCESSOR TO THE WHITE CITIZENS COUNCILS FORMED TO OPPOSE DESEGREGATION FOLLOWING THE SUPREME COURT??S 1954 BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION. (JUSTICE THURGOOD MARSHALL CALLED THE COUNCILS THE ??UPTOWN KLAN.?) THE FBI MAINTAINED EXTENSIVE RECORDS ON THE EARLIER CITIZENS?? COUNCILS PARTICULARLY IN THE ??50S AND ??60S. BUT THE PRACTICE APPARENTLY DID NOT CONTINUE DESPITE INFLAMMATORY STATEMENTS FROM THE NEW CCC. IN THE 1980S THE CCC CALLED BLACKS ??GENETICALLY INFERIOR.? IN 2001 THE CCC WEBSITE SAID ??GOD IS THE AUTHOR OF RACISM. GOD IS THE ONE WHO DIVIDED MANKIND INTO DIFFERENT TYPES. MIXING THE RACES IS REBELLIOUSNESS AGAINST GOD.? RACIST STATEMENTS DON??T AUTOMATICALLY TRIGGER AN FBI INVESTIGATION OF COURSE. WHAT??S USUALLY NEEDED IS A LINK TO A THREAT OF VIOLENCE OR CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. RECENT PROSECUTIONS OF ISIS MEMBERS SHOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT MAY INVESTIGATE AND PROSECUTE PEOPLE FOR AS LITTLE AS RE-BLOGGING AN IMAGE THAT CALLS FOR VIOLENCE. OTHER HATE GROUPS HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED BY THE FBI ACCORDING TO THE SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER INCLUDING THE ARYAN NATIONS THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE AND SEVERAL NEO-NAZI GROUPS. THE DIRECTOR OF THE SPLC??S INTELLIGENCE PROJECT SPECULATED THE CCC WAS NOT EXTREME ENOUGH TO WORRY THE FBI. ??IT MAY BE THAT THEY CONSIDERED THE COUNCIL TO BE TOO MAINSTREAM TO INVESTIGATE? HEIDI BEIRICH SAID. ??AFTER ALL SEVERAL GOP LAWMAKERS INCLUDING TRENT LOTT WERE VERY CLOSE TO THE GROUP IN THE 1990S.? THE CCC WAS CO-FOUNDED BY TWO DEMOCRATS FORMER GEORGIA GOVERNOR LESTER MADDOX AND FORMER LOUISIANA CONGRESSMAN JOHN RARICK. REPUBLICAN SENATOR TRENT LOTT SPOKE TO THE CCC AT LEAST FIVE TIMES AS DID REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN BOB BARR IN 1998. MIKE HUCKABEE ANOTHER REPUBLICAN DELIVERED A VIDEOTAPED SPEECH TO THE GROUP IN 1993 WHEN HE RAN FOR GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS. EVEN AS RECENTLY AS 2013 SOUTH CAROLINA??S REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR NIKKI HALEY APPOINTED A CCC LEADER TO HER BEFORE HE RESIGNED WHEN THE PUBLIC FOUND OUT HE WAS WITH THE HATE GROUP. ,6000.0

IT OFFERED THE COMFORT OF SUCH TIRED CLICH??S AS ??PICASSO IS STILL AND ALWAYS THE GREAT ARTIST-HERO.? WORSE? THE SHOW??S LAME PROOF WAS ALL THE GREAT??AND ALMOST ENTIRELY MALE??ARTISTS HE INFLUENCED: BASELITZ BASQUIAT BEUYS HOCKNEY JOHNS LICHTENSTEIN MIR?? OLDENBURG SCHNABEL STELLA TINGUELY WARHOL. BLAH BLAH BLAH. THANKFULLY ??PICASSO SCULPTURE? AT NEW YORK??S MUSEUM OF MODERN ART IS JUST THE OPPOSITE. HERE IS A SENSUAL INTELLECTUAL AND FUNNY BONE-TICKLING EXHIBITION. THIS IS A SHOW THAT NEVER LEAVES YOU DAZED AND DYING FOR THE CAF??. YOU RAMBLE YOU FROLIC YOU FANTASIZE AND YOU LAUGH OUTRIGHT THROUGH SPACIOUS WHITEWASHED ROOMS OF GORGEOUS SOMETIMES TROUBLING EVER SEDUCTIVE OBJECTS YOU CANNOT TEAR YOUR EYES FROM. THE EXHIBITION ILLUMINATES THE PICASSO WHO WAS ENDLESSLY UP-FOR-FUN AND ADVENTURE RIDING THE HOT RAILS OF HIS FEROCIOUS CURIOSITY BOWING TO THE LURE OF THE EROTIC. ALWAYS WANTING TO TOUCH EVERYTHING. HOW DOES HE DO IT? OR MORE TO THE POINT WHY DID HE DO IT? THE MAN WAS A PAINTER AFTER ALL A PAINTER PAR EXCELLENCE. BEFORE OR AFTER MICHELANGELO WHEN WAS THERE EVER A PAINTER WHO ABANDONED HIMSELF SO WHOLEHEARTEDLY TO SCULPTURE? IF THAT SOUNDS LIKE HERO WORSHIP I PREFER TO THINK OF IT AS ADMIRATION. BY THE AGE OF 19 IN 1910 PICASSO HAD ALREADY ROBBED HIS PAINTER FATHER OF HIS PROFESSIONAL IDENTITY WHICH THE FATHER ALLEGEDLY HANDED THE SON SIX YEARS EARLIER. THE YOUNG ARTIST CONCOCTED PARIS SCENES A LA TOULOUSE-LAUTREC LANDSCAPES WITH LATE C??ZANNE IN MIND CAF?? TERRACES VAN GOGH-STYLE. LATER HIS WORK CONVERSED WITH BRAQUE MATISSE L??GER. MUCH LATER IT WAS MANET DELACROIX AND VEL?­ZQUEZ. STYLISTICALLY HE JUGGLED AND PARTIED WITH ASTONISHING PANACHE AND CONFIDENCE. HIS CHUMS ON THE VOYAGE WERE PAINTERS DEEPLY INVENTIVE PAINTERS. SO THE OBVIOUS QUESTION IS: WHY SCULPTURE AT ALL FOR THIS VIRTUOSO PAINTER? IN FACT SCULPTURE WASN??T REALLY OF MUCH INTEREST TO MANY PEOPLE. IT??S SUCH A PALPABLE FORM OF ARTISTIC EXPRESSION THAT THERE??S RELATIVELY LITTLE TO IMAGINE TO CONJURE UP TO BRING TO LIFE. TO BE A GREAT ARTIST YOU HAD TO BE A PAINTER. YET PICASSO KEPT REACHING FOR SCULPTURE NOT CONSISTENTLY THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE BUT AT PARTICULAR MOMENTS AND WITH GREAT INTELLECTUAL AND PHYSICAL VITALITY. IT??S ALMOST AS IF HE NEEDED TO MAKE AN OBJECT IN THREE DIMENSIONS??SOMETHING PALPABLE TO FIGURE OUT THE ??REAL.? WHETHER IT WAS THE PHYSICAL PSYCHOLOGICAL OR SEXUAL ??REAL? SCULPTURE ACTED AS PICASSO??S LABORATORY FOR THAT INVESTIGATION. IN THE NARRATIVE PROPOSED BY MOMA??S STARTLING AND CHARMING SHOW PICASSO??S SCULPTURAL QUEST STARTS WITH AN URGE TOWARDS PULLING A FIGURE OUT OF MOLTEN INCHOATE MATERIAL RISING UP FROM A MIASMA OF EMOTIONS. IN EARLY WORKS LIKE SEATED WOMAN (1902) HEAD (1907) FIGURE (1907) THE SUBJECTS HALF-BURIED IN STONE OR WOOD PUSH FORWARD LIKE MICHELANGELO AND RODIN??S DID. BUT IN PICASSO THERE??S MORE OF A SENSE OF COMING OUT OF A TOTEMIC PAST??THE OBVIOUS DEBTS TO AFRICAN AND OCEANIC SCULPTURE??A SILENT BUT POUNDINGLY RESONANT PAST. HERE THERE IS ALSO A PSYCHIC PAST FROM WHICH FREUD PULLED OUT THE UNCONSCIOUS. TO MAKE THAT EVEN CLEARER FAST-FORWARD A FEW YEARS TO PICASSO??S CUBIST WORK. IN THE BRONZE HEAD OF A WOMAN (1909) ACTUALLY A ??PORTRAIT? OF PICASSO??S LOVER FERNANDE OLIVIER THE HEAD BREAKS APART CHEEKS AND EYES BROWS AND MOUTH TRAVEL UNCHARTED PATHS. AS THE GREAT ART HISTORIAN ROBERT GOLDWATER (NOW ALAS BETTER KNOWN AS LOUISE BOURGEOIS?? HUSBAND) WROTE IN WHAT IS MODERN SCULPTURE? ??ROUNDED VOLUMES AND CONTINUOUS SURFACES HAVE BEEN FLATTENED INTO A SERIES OF ABRUPT PLANES??. ONE CAN ONLY GUESS AT THEIR SHAPES [EMPHASIS MINE].? PICASSO MANUFACTURED A SPACE NEVER ENCOUNTERED BEFORE ILLEGIBLE AND UNKNOWABLE. THE SAME THING HAPPENS IN HIS 1915 VIOLIN WHERE PIECES OF THE INSTRUMENT FLY OFF IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS CUTTING LOOSE FROM A TABLE A PERFORMER A SET RHYTHMIC BEAT. WHERE DOES THE VIOLIN LIVE? NOWHERE PRECISELY. WHERE DO OUR THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS LIVE? NOWHERE PRECISELY. PERHAPS THIS IS WHERE THE UNCONSCIOUS LIVES. EVEN AS A YOUNG ARTIST PICASSO POSSESSED THE CONFIDENCE TO LET THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HIS EYE AND HARD-MATTER OBEY THE INSTINCTS OF HIS UNCONSCIOUS. HE TRUSTED THAT THE UNREADABLE IS WHERE LIFE WAS AS FREUD ALSO BELIEVED. THAT??S ALSO WHY HUMOR WAS SO IMPORTANT TO PICASSO THE WAY A JOKE CAMOUFLAGES SOMETHING ELSE. WHAT??S REAL WHAT??S NOT? NOW YOU SEE ME NOW YOU DON??T. COLLAGED TABLES NEWSPAPERS WOMEN GUITARS GLASSES SKIDDING ACROSS AND UNDER AND INTO A WILD NEVER-NEVER LAND. YOU WON??T EVER REALLY KNOW AND THEREFORE WILL HAVE TO LIVE WITH THE IMMENSE RISK??AND EXCITEMENT??OF UNCERTAINTY. BURIED IN HUMOR ARE CENSORED UNSPOKEN URGES. PICASSO NEEDED SCULPTURE TO OPEN THIS DISCUSSION. THE URGE TO SEE TO REALIZE THE PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL IS A LIBIDINOUS AFFAIR. AND THAT DRIVE CARRIED PICASSO TO THIS INQUIRY. I??M NOT SPEAKING ONLY OF SEXUAL DESIRE HERE THOUGH THAT MUSTN??T BE DISCOUNTED. I??M SPEAKING OF LIBIDINOUS DRIVES IN THE LARGEST SENSE: WHAT MAKES YOUR MIND SOAR AND WANDER AND WHAT TAKES YOUR BODY ON THE MOST SURPRISING TRIPS. IT??S THAT LIBIDO??THE URGE TO LIVE TO COMPREHEND TO FLY TO FUCK??THAT EXPLAINS WHY SO MUCH A MAJORITY OF PICASSO??S SCULPTURE RELATES TO WOMEN??AND INTERESTINGLY NOT TO HIS TWO MOST INTELLECTUAL COMPANIONS DORA MAAR AND FRAN??OISE GILOT. RATHER THE WOMEN WHO INSPIRED HIS SCULPTURES WERE OLIVIER MARIE-TH??R??SE WALTER AND JACQUELINE ROQUE. PICASSO TRIPS EASILY FROM CLASSIC FORMS TO STICK FIGURES TO PHALLIC HEADS TO COMIC STRIPS TO VOLUPTUOUS UPDATED CLASSICAL VESSELS. AND ALL THE GIRLS ARE EMPHATICALLY DIFFERENT: VASE: WOMAN (1948) PREGNANT WOMAN (1950) WOMAN IN THE GARDEN (1929-30) HEAD OF A WOMAN (1931-32). AND IN RECOGNITION OF THAT DIVERSITY OF WOMEN LET??S FINALLY SET ASIDE THE FOOLISH ACCUSATION AGAINST PICASSO OF MISOGYNY THE CLAIM THAT HE REDUCES ALL WOMEN TO WOMAN. PICASSO IS NEVER GUILTY OF THAT. THE RICHNESS OF EMOTIONAL TEXTURE IN HIS GIANT HEADS OF WALTER IN HEAD OF A WOMAN ALONE BESPEAK AN EXPANSE OF EMOTIONAL AND VISUAL RESPONSES TO WOMEN ALL OF IT IN THE PHALLIC AND VAGINAL FORMS PILED ONE ATOP THE OTHER IN THOSE MAGNIFICENT??AND TERRIFYING??HEADS. HE REVELS IN SEXUAL HEAT BUT FEARS THE LOSS OF SELF. THE DESPERATION IN THAT LONGING AND ATTACHMENT IS PRESENT AS WELL. EVEN THE EARLY JESTER (1905) WHICH STARTED OUT AS A PORTRAIT OF THE POET MAX JACOB WITH WHOM PICASSO IS SAID TO HAVE HAD A FLIRTATION SUGGESTS THE EROTIC MOTOR OF PICASSO??S SCULPTURE: TO FATHOM TO MAKE TO FUCK. PERHAPS PICASSO NEVER TOOK SCULPTURE AS SERIOUSLY AS PAINTING. HOWEVER THAT MAY ALSO EXPLAIN WHY SCULPTURE IS THE MEDIUM WHERE PICASSO LET IT ALL HANG OUT. PICASSO SCULPTURE RUNS THROUGH FEBRUARY 7 AT THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART IN NEW YORK CITY. ,3401.0
574,9900156.0,2016-01-13T17:00:00+00:00,FLORIDA WHOOPING COUGH OUTBREAK FUELS ANTI-VAXXERS,ACCORDING TO A REPORT RELEASED TODAY IN THE JOURNAL EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES OVER A FIVE-MONTH PERIOD STARTING IN LATE 2013 MORE THAN TWO DOZEN CHILDREN IN A FLORIDA PRESCHOOL WERE DIAGNOSED WITH PERTUSSIS (ALSO KNOWN AS WHOOPING COUGH). IN ADDITION TWO MEMBERS OF THE STAFF AND 11 FAMILY MEMBERS OR OTHER CONTACTS OF CHILDREN THERE ALSO MET CRITERIA FOR DIAGNOSIS. NEARLY ALL THE CHILDREN IN THE PRESCHOOL HAD BEEN COMPLETELY VACCINATED AGAINST THE ILLNESS. TO SAY THAT I AM UNENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT REPORTING THIS OUTBREAK WOULD BE SOMETHING OF AN UNDERSTATEMENT. I AM AN UNAMBIGUOUS PROPONENT OF COMPREHENSIVE VACCINATION FOR ALL CHILDREN EXCEPT THOSE WITH A MEDICAL CONDITION THAT PRECLUDES IT. HOWEVER RESPONSIBLE MEDICAL PROVIDERS AND PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS HAVE A DUTY TO ACCURATELY INFORM PEOPLE WHEN SOMETHING GOES WRONG. (HINT: IF THERE REALLY WERE A MASSIVE BIG PHARMA CONSPIRACY TO POISON KIDS WITH SHOTS WE??D PROBABLY MAKE MORE OF AN EFFORT TO COVER THIS SORT OF THING UP.) THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE OUTBREAK BEGAN IN DECEMBER OF 2013 WHEN A ONE-MONTH-OLD INFANT TESTED POSITIVE FOR THE DISEASE. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT AN OLDER SIBLING (WHO HAD BEEN VACCINATED) AND THE INFANT??S MOTHER BOTH HAD HAD SYMPTOMS CONSISTENT WITH THE ILLNESS PRIOR TO THE BABY??S DIAGNOSIS. FOLLOWING A QUERY FROM THE COUNTY??S DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH THE PRESCHOOL BEGAN A SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM AND REPORTED ANY NEW CASES OF AN ILLNESS INVOLVING A COUGH. A TOTAL OF 26 STUDENTS AT THE SCHOOL WERE EVENTUALLY IDENTIFIED AS HAVING PERTUSSIS. OF THE MORE THAN 100 CHILDREN IN THE PRESCHOOL ONLY FIVE HAD NOT BEEN FULLY VACCINATED. THE TWO CLASSROOMS THAT HAD THE HIGHEST ATTACK RATE (AR) FROM THE DISEASE WERE POPULATED WITH THREE-YEAR-OLDS ONE HAD AN AR OF NEARLY 50 PERCENT AS WELL AS AN INFECTIOUS STAFF MEMBER. FOR ADVOCATES OF VACCINATION IT WOULD BE COMFORTING IF WE COULD PIN THIS OUTBREAK ON IMPROPER STORAGE OR ADMINISTRATION OF THE PERTUSSIS VACCINE. THAT SEEMS UNLIKELY HOWEVER. THE REPORT NOTES THAT AFFECTED CHILDREN HAD RECEIVED THEIR IMMUNIZATIONS FROM VARIOUS PROVIDERS IN THE COMMUNITY AND THERE WAS NO INCREASED INCIDENCE OF DISEASE WITHIN THE COUNTY AS A WHOLE. IT SEEMS THE VACCINE SIMPLY WAS NOT AS EFFECTIVE AS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN. THIS MAY STEM FROM A CHANGE IN THE KIND OF VACCINATION USED TO PROTECT AGAINST WHOOPING COUGH MADE DECADES AGO. EARLIER VERSIONS OF THE DTP VACCINE (WHICH ALSO PROTECTS QUITE WELL AGAINST DIPHTHERIA AND TETANUS) WERE PRODUCED USING BROKEN-DOWN WHOLE CELLS OF PERTUSSIS BACTERIA. WHILE EFFECTIVE SAFETY CONCERNS ABOUT RARE BUT SERIOUS REACTIONS TO THE WHOLE-CELL VACCINE BEGAN TO EMERGE. THIS LED THE DEVELOPMENT AND LICENSURE IN THE EARLY 1990S OF THE DTAP VACCINE CURRENTLY IN USE AN ??ACELLULAR? VERSION THAT DOES NOT CONTAIN THE OLDER COMPONENT AND CAUSES LESS OF A REACTION (PDF). UNFORTUNATELY IT MAY NOT CONFER AS MUCH PROTECTION EITHER. THIS IS DUE AT LEAST IN PART TO THERE BEING ONLY FIVE IMMUNITY-TRIGGERING ELEMENTS TO THE VACCINE INSTEAD OF THE THOUSANDS FOUND IN THE WHOLE PERTUSSIS CELL. ??DTAP HAS LONG BEEN KNOWN TO HAVE WANING IMMUNITY? EXPLAINED DR. SAUL HYMES A PEDIATRIC INFECTIOUS DISEASE SPECIALIST AT STONY BROOK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL IN RESPONSE TO MY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE NEW REPORT. ??BUT WHAT THIS USUALLY MEANS IS THAT OTHER THAN THOSE WHO ARE UNVACCINATED THE VACCINATED CHILDREN WHO WOULD BE AT GREATEST RISK ARE THOSE AGES 7-10 OR TEENAGERS. THESE ARE THE AGE RANGES WITH THE GREATEST GAP BETWEEN VACCINES THIS OUTBREAK IS VERY STRANGE IN THAT NEARLY ALL THE CASES WERE IN INFANTS AND CHILDREN WHO WERE APPROPRIATELY VACCINATED FOR AGE.? DR. HYMES HAS A COUPLE OF THEORIES AS TO WHAT COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE FLORIDA OUTBREAK. ??THE CLOSE PROXIMITY AND HIGH EASE OF TRANSMISSION IN A DAYCARE SETTING MEANT EXTREMELY HIGH BACTERIAL LOADS WERE BEING PASSED AROUND THAT COULD HAVE OVERCOME ANY WANING IMMUNITY PRESENT? HE CONTINUED. ??I THINK PERTUSSIS OUTBREAKS ARE IN GENERAL UNDER-RECOGNIZED. IT ISN'T TESTED FOR OR CLINICALLY IDENTIFIED NEARLY AS OFTEN AS IT SHOULD BE. IT MAY BE THE CASE THAT OUR ESTIMATES OF REAL-WORLD VACCINE EFFICACY MAY BE OVERLY OPTIMISTIC IF THERE IS ACTUALLY MORE PERTUSSIS THAT ISN'T BEING DIAGNOSED.? THIS IS CERTAINLY CONSISTENT WITH AN ADDITIONAL FINDING DISCUSSED IN THE ARTICLE. EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS A CONFIRMED OUTBREAK IN THEIR AREA MANY PHYSICIANS WERE RELUCTANT TO TEST FOR OR DIAGNOSE PERTUSSIS BECAUSE THEIR PATIENTS HAD BEEN RECENTLY VACCINATED. THE AUTHORS ADMONISH PROVIDERS TO CONSIDER PERTUSSIS EVEN IN VACCINATED PATIENTS WHEN THERE IS REASON TO BE CLINICALLY SUSPICIOUS. IT BEARS MENTIONING THAT DESPITE FAILING TO PREVENT THIS OUTBREAK THERE WERE STILL BENEFITS TO VACCINATION AGAINST PERTUSSIS. IN MANY CASES THE ILLNESS WAS DIFFICULT TO RECOGNIZE BECAUSE WHOOPING COUGH IS OFTEN MUCH MILDER IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BEEN IMMUNIZED. AND WHILE FAR BELOW OPTIMAL LEVELS THE STUDY DID REPORT ABOUT 45 PERCENT EFFICACY IN PREVENTING THE DISEASE TOO. AS DR. HYMES NOTED IN OUR COMMUNICATIONS 45 PERCENT IS A LOT BETTER THAN ZERO. ??DESPITE THE OUTBREAK [THIS ARTICLE] STILL SHOWS HOW GOOD VACCINES ARE? HE WENT ON. ??VERY FEW [A TOTAL OF FOUR] OF THE PATIENTS WHO GOT PERTUSSIS WOUND UP IN THE HOSPITAL AND NONE DIED. THE OUTCOME WOULD HAVE ALMOST CERTAINLY BEEN WORSE WITH UNVACCINATED CHILDREN.? BUT I COULD BANKRUPT MYSELF AT SEPHORA AND STILL NOT TURN THIS PIG INTO A PROM QUEEN. THE NEWS FROM FLORIDA IS NOT GOING TO MAKE THINGS ANY EASIER FOR THOSE OF US WHO ADVOCATE FOR THE BENEFITS OF VACCINATING YOUR KIDS. VACCINATIONS REMAIN A HUGELY CONTENTIOUS ISSUE FOR MANY MUCH TO MY DISMAY. FOR EVIDENCE ONE NEED LOOK NO FARTHER THAN THE HUGE RESPONSE THAT ENSUED WHEN FACEBOOK FOUNDER MARK ZUCKERBERG POSTED A STATUS UPDATE OF HIS KID AT THE DOCTOR??S OFFICE WITH THE CAPTION ??TIME FOR VACCINES!? (THANK YOU MARK. I HEREBY FORGIVE YOU FOR ALL THOSE ??MEMORIES? FACEBOOK KEEPS INSISTING I SHOULD BE SHARING.) BUT WHATEVER VACCINE OPPONENTS MAKE OF THIS NEWS IT DOESN??T FORM A BASIS FOR ANY KIND OF SOLID ARGUMENT AGAINST ADMINISTERING THEM. IT PROVIDES EVIDENCE THAT VACCINES AGAINST ONE PARTICULAR ILLNESS AREN??T AS EFFECTIVE AS THEY SHOULD BE AND THAT WORK ON A MORE EFFECTIVE VERSION IS NECESSARY. IT REMINDS PROVIDERS THAT PERTUSSIS SHOULD STILL BE ON THEIR MINDS IF THEY SEE A PATIENT WITH A PROLONGED COUGH EVEN IF THAT PATIENT HAS BEEN VACCINATED. AND IT DEMONSTRATES THAT EVEN A SUBOPTIMAL VACCINE IS STILL BETTER THAN NONE. WHAT IT DOESN??T SAY IS ANYTHING ABOUT THE OTHER SAFE EFFECTIVE VACCINES AGAINST OTHER DISEASES. IT DOESN??T EVEN MEAN IT??S NOT WORTH IT TO VACCINATE YOUR KIDS WITH THE DTAP VACCINE THAT??S CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. BETTER TO GET A MILDER FORM OF AN OTHERWISE POTENTIALLY FATAL ILLNESS AFTER ALL. IT MAY NOT BE NEWS HAPPY TO REPORT BUT IT DOESN??T CHANGE ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT I??LL BE RECOMMENDING TO MY PATIENTS. ,20352.0

IT??S A COMPELLING NARRATIVE AND IT MAKES FOR A GREAT TEA PARTY RALLY SPEECH. CRUZ WAS HIS SON??S MOST BELOVED SURROGATE DURING THE 2012 TEXAS SENATE RACE AND THE ADMIRATION HE FOUND FROM TEA PARTY CROWDS ONLY GREW. BUT AS RAFAEL CRUZ??S STAR HAS RISEN SO HAVE A MULTITUDE OF MYTHS ABOUT HIS LIFE THAT TEAM CRUZ DOESN??T EXACTLY DISCOURAGE - LIKE FOR EXAMPLE THE ONE ABOUT HOW CRUZ IS A FREEDOM FIGHTER FROM A ??HELLHOLE? WHO STOOD UP AGAINST COMMUNISM TURNED DALLAS-BASED PASTOR WITH HIS VERY OWN CHURCH. SO WHILE RAFAEL HIMSELF AND THE CRUZ CAMPAIGN HAVEN??T (TO OUR KNOWLEDGE) PUBLICLY SAID ANYTHING INACCURATE ABOUT HIS PERSONAL HISTORY THEY HAVE LEFT UNCORRECTED SOME TALES THAT MEMBERS OF THE MEDIA AND PROMINENT CONSERVATIVE ACTIVISTS HAVE WOVEN ABOUT CRUZ THE ELDER -- INCLUDING TALES THAT ARE TOTALLY DIVORCED FROM REALITY (AND IN SOME CASES EASILY FOUND ON THE INTERNET). THERE??S RAFAEL THE MAN -- A FASCINATING AND INFLUENTIAL PERSON IN HIS OWN RIGHT -- AND THERE??S RAFAEL THE MYTH AN ODD DUCK WHO FOUGHT COMMUNISM AND PASTORS A CHURCH OUTSIDE OF DALLAS. IT??S UNCLEAR WHERE THE RAFAEL CRUZ MYTHOLOGIES CAME FROM AND HOW MUCH THEY BENEFIT HIS STANDING IN THE EVANGELICAL COMMUNITY. BUT IT??S CLEAR THAT THE MYTHS ARE PERNICIOUS AND THAT THEY??RE IMPACTFUL. ONE OF THE FIRST AND MOST GALLING FALSEHOODS ABOUT RAFAEL CRUZ??S PAST IS THE NOTION THAT HE FOUGHT COMMUNISM. HE DIDN??T BUT THAT HASN??T STOPPED SOME OF HIS MOST VOCAL BACKERS FROM REPEATING IN CONTRAVENTION OF ALL FACT THAT HE SUFFERED UNDER COMMUNISM AND TOOK ON FIDEL CASTRO. IN FACT GLENN BECK ONE OF RAFAEL CRUZ??S BIGGEST FANS ARGUES AS MUCH IN THE FORWARD TO RAFAEL CRUZ??S OWN BOOK ??A TIME FOR ACTION: EMPOWERING THE FAITHFUL TO RECLAIM AMERICA? RELEASED JUST THIS WEEK (PUBLISHED BY WORLDNETDAILY OF ??LONG FORM BIRTH CERTIFICATE PLEASE? FAME). ??[W]HEN RAFAEL CRUZ TOLD HIS TEENAGE SON ABOUT THE TORTURE THE FIGHTING THE OPPRESSION THE MURDER AND THE COMMUNIST HELLHOLE HE GREW UP IN ?? THERE??S NO DOUBT THAT IMAGERY SHOOK HIS YOUNG SON TO THE CORE AND BURNED AN UNFORGETTABLE IMAGE AND FEELING THAT WOULD NEVER EVER GO AWAY? BECK WROTE. CUBA MAY HAVE BEEN A HELLHOLE WHEN RAFAEL CRUZ WAS GROWING UP THERE. BUT THERE??S ONE THING IT WASN??T: COMMUNIST. AS ANDY KROLL DETAILED IN HIS NATIONAL JOURNAL PROFILE OF RAFAEL CRUZ THE FUTURE SENATOR??S FATHER FOUGHT AGAINST THE ISLAND NATION??S DICTATOR GENERAL FULGENCIO BATISTA. AND AT ONE POINT THE GENERAL??S FORCES CAPTURED AND TORTURED HIM. ??BEHIND EVERY GREAT MAN IS AN EVEN GREATER FATHER? BECK ADDS. ??AND LET IT BE STATED FOR THE RECORD UNEQUIVOCALLY: RAFAEL CRUZ IS ONE OF THE GREATEST FREEDOM FIGHTERS OF HIS GENERATION.? IN REALITY THE BATISTA REGIME GAVE RAFAEL CRUZ A STUDENT VISA IN 1957 WHICH HE USED TO TRAVEL TO THE U.S. TWO YEARS LATER IN 1959 CASTRO BECAME PRIME MINISTER OF CUBA AND THE ISLAND NATION BECAME A COMMUNIST COUNTRY. AND WHEN IT COMES TO LITERAL FIGHTING IN ARMED CONFLICT RAFAEL CRUZ FOUGHT ON ONLY ONE SIDE: FIDEL??S. BUT THIS FALSE IMPLICATION THAT HE WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HISTORY STILL FINDS ITS WAY INTO THE FIRST PAGES OF HIS VERY OWN BOOK. THIS ISN??T THE ONLY INSTANCE OF CRUZ WORLD OVERLOOKING MISPERCEPTIONS ABOUT CRUZ THE ELDER??S CUBAN BACKGROUND. IN 2011 WHEN TED CRUZ WAS RUNNING FOR SENATE THERE WAS A CONTROVERSY OVER WHETHER THE SENATOR HAD PERPETUATED THE MYTH THAT HIS FATHER LEFT CUBA AFTER CASTRO TOOK POWER. THE DALLAS MORNING NEWS DETERMINED THAT THEN-CANDIDATE CRUZ HAD NEVER MADE THAT PARTICULAR FALSE ASSERTION. BUT THEY STILL CRITICIZED THE CANDIDATE. ??CRUZ THOUGH HAS REMAINED SILENT AS JOURNALISTS AND POLITICAL ACTIVISTS INCORRECTLY PLACED HIS FATHER AMONG THE MANY CUBANS WHO LEFT THE ISLAND NATION AFTER CASTRO TOOK POWER RATHER THAN AS SOMEONE WHO FOUGHT ON THE SAME SIDE AS CASTRO TO TOPPLE A RIGHTIST DICTATOR THOUGH HE DEPARTED FOR TEXAS BEFORE THE REVOLUTION SUCCEEDED? THE PAPER WROTE. THAT REPORT NOTES THAT KELLY SHACKLEFORD WHO INTRODUCED CRUZ TO THE 2011 VALUE VOTERS SUMMIT SAID HIS FAMILY FLED CASTRO??S REGIME. AND CRUZ DIDN??T CORRECT HIM. BUT THAT??S NOT THE ONLY PERSISTENT RUMOR. MULTIPLE MAJOR PUBLICATIONS HAVE REPORTED RAFAEL CRUZ: THAT HE PASTORS A CHURCH IN THE SUBURBS OF DALLAS. EXCEPT THAT HE HASN??T. EVER. RICK TYLER A SPOKESMAN FOR CRUZ??S CAMPAIGN TOLD THE DAILY BEAST THAT THESE REPORTS ARE ALL WRONG AND THAT RAFAEL CRUZ HAS NEVER PASTORED ANY CHURCHES. HE IS AN ORDAINED MINISTER TYLER SAID BUT HAS NEVER LED A CONGREGATION. ?ŸINSTEAD TYLER SAID CRUZ??S MINISTRY FOCUSES ON PREACHING SERMONS TO GROUPS OF PASTORS AND THAT HE WAS ORDAINED THROUGH A PROGRAM BASED IN TEXAS CALLED MINESTERIOS MUNDO DE FE. STILL STORIES IN MAJOR OUTLETS RAN SAYING CRUZ ??IS A PASTOR AT A BAPTIST CHURCH IN SUBURBAN DALLAS? OR THAT HE WAS ??RAISED CATHOLIC HE BECAME BORN AGAIN AND IS NOW A PASTOR AT A DALLAS CHURCH.? EVEN RELIGION NEWS SERVICE MADE THE SAME STATEMENT ON SEPT. 12 2015. ??NOW RAFAEL PASTORS A CHURCH IN DALLAS AND DIRECTS THE PURIFYING FIRE MINISTRIES MINISTERING IN THE U.S. MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA AND CAMPAIGNS FOR TED AMONG PASTORS? THE OUTLET REPORTED. ?Ÿ THEY WERE HARDLY ALONE. THE INCORRECT ASSERTION WAS ALSO PART OF A BIO OF RAFAEL CRUZ FOR A FAMILY LEADERSHIP SUMMIT WHERE HE SPOKE. ??TODAY RAFAEL CRUZ IS A PASTOR AT A CHURCH IN DALLAS AND SERVES AS THE DIRECTOR OF PURIFYING FIRE MINISTRIES MINISTERING IN THE U.S. MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA? SAID AN INFORMATION PAGE ABOUT THE EVENT. RALPH HOLLAND WHO HEADS MUNDO DE FE EMAILED THAT HIS MINISTRY ORDAINED CRUZ. ??RAFAEL HAS TRAVELLED TO OUR NETWORK CHURCHES IN LATIN AMERICA AND HAS BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE IN HIS MINISTRY? HOLLAND WROTE. ??HE IS OFTEN SOLICITED IN THE CHURCHES. I HAVE PERSONALLY ACCOMPANIED HIM ON MANY OF THOSE TRIPS AND WITNESSED FIRSTHAND HIS EFFECTIVENESS.? HOLLAND ADDED THAT CRUZ IS ??VERY THEOLOGICALLY VERSED.? ANY RELATION TO ??PURIFYING FIRE MINISTRIES? BY THE WAY IS ANOTHER CRUZ MYTHOLOGY. TYLER SAID CRUZ INITIALLY BRANDED HIS WORK PREACHING TO PASTORS?? GROUPS WITH THAT MONIKER BUT DITCHED IT WHEN HE REALIZED THAT SUZANNE HINN -- WIFE OF FAMOUS AND SKETCHY TELEVANGELIST BENNY HINN -- HAD A MINISTRY WITH ALMOST THE IDENTICAL NAME.

IT SEEMED LIKE A GIVEN THAT IN RESPONSE TO CRUZ??S SLIGHT TRUMP MIGHT CALL HIM A MAPLE SYRUP-GUZZLING LOSER WHO CAN??T STAY ON TOP OF THE POLLS IN IOWA AND WOULD NEVER MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN LIKE THE DONALD WILL. BUT WHEN THE ATTENTION TURNED TO TRUMP SOMETHING UNEXPECTED HAPPENED. FIRST HE CORRECTED CRUZ??MANHATTAN PRODUCES CONSERVATIVES HE SAID ??INCLUDING WILLIAM F. BUCKLEY AND OTHERS? (AND WHAT KIND OF DEMOCRAT WOULD NAME DROP WILLIAM F. BUCKLEY?) AND THEN HE SEEMED TO STAND UP TALLER. ??HE INSULTED A LOT OF PEOPLE? TRUMP SAID OF CRUZ. ??NEW YORK IS A GREAT PLACE. IT??S GOT GREAT PEOPLE IT??S GOT LOVING PEOPLE WONDERFUL PEOPLE. WHEN THE WORLD TRADE CENTER CAME DOWN I SAW SOMETHING THAT NO PLACE ON EARTH COULD HAVE HANDLED MORE BEAUTIFULLY MORE HUMANELY THAN NEW YORK.? THE CROWD APPLAUDED AND AS IF TO ADMIT DEFEAT SO DID CRUZ. ??YOU HAD TWO 110-STORY BUILDINGS COME CRASHING DOWN THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE KILLED AND THE CLEANUP STARTED THE NEXT DAY AND IT WAS THE MOST HORRIFIC CLEANUP PROBABLY IN THE HISTORY OF DOING THIS AND IN CONSTRUCTION. I WAS DOWN THERE? TRUMP SAID. ??I??VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT AND THE PEOPLE IN NEW YORK FOUGHT AND FOUGHT AND FOUGHT AND WE SAW MORE DEATH AND EVEN THE SMELL OF DEATH??NOBODY UNDERSTOOD IT AND IT WAS WITH US FOR MONTHS. THE SMELL THE AIR. AND WE REBUILT DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN AND EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD WATCHED AND EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD LOVED NEW YORK AND LOVED NEW YORKERS AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT WAS A VERY INSULTING STATEMENT THAT TED MADE.? CRUZ JUST LOOKED AT THE CAMERA WITH A NERVOUS SMILE.

IT DESERVES A GENEROUS HELPING OF BOTH. SET IN THE MYTHICAL TOWN OF MEXIFORNIA LOCATED ON THE U.S.-MEXICO BORDER THE SERIES??WHICH AIRS SUNDAYS AT 8:30 PM??DEALS WITH THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN TWO FAMILIES. THE BUCHWALDS AND THE GONZALEZES RESIDE NEXT DOOR TO ONE ANOTHER. BUT AS WE SOON SEE THEY LIVE A WORLD APART. STARTING WITH HEADS OF HOUSEHOLDS. BUD BUCHWALD IS A BORDER PATROL AGENT AND ERNESTO GONZALEZ IS A MEXICAN IMMIGRANT. BUD??S DAUGHTER BECKY IS DATING ERNESTO??S NEPHEW ??JC???AN AMERICANIZED ABBREVIATION OF JUAN CARLOS. AND VOTERS HAVE APPROVED AN ANTI-IMMIGRANT ??SHOW-ME-YOUR-PAPERS? ORDINANCE BECAUSE AS BUD PUTS IT: ??IT??S ABOUT TIME WE DID SOMETHING ABOUT IMMIGRATION. THE SOUTHWEST BELONGS TO METH LAB ENTREPRENEURS AND RETIRED ART TEACHERS.? YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE DEED TO THAT PROPERTY BUD. THE SOUTHWEST ONCE BELONGED TO MEXICO AND MEXICAN IMMIGRANTS ARE RECLAIMING IT??ONE HARDSCRABBLE SUCCESS STORY AT A TIME. DELIVERING FUNNY GAGS AND CLEVER DIALOGUE WITH THE SUBTLETY OF AN OBAMA IMMIGRATION RAID THE SERIES??WHICH WAS CREATED BY FAMILY GUY WRITER MARK HENTEMANN AND EXECUTIVE-PRODUCED BY FAMILY GUY CREATOR SETH MACFARLANE??IS ALREADY GENERATING PLENTY OF BUZZ IN THE LATINO COMMUNITY. IN FACT PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS SHOW MONTHS BEFORE THE FIRST EPISODE AIRED. PART OF THE REASON FOR THE HIGH LEVEL OF INTEREST IS THAT WHILE LATINOS??PARTICULARLY THOSE IN MY PARENTS?? GENERATION WHICH GREW UP IN THE 1940S??ARE ALWAYS ON THE LOOKOUT FOR TELEVISION PROGRAMMING FEATURING LATINO CHARACTERS AND FAMILIAR CULTURAL THEMES ACTUAL SIGHTINGS ARE RARE. AND ONCE A SHOW AIRS AND GETS CANCELLED THERE IS OFTEN A SIGNIFICANT LAG-TIME BEFORE NETWORKS ARE GAME ENOUGH TO TAKE ANOTHER BITE OUT OF THE TAMALE. THAT??S HOW THEY DO IN HOLLYWOOD RIGHT? YOU COULD HAVE 100 WHITE MALES STRIKE OUT WITH CRAPPY PROGRAMS AND THEY??RE RIGHT BACK IN THE DIRECTOR??S CHAIR BEFORE LUNCH. YOU WON??T HEAR TOP STUDIO EXECUTIVES TALKING ABOUT TAKING A DECADE-LONG SABBATICAL FROM DOING OTHER PROJECTS BY WHITE MALES. BUT THAT??S THE GAME THEY RUN ON LATINOS. IN 1984 AKA PABLO??PRODUCED BY NORMAN LEAR AND STARRING A YOUNG COMIC NAMED PAUL RODRIGUEZ??PREMIERED ON ABC. IT WAS CANCELED AFTER SIX EPISODES AFTER WEEKS OF TAKING FIRE FROM LATINO ACTIVISTS FOR REINFORCING STEREOTYPES. IN 2002 GEORGE LOPEZ??PRODUCED BY SANDRA BULLOCK AND STARRING COMEDIAN GEORGE LOPEZ??HAD ITS DEBUT ON ABC IN 2002 AND RAN FOR FIVE SEASONS BEFORE BEING CANCELLED IN 2007. IT??S NOW IN SYNDICATION. IN 2014 ABC PUT FORTH ITS THIRD LATINO COMEDY WITH CRISTELA CREATED BY AND FEATURING COMIC CRISTELA ALONSO WHO BECAME THE FIRST LATINA TO CREATE PRODUCE WRITE AND STAR IN A PRIMETIME COMEDY. THE SHOW WAS CANCELLED AFTER ONE SEASON. AND FINALLY THIS FALL NBC LAUNCHED TELENOVELA??STARRING EVA LONGORIA WHO IS ALSO AN EXECUTIVE PRODUCER ON THE TELEVISION COMEDY. THE NETWORK ORIGINALLY ORDERED 13 EPISODES BUT LATER CUT BACK ITS REQUEST TO JUST 11 EPISODES. WITH THAT TRACK RECORD YOU WOULD THINK THAT THE ARRIVAL OF BORDERTOWN??WHICH FOX BILLED AS TAKING ??A SATIRICAL LOOK AT THE CULTURAL SHIFTS OCCURRING THROUGHOUT AMERICA???IN THE PRIMETIME LINE-UP OF A MAJOR NETWORK WOULD BE WARMLY RECEIVED BY LATINOS. BUT IF YOU BELIEVE THAT YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF MY PEEPS IS A TACO SHORT OF A COMBINATION PLATE. WE??RE O.P.??ORIGINAL PESSIMISTS. GIVE US A SILVER LINING AND WE??LL FIND A CLOUD. SURE ENOUGH. WITHIN MINUTES OF THE CLOSING CREDITS THERE WERE GRUMBLINGS AND BARBS FLOATING ABOUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA??INCLUDING MANY FROM LATINOS. CRITICS SAID THE SHOW WAS LOW-BROW CRASS EMBARRASSING AND JUVENILE. SOME PROCLAIMED IT SIMPLY TERRIBLE A SILLY SHOW THAT PROMOTES UGLY CULTURAL STEREOTYPES AND GIVES WHITE PEOPLE LICENSE TO LAUGH AT US. AND THOSE WERE SOME OF THE NICER COMMENTS. CLEARLY LIKE OTHER OFFERINGS FROM SETH MACFARLANE THIS SHOW WON??T BE EVERYONE??S CUP OF TEQUILA. I FIGURED THAT OUT WHEN BECKY TURNED TO J.C. AND SAID: ??I WANT YOU TO PUT A BABY IN ME SO I CAN FIGHT FOR THE RIGHT TO LEGALLY ABORT IT.? OR WHEN BRYCE A JANITOR AT THE BORDER PATROL STATION WAS ABDUCTED BY ALIENS IN A SPACESHIP LOOKING FOR A ??CHEAP ANAL PROBE.? WHILE THE SHOW IS ON MAYBE YOU SHOULD LEAVE YOUR 68-YEAR-OLD ABUELA IN THE OTHER ROOM. NO NOT YOU MRS. CLINTON. BUT C??MON FOLKS. NOT EVERYTHING ON TELEVISION HAS TO BE DOWNTON ABBEY. THERE MUST CERTAINLY BE ROOM ON THE CREATIVE SPECTRUM FOR A SHOW LIKE BORDERTOWN WHICH TACKLES SENSITIVE SUBJECTS LIKE IMMIGRATION ASSIMILATION LANGUAGE CULTURE AND RACE RELATIONS WITH A MIX OF HUMOR AND IRREVERENCE. HAVING COME TO GRIPS WITH THE FACT THAT THE IMMIGRANT NEIGHBOR HE LOOKS DOWN ON IS ACTUALLY MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN HE IS BUD SPEAKS FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICANS STRUGGLING WITH A RAPIDLY CHANGING WORLD WHEN HE TURNS TO HIS WIFE AND SAYS: ??I JUST DON??T KNOW WHERE A GUY LIKE ME FITS IN ANYMORE??? AND YOU CAN??T HELP BUT CHUCKLE WHEN ERNESTO ASKS A MEXICAN-AMERICAN BORDER PATROL AGENT WHO INSISTS HE DOESN??T SPEAK SPANISH: ??HOW ARE YOUR PARENTS FRANCISCO AND CONSUELA?? AND INDIGNANTLY HE RESPONDS: ??FRANK AND CONNIE ARE FINE!? ANOTHER THING THAT HELPS SHAPE HOW LATINOS ARE REACTING TO BORDERTOWN IS THE FACT THAT THE PROJECT INVOLVES SEVERAL LATINO WRITERS AND PRODUCERS. THEY INCLUDE JOURNALIST GUSTAVO ARELLANO WHO SERVES AS A CONSULTANT AND CARTOONIST LALO ALCARAZ WHO SERVES AS CONSULTING PRODUCER. HERE??S SOMETHING YOU MIGHT HAVE NOTICED: LATINOS DON??T OFTEN PAT EACH OTHER ON THE BACK??UNLESS THEY??RE LOOKING FOR A SOFT SPOT TO STICK THE KNIFE. NEED I MAKE HERE THE OBVIOUS REFERENCE TO TED CRUZ AND MARCO RUBIO? ETHNIC LOYALTY IS OVERRATED. FOR THOSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO BREAK THAT PATTERN AND BE SUPPORTIVE OF A COUPLE OF LATINOS WHO DONE GOOD BORDERTOWN GIVES THEM THE OPPORTUNITY. THOSE WHO DON??T HAVE ANYTHING NICE TO SAY COULD TAKE THEIR MOTHER??S ADVICE AND SAY NOTHING. SO LATINOS WHO DIDN??T LIKE THE SHOW HAVE A PROBLEM: SHOULD THEY BE SUPPORTIVE BY HOLDING THEIR TONGUES OR SAY THEIR PIECE EVEN IF IT MAKES THEM SEEM LIKE JUST ANOTHER CRAB IN A BUCKET? FINALLY THERE??S THE SOUL-SEARCHING THAT ALWAYS ACCOMPANIES THE ARRIVAL OF SHOWS LIKE THIS: SHOULD LATINOS BE GRATEFUL TO FOX FOR BEING BRAVE ENOUGH TO WADE INTO THESE WATERS OR TRASH THE OFFERING AND DEMAND BETTER PROGRAMMING? IF ACTIVISTS CHOOSE THE LATTER THEY COULD WIND UP WITH NOTHING. THERE ARE NO ENTITLEMENTS IN THIS GAME. HOLLYWOOD DOESN??T OWE US A THING AND NO ONE SAID THAT BEING ABLE TO SEE OUR EXPERIENCES REFLECTED ON TELEVISION WAS OUR BIRTHRIGHT. IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING SOME LATINOS WILL STILL BE CRITICAL OF BORDERTOWN. BUT I HAVE TO ASK: WHAT ARE THEY AFRAID OF? DOES ANYONE REALLY FEAR THAT THE REST OF AMERICA WILL WATCH A SHOW LIKE THIS AND COME AWAY THINKING THAT THIS ANIMATED SERIES IS REALLY A DOCUMENTARY THAT ALL LATINOS ARE REALLY LIKE THIS? IF THAT??S TRUE THEN WE HAVE MUCH BIGGER PROBLEMS THAN WHAT??S ON TELEVISION. ,5800.0

BUT BUNDY IS NOT SPREADING THE WORD OF GOD THOUGH HE??S A DEVOUT MORMON. INSTEAD BUNDY IS TELLING LOCAL RESIDENTS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ILLEGITIMATE THAT THE COUNTY GOVERNMENT IS THE HIGHEST AUTHORITY IN THE LAND AND THAT THEY SHOULD ARREST THEIR LOCAL SHERIFF AND SUBJECT HIM TO A CITIZEN GRAND JURY IF HE SIDES WITH THE TREACHEROUS FEDS. THIS IS THE GOSPEL OF THE SOVEREIGN CITIZEN MOVEMENT??AND BUNDY IS WINNING CONVERTS. I??M FROM RURAL UTAH. YOU CAN??T GROW UP IN RURAL PARTS OF AMERICA AND NOT KNOW MILITIA TYPES. I??VE MET FIVE PEOPLE FROM SOUTHERN UTAH UP HERE ALREADY BUNDY??S BROTHER RYAN LIVES IN MY HOMETOWN. WHEN AMMON AND HIS SUPPORTERS TOOK OVER MALHEUR A WEEK AGO I STARTED CALLING AROUND TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON AND WAS ASKED TO TELL THE ??REAL STORY.? IT STARTED WHEN DWIGHT AND STEVEN HAMMOND WERE ORDERED BACK TO PRISON AFTER APPARENTLY NOT SERVING ENOUGH TIME FOR AN ARSON CONVICTION FOR BURNING SOME FEDERAL LAND. THE HAMMONDS HAVE BEEN FIGHTING THE BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT FOR DECADES AFTER BLM GAINED CONTROL OF A STRIP OF LAND BETWEEN THEIR RANGE AND PASTURE REFUSING TO LET THEM DRIVE OVER IT. THANKS IN PART TO THIS FIGHT REP. GREG WALDEN GOT LEGISLATION PASSED TO REIN IN BLM. THE BUREAU IGNORED IT ACCORDING TO WALDEN AND THEN CHARGED THE HAMMONDS AND OTHER RANCHERS EXORBITANT FEES TO ACCESS THEIR OWN LAND. IF CONGRESS CAN??T EVEN CONTROL FEDERAL AGENCIES WHAT??S A RANCHER SUPPOSED TO? AMMON BUNDY HAD AN ANSWER. HE HAS BEEN HERE FOR MONTHS EDUCATING RANCHERS ABOUT THE TENETS OF THE SOVEREIGN CITIZEN MOVEMENT. SEE THE FEDS DON??T LISTEN TO THE LAW BUT YOU DON??T HAVE TO LISTEN TO THE FEDS HE TOLD THEM. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS NOT LEGITIMATE THE HIGHEST AUTHORITY HERE IS THE COUNTY AND THE SHERIFF WHO CAN TELL BLM AND FBI TO GET LOST. ??THE SHERIFF HAS A SWORN DUTY TO PROTECT HIS CITIZENS? AMMON BUNDY SAYS AS ANOTHER MAN FINISHES HIS SENTENCE ??AGAINST ALL ENEMIES BOTH FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC.? THESE IDEAS ARE TAKEN CHAPTER AND VERSE FROM THE SOVEREIGN CITIZEN BIBLE A BIZARRE TRIBUTARY OF RIGHT-WING IDEOLOGY THAT BELIEVES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN ILLEGALLY OCCUPYING AMERICAN LAND SINCE AT LEAST THE END OF THE CIVIL WAR. THESE IDEAS HAVE INSPIRED MILITIAS OVER THE PAST FOUR DECADES PARAMILITARY-STYLE GROUPS THAT OFTEN ALLOW WOULD-BE DEMAGOGUES TO PRESENT THEMSELVES AS REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ORIGINAL ??DIVINELY INSPIRED? FORM OF GOVERNMENT. THESE FORCES FUELED DEADLY STANDOFFS AT RUBY RIDGE AND WACO CULMINATING IN THE BOMBING OF THE MURRAH FEDERAL BUILDING IN OKLAHOMA CITY. THAT TERROR ATTACK HURT THE MILITIA MOVEMENT BUT IT HAS GROWN DRAMATICALLY DURING THE OBAMA YEARS. AMMON??S MEN SAYS HARNEY COUNTY SHERIFF DAVID WARD IS NOTHING LESS THAN A COLLABORATOR WITH THE REAL ENEMY: THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. ??SHERIFF YOUR OATH WAS NOT MADE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NOR ANY OF THEIR CORPORATE ENTITIES SUCH AS THE BLM OR FOREST SERVICE ETC? THE MEN WROTE IN AN OPEN LETTER. ??WHERE WERE YOU WHEN A FOREIGN ENTITY NOT HAVING ANY CONSTITUTIONAL POWER AUTHORITY AND JURISDICTION WITHIN YOUR COUNTY ABUSED YOUR CITIZENS? ?? HAVE YOU TAKEN SIDES WITH THE FEDS?? ?Ÿ?Ÿ IF THE SHERIFF DOES NOT SAY ??NO TO THE FEDS AND RID??YOUR COUNTY OF THEIR PRESENCE AND TYRANNY THAT THEY HAVE SPREAD ACROSS YOUR COUNTY? THEN LOCALS SHOULD FORM A CITIZEN GRAND JURY AND INDICT HIM. SOME RANCHERS ARE LISTENING BECAUSE THEY??VE TRIED EVERYTHING ELSE AND FEEL SCREWED BY THE GOVERNMENT. WHEN PEOPLE COME TO GIVE THE FEDS A TASTE OF THEIR OWN MEDICINE BY TAKING OVER SOME OF UNCLE SAM??S LAND THE RANCHERS HOPE THIS WILL BE THE THING THAT FINALLY FORCES THE GOVERNMENT TO OBEY ITS OWN LAWS. SECURITY IS TIGHT AT THE COMPOUND. MEN WITH ANTI-GOVERNMENT PATCHES HOLDING ASSAULT RIFLES PATROL THE BUILDINGS IN FULL TACTICAL GEAR. THERE??S A TRUCK PARKED CROSSWISE ACROSS THE ROAD AT THE ENTRANCE. TWO GUARDS IN SKI MASKS SURVEY THE AREA FROM A TOWER. SOME OF THE GUARDS ARE PROVIDED BY A MILITIA GROUP CALLED THE THREE PERCENTERS. THEY TAKE THEIR NAME FROM THE IDEA THAT ONLY 3 PERCENT OF AMERICAN COLONISTS FOUGHT IN THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR AND IT WOULD ONLY TAKE THE SAME SLICE OF AMERICA TO LIBERATE FROM ITS FEDERAL OPPRESSORS TODAY. THE MILITIAMEN PATROL THE PERIMETERS AND EVEN DRIVE THROUGH THE CLOSEST MAJOR TOWN BURNS 30 MILES AWAY. BRANDON CURTISS PRESIDENT OF THE IDAHO THREE PERCENTERS SAID THEY??RE HERE TO ??MAKE SURE THIS DOESN??T TURN INTO A WACO SITUATION BUT WE??RE ALSO HERE TO MAKE SURE THAT EXTREMIST ELEMENTS PEOPLE WHO REALLY DO WANT TO START TROUBLE DON??T COME IN.? MANY PEOPLE CARRY GUNS: A RUGER P89 A MAKAROV .9MM A .45 REVOLVER. THE HANDGUNS NEVER LEAVE THEIR HOLSTERS EXCEPT FOR CLEANING EXCEPT WHEN PEOPLE GATHERED AROUND TO ADMIRE SOME BEAUTIFUL ENGRAVING ON ONE SIDEARM. BUNDY HAS EXPELLED PEOPLE FOR CARRYING LONG ARMS OPENLY AS IT WAS AN UNNECESSARY ESCALATION. HE IS PLAYING A LONG GAME MINDFUL OF PR. THERE IS ALSO NO ALCOHOL IN THE BUILDINGS. YOU MIGHT SEE AN OCCASIONAL FLASK UP THE HILL OUTSIDE (I WAS OFFERED A SLUG OF MOONSHINE TO WARD OFF THE COLD.) NOBODY WANTS AMMON TO SEE THEM DRINKING. INSIDE THE ENCAMPMENT MORE THAN TWO DOZEN MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN OCCUPY STONE AND WOOD BUILDINGS SURROUNDED BY SNOW-COVERED TREES AND PICNIC TABLES. THERE??S A BUNKHOUSE OFFICES A KITCHEN. THE BEDS ARE MEANT FOR FIREFIGHTERS AND VISITING BIOLOGISTS BUT THEY SERVE ARMED OCCUPIERS JUST AS WELL. THE OCCUPIERS ARE RESUPPLIED BY LOCALS FRIENDLY TO THE CAUSE. CUPBOARDS BURST WITH JERKY TRAIL MIX CRACKERS. IF YOU??RE GOING TO CONDUCT AN ARMED TAKEOVER OF FEDERAL BUILDINGS YOU NEED LIGHTWEIGHT THINGS FILLED WITH CALORIES ESPECIALLY IN THE WINTER. WHEN ONE DRIVER ANNOUNCED HE WAS CARRYING DOUGHNUTS LAUGHING MEN RAIDED HIS BACK SEAT WHILE A CHILD BEGGED HIS MOM FOR PERMISSION TO JOIN IN. ANOTHER RANCHER BROUGHT A WHOLE CORD OF WOOD AND ANOTHER BOUGHT WINTER JACKETS. RESUPPLY HAPPENS HOURLY DEPENDING ON WHAT THE RANCHERS HAVE TO SPARE. SOMEONE FOUND THE KEYS TO THE WILDLIFE REFUGE??S TRUCKS ALTHOUGH ONLY TRUSTED PEOPLE GET THE KEYS. ??THIS BELONGS TO WE THE PEOPLE? YOU HEAR OVER AND OVER. MILITIA MEMBERS AND SUPPORTIVE LOCALS HAVE ALREADY RENAMED THE NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE AS THE ??HARNEY COUNTY RESOURCE CENTER.? SIMILARLY THE OCCUPIERS SAY THE BUILDINGS ARE OPEN TO ANYONE BUT THEY AREN??T FRIENDLY TO OUTSIDERS EXCEPT LOCALS. PERFECTLY POLITE ALWAYS BUT NOT FRIENDLY. IN FACT THEY DON??T TALK TO PRESS OUTSIDE OF CANNED RESPONSES FOR THE MOST PART. THE MEETINGS ARE CLOSED PARANOIA IS RUNNING HIGH. WHO IS COMING AND WHEN AND WHAT WILL WE DO? WHAT IS THE PLAN? BUT WALKING AROUND YOU HEAR SNIPPETS OF CONVERSATION. SOME PEOPLE APPRECIATE THE SNARK OF ??Y??ALL QAEDA? AND LAUGH AT ??VANILLA ISIS? TOO. THEY??RE NOT WITHOUT HUMOR BUT THEY SPEND MOST OF THE TIME TALKING TACTICS AND POLITICS. ??WE HAVE TO WAKE UP THE RESIDENTS? ONE SAYS. ??WE CAN ONLY PRAY THAT THEY WILL SEE HOW MUCH STRENGTH THEY HAVE ANOTHER SAYS. ??ARTICLE II THOUGH??.? A DIFFERENT MAN BEGINS TO IMPLORE. ??YOU KNOW THIS IS ALL NOT THE REAL PROBLEM? SAYS ONE OF THE NEWCOMERS AROUND THE CAMPFIRE AT NIGHT. ??IT??S THOSE MUSLIMS COMING IN HERE THE GOVERNMENT IS LETTING THE TERRORISTS IN AND CALLING THEM REFUGEES.? JOHN RITZHEIMER AN IRAQ WAR VETERAN FOND OF WEARING ??FUCK ISLAM? T-SHIRTS AND PROTESTING MOSQUES SHUTS THAT CHATTER DOWN. ??YOU KNOW I AGREE WITH YOU. THAT??S WHAT I DO FOR A LIVING WHEN I??M NOT HERE TRY TO TELL PEOPLE ABOUT THIS [RADICAL ISLAM] THREAT. BUT THAT??S NOT WHY WE??RE HERE AND WE??RE NOT GOING TO GET INTO IT NOW.? THE DISCUSSION TURNS TO THE UNITED NATIONS AGENDA 21 THE NEW WORLD ORDER AND THE ILLUMINATI. ONE MAN COVERS ALL THE CAMERAS ON HIS DEVICES SO THE GOVERNMENT CAN??T TURN THEM ON REMOTELY HE SAYS WHICH EDWARD SNOWDEN REVEALED WAS NOT A PARANOID FANTASY. PEOPLE ARE FRUSTRATED THAT THE PRESS COVERAGE IS FOCUSING ON THE GUNS AND THE CRAZY TALK. THE STORY IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT HARNEY COUNTY THE PLIGHT OF THE RANCHERS. AMMON??S ACTIONS WERE MEANT TO BRING ATTENTION TO THE INJUSTICE AND OVERREACH BY THE GOVERNMENT. WHILE EVERYONE SORT OF KNEW THAT CITY FOLK MIGHT MISINTERPRET THINGS LOCALS ARE ASTONISHED THAT THEY ONLY HEAR ABOUT GUNS ON THE NEWS. THESE PEOPLE ARE CUT OFF FROM THE REST OF THE COUNTRY REALLY THE DAYS MELT INTO EACH OTHER JUST LIKE THE SEASONS. CIVIL UNREST IN CITIES AND THE IDEA THAT PERHAPS THE FOURTH ESTATE ISN??T AS RESPONSIBLE AS IT ONCE WAS ARE NEW AND FRIGHTENING THINGS. THE RANCH FAMILY I STAY WITH HAS DISCUSSIONS LONG INTO THE NIGHT ABOUT HOW THEY ARE LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE COUNTRY THAN THEY EVER WANTED TO LEARN. WHEN I SHOWED THEM FOOTAGE OF POLICE BRUTALLY CRACKING DOWN IN FERGUSON THEY WERE SHOCKED TO THEIR CORE EVEN KNOWING HOW MALEVOLENT POWER CAN BE. I NEVER EXPECTED TO HEAR THE SAME EMOTIONS AND PHILOSOPHIES FROM A 15-YEAR-OLD GANG MEMBER IN MISSOURI AND A 67-YEAR-OLD RANCHER IN RURAL OREGON BUT CLOSE YOUR EYES AND YOU??LL HEAR IT. ??WHY DON??T THEY JUST FOLLOW THE LAW?? ASKS THE RANCHER WHO PREFERS TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS FOR FEAR OF BLM RETRIBUTION. ??WE??RE NOT BEING VIOLENT WE??RE JUST TRYING TO GET JUSTICE.? THE MEDIA IS STARTING TO GO HOME AND THE RANCHERS SURROUNDING THE REFUGE ARE NOW LEFT WITH THE FALLOUT: PEOPLE COME TO SEE WHAT THE FUSS IS ABOUT AND NOBODY CAN DENY THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE ALL VERY NICE. AT FIRST THE RANCHER WAS CAUTIOUSLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE BUNDYS EVEN BRINGING SUPPLIES TO THE MEN. NOW THAT ATTENTION HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO THE PLIGHT OF HARNEY COUNTY THE RANCHER WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE BUNDYS GO HOME. PEOPLE LIVING HERE WANT RESPECT NOT A REVOLUTION. ,110541.0

1175,10284069.0,2016-01-26T05:01:00+00:00,HOW NEW YORK CITY OPERA CAME BACK FROM DEATH,THE NEARLY TWO-YEAR LONG BATTLE FOR THE RESURRECTION OF THE NEW YORK CITY OPERA (NYCO) CAME TO A CLOSE LAST WEEK. NYCO-RENAISSANCE (NYCO-R) HEADED BY HEDGE FUND MANAGER ROY NIEDERHOFFER AND MICHAEL CAPASSO FORMER HEAD OF THE NOW DEFUNCT DICAPO OPERA THEATRE OPENED THEIR FIRST PRODUCTION A SIX SHOW RUN OF GIACOMO PUCCINI??S TOSCA AT THE ROSE THEATRE AT JAZZ AT LINCOLN CENTER WITH THE FULL LEGAL AUTHORITY TO USE THE NYCO NAME. WHETHER IT STAYS ALIVE HOWEVER IS ANOTHER STORY. NYCO??S UNTIMELY AND VERY PUBLIC DEATH LEFT THE METROPOLITAN OPERA THE ONLY MAJOR OPERA COMPANY IN NEW YORK CITY. MOST LARGE EUROPEAN CITIES HAVE MORE THAN ONE MAJOR OPERA COMPANY LONDON AND PARIS HAVE TWO EACH BERLIN AND VIENNA EACH HAVE THREE AND THAT IS NOT COUNTING THE MYRIAD OF SMALLER COMPANIES THAT PERFORM IN EACH OF THOSE CITIES. THE CLOSURE OF NYCO AND THE GENERAL MADNESS SURROUNDING THE METROPOLITAN OPERA IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS HAVE CAUSED SOME TO DOUBT THE FUTURE OF OPERA AS AN ART FORM IN THE US. THE ATTEMPTED RESURRECTION OF NYCO HAS BEEN WATCHED CLOSELY BY US OPERA FANS ANXIOUSLY HOPING FOR A POSITIVE SIGN REGARDING THE FUTURE OF OPERA. BUT NYCO??S RESURRECTION RAISES MORE QUESTIONS THAN IT ANSWERS ABOUT THE COURSE OPERA COMPANIES AND PRODUCTION IN THE US MAY TAKE IN THE FUTURE. THE BIZARRE AND CONVOLUTED BATTLE TO RESURRECT NYCO AFTER IT DECLARED BANKRUPTCY IN LATE 2013 HAS BEEN COVERED HERE AND HERE) BUT MUCH HAS HAPPENED IN THE SIX MONTHS LEADING UP TO LAST WEDNESDAY??S OPENING NIGHT. IN LINE WITH THE OPERATIC NATURE OF THE PROCEEDINGS SINCE NYCO??S BANKRUPTCY EVERYTHING CAME DOWN RIGHT TO THE WIRE. IT WASN??T UNTIL JANUARY 12TH 2016 LESS THAN EIGHT DAYS BEFORE THE OPENING THAT JUDGE SEAN LANE OF THE US BANKRUPTCY COURT IN MANHATTAN GREENLIT NYCO-R??S PLANS FOR RESURRECTING NYCO AND GAVE THEM LEGAL AUTHORITY TO USE THE NYCO NAME AND REMAINING ASSETS. THESE INCLUDED AN APPROXIMATELY $4.5 MILLION ENDOWMENT AND A BEQUEST TO THE ORIGINAL NYCO IN THE WILL OF A WEALTHY BENEFACTOR ESTIMATED AT $7 MILLION. IN EARLY DECEMBER 2015 NIEDERHOFFER AND CAPASSO??S MAIN OPPONENT IN THE BATTLE FOR CONTROL OF THE REMAINS OF NYCO ARCHITECT GENE KAUFMAN DROPPED OUT OF THE HUNT AND APPEARED TO PAVE A CLEAR ROAD FOR NYCO-R TO TAKE POSSESSION OF NYCO??S NAME AND ASSETS. BUT EVEN THIS POSITIVE TURN OF EVENTS FOR NYCO-R WAS NOT WITHOUT DRAMA. ON JANUARY 5 2016 ONE MONTH AFTER KAUFMAN??S TEAM DROPPED OUT AND JUST UNDER TWO WEEKS BEFORE NYCO-R??S OPENING NIGHT THE NY DISTRICT ATTORNEY??S OFFICE ISSUED A COURT FILING QUESTIONING THE LONG-TERM FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF NYCO-R??S PLAN. A SEPARATE FILING BY THE DA??S OFFICE QUESTIONED THE PLANNED PAYMENT BY NYCO-R TO KAUFMAN??S NEW VISION FOR NYC OPERA FOR ??ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND ATTORNEYS?? FEES? BECAUSE OF HOW MUCH SUCH A PAYMENT ??WOULD DEPLETE THE ALREADY LIMITED ASSETS? AVAILABLE TO CITY OPERA. THAT DID NOT DETER NIEDERHOFFER AND CREW. AFTER REVISING THEIR PLAN TO IN PART ALLOW MR. NIEDERHOFFER??S FOUNDATION INSTEAD OF NYCO-R TO MAKE THE PAYMENT TO KAUFMAN DIRECTLY THEY PUSHED FORWARD AND ON JANUARY 12TH JUDGE LANE OFFICIALLY CONFIRMED NYCO-R??S REORGANIZATION PLAN. FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND LONGEVITY HAS BEEN A LONG STANDING CONCERN FOR THE NYCO-R PROJECT RAISED NOT JUST BY THE DA??S FILING BUT BY THOSE IN THE OPERA COMMUNITY WHO FEEL CAPASSO RAN HIS LAST COMPANY THE 207-SEAT DICAPO OPERA THEATRE ON THE UPPER EAST SIDE INTO THE GROUND. IN AN AP ARTICLE WIDELY CIRCULATED THE DAY BEFORE NYCO-R??S OPENING NIGHT LAST WEEK CAPASSO IS QUOTED AS SAYING OF HIS NYCO-R PLANS ??MY FIVE-YEAR PLAN WILL REINVIGORATE THE REPERTORY BRING IT BACK TO THE GLORY DAYS. IT??S A MODEL IN TERMS OF HOW TO PROGRAM A SEASON THAT WILL HAVE WIDEST POSSIBLE APPEAL.? MANY FOUND THIS AN ODDLY CONFIDENT STATEMENT COMING FROM A MAN WHO WAS SUED BY THE MUSICIAN??S UNION LOCAL 802 OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF MUSICIANS FOR UNPAID WAGES IN 2010 AND WHO CLOSED DICAPO IN 2013 STILL OWING MANY PEOPLE MONEY OVER A YEAR BEFORE THE NYCO-R PROPOSAL ORIGINATED. ADDITIONALLY CAPASSO??S BOMBAST AND HUBRIS COULD BE PERCEIVED AS EVERYTHING THAT THE GENERAL PUBLIC THINKS IS WRONG WITH AND OFF-PUTTING ABOUT OPERA IN GENERAL: LOFTY DISTANT ELITIST SOUNDING PLATITUDES THAT ARE ULTIMATELY EMPTY AND WITHOUT RELEVANCE TO THE TODAY??S AUDIENCES. NOT EXACTLY THE WAY TO ATTRACT NEW AUDIENCES. THE ORIGINAL NYCO STOOD AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE MORE TRADITIONAL METROPOLITAN OPERA OFTEN PROGRAMMING NEW AMERICAN WORKS THAT HAD NOT AND PERHAPS WOULD NOT BE SEEN ELSEWHERE. TODAY MANY NEW WORKS ARE PRODUCED BY THE SMALLER COMPANIES THAT HAVE POPPED UP SINCE THE ORIGINAL NYCO??S DEPARTURE FROM LINCOLN CENTER. SO WHAT IS THE POSITION OF A NEW NYCO IN NYC? DOES NYC NEED OR EVEN WANT A NEW MAJOR OPERA COMPANY? WHAT DOES A ??PEOPLE??S OPERA? AS MAYOR FIORELLO LA GUARDIA CALLED THE ORIGINAL NYCO EVEN MEAN NOW? THESE QUESTIONS WERE DRAWN INTO EVEN SHARPER FOCUS AS NYCO-R??S TOSCA CAME JUST OVER A WEEK AFTER THE ENDING OF NYC??S 4TH ANNUAL PROTOTYPE FESTIVAL CO-PRODUCED BY BETH MORRISON PROJECTS AND HERE WHICH SPECIALIZES IN PRESENTING SMALLER MORE EXPERIMENTAL OPERA AND THEATRE WORKS AT VENUES ACROSS THE CITY. THE CENTERPIECE OF THIS YEAR??S FESTIVAL WAS THE NYC PREMIERE OF COMPOSER DAVID T. LITTLE??S SEARING POST APOCALYPTIC OPERA DOG DAYS. BETH MORRISON PROJECTS AND PROTOTYPE HAVE BECOME THE ENGINES FOR THE CUTTING EDGE OF NEW OPERATIC WORKS IN NYC SO WHERE DOES A NEW NYCO FIT IN? ADDITIONALLY VENTURE OPERA ON SITE OPERA AND THE HIGHLY ACCLAIMED LOFT OPERA ALL IN NYC ARE FAR SMALLER FASTER LIGHTER ON THEIR FEET THAN TRADITIONAL OPERA COMPANIES AND THEREFORE ABLE TO BE FAR MORE INTIMATE REACTIVE IMMERSIVE AND SITE SPECIFIC. IS THERE A MIDDLE GROUND BETWEEN THEM AND THE GRANDEUR AND SPECTACLE OF THE MIGHTY METROPOLITAN OPERA THAT EVEN NEEDS TO BE FILLED? THE NEW YORK CRITICS HAVE BEEN LUKEWARM ON BOTH THE FIRST PRODUCTION AND THE OVERALL POSITION OF NYCO-R. ANTHONY TOMMASINI OF THE NEW YORK TIMES PRAISED SOME OF THE SINGING BUT ADDED ??THE MUSICAL PERFORMANCE??WAS PRONE TO MISHAPS WITH SOME FLASHES OF INTENSITY BUT MANY INERT STRETCHES.? ON THE NIGHT I ATTENDED THE NYCO-R TOSCA I FOUND AN ATTRACTIVE YOUNGER FINANCE CROWD THAT I DO NOT SEE AT THE MET IN SUCH NUMBERS. SOME OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE WILL EVENTUALLY BE POISED TO BECOME THE NEXT GENERATION OF MEGA ARTS DONORS. THAT IS GREAT BOTH FOR NYCO-R AND OPERA IN GENERAL. HOWEVER WILL THEY RETURN IN THE FUTURE ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE FRUSTRATION AND CHAOS THE FACILITIES AT THE ROSE THEATRE AT JAZZ AT LINCOLN CENTER CAUSED? WAS IT NYCO-R OR THE ROSE??S FAULT THAT PEOPLE SPENT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE TWO INTERMISSIONS ON LINE FOR THE SINGLE WORKING MEN??S ROOM OR ON LINE AT THE SINGLE BAR WITH ONLY TWO WORKING CASHIERS? MANY PEOPLE DID NOT EVEN GET THE DRINK THEY WAITED 10 MINUTES ON LINE FOR AS INTERMISSION ENDED BEFORE THEY COULD. SEVERAL PEOPLE MISSED THE SECOND ACT BECAUSE THEY WERE WAITING FOR THE BATHROOMS AND THERE WERE NO LATE ADMISSIONS TO THE THEATRE AFTER EITHER INTERMISSION. I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THIS HAPPENED TO SOME FOR THE THIRD ACT AND THEY JUST LEFT. FINALLY AND MOST EGREGIOUSLY THE LIGHTS WERE DROPPED AND THE SECOND ACT BEGAN WHEN THERE WERE STILL MANY PEOPLE IN THE AISLES WAITING TO TAKE THEIR SEATS NOT HAVING HAD TIME AFTER THE ENDLESS LINES AND WAITING OF THE INTERMISSION. WHATEVER THE REASON IT MUST BE REMEDIED. NO ONE WILL RETURN TO A COMPANY THAT FORCES PATRONS TO CLAW THEIR WAY THROUGH A CROWDED AISLE IN THE DARK TO FIND THEIR SEATS LET ALONE DONATE TO ONE. NYCO-R PROMISED AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF THEIR SECOND SHOW SOON WITH CAPASSO PLEDGING TO ANNOUNCE THREE MORE IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS AND A TOTAL OF SIX FOR NYCO-R??S 2016-17 SEASON.

705,9992578.0,2016-01-16T05:01:00+00:00,HOW WE PLAYED AT THE PLAYBOY MANSION,THE NEWS THAT HUGH HEFNER??S PLAYBOY MANSION IN HOLMBY HILLS LOS ANGELES IS UP FOR SALE FOR $200 MILLION??REPORTEDLY AMERICA??S MOST EXPENSIVE HOME FOR SALE??RESONATED. I ENTERED THIS AMERICAN DREAMSCAPE IN 1973 ON ASSIGNMENT FOR ROLLING STONE THEN STILL BASED IN SAN FRANCISCO. MY REPORTAGE IS ONLINE SO I WON??T REPEAT MYSELF HERE. GALLERY:?ŸTHE PLAYBOY MANSION IN THE 1970S (PHOTOS) JUST IMAGINE AN OLD-FASHIONED ALMOST 20000 SQUARE FOOT EURO COUNTRY HOUSE SET AMONGST TROPIC GREENERY AND EXOTIC NOT-SO-WILD WILDLIFE WITH GAME-ROOMS JACUZZIS AND POOLS POPULATED BY PERFECT BABES AND A ROTATING CAST OF MORE-OR-LESS FAMOUS FAR FROM PERFECT GUYS. ?ŸI??LL DIG OUT ONE NUGGET THOUGH. ??PLAYBOY AND MY OWN LIFESTYLE ARE A RORSCHACH TEST WHERE PEOPLE FIND THEIR OWN FANTASIES? HEFNER TOLD ME. ??BUT YOU??VE GOT TO REALIZE THAT THIS ISN??T WHERE I EVER EXPECTED TO GO. THERE WAS NO PARALLEL. THERE WAS NO SUCH LIFESTYLE AS THIS WHEN I WAS GROWING UP THAT I COULD LOOK TO AND THINK: THIS IS THE LIFE THAT I WANT TO LIVE. I MEAN I DIDN??T KNOW ANYBODY WHO WAS FULFILLING THEIR PERSONAL UH ASPIRATIONS TO THE EXTENT THAT I??VE BEEN ABLE TO.? ANOTHER NUGGET. VICTOR LOWNES AND I WERE STROLLING THE GROUNDS. LOWNES WAS AN EARLY INVESTOR IN PLAYBOY WHO HAD BECOME AN EXECUTIVE AND IT WAS HE WHO PLAYED THE MR. PLAYBOY ROLE DURING THE TEN YEARS OR SO WHILE HEFNER HAD STAYING IN HIS CHICAGO ROOM PULLING MULTI-ALL-NIGHTERS AS HE PUT THE MAGAZINE AND CLUB EMPIRE TOGETHER. THEN HEFNER EMERGED. HE WAS NOW THE FAMOUS HEF. VICTOR LOWNES WAS RUNNING PLAYBOY??S EUROPEAN OPERATIONS FROM LONDON BUT MORE THAN CONTENTED. ??YOU KNOW IT WOULD BE A SHAME IF EVER ANYTHING WERE TO HAPPEN TO THIS? HE SAID AS WE WALKED AROUND. ??IT SHOULD BE KEPT FOREVER. AS A MONUMENT TO SYBARITISM.? BUT IT HAD BEEN THREATS TO THE DOMINANT POSITION OF THAT MONUMENT THAT HAD BROUGHT ME TO THE HOLMBY HILLS. THESE THREATS CAME FROM COMPETITORS THE FIRST AND MOST SERIOUS BEING THAT FROM PENTHOUSE. THIS MAGAZINE HAD BEEN LAUNCHED IN LONDON IN 1965 BY BOB GUCCIONE A BROOKLYN-BORN ARTIST AND CARTOONIST WHO CAREFULLY IMITATED THE PLAYBOY FORMAT BUT WITH EQUALLY CAREFUL DIFFERENCES ONE BEING THAT THE SEXUAL CONTENT WAS WAY MORE EXPLICIT. PENTHOUSE WAS SOON DOING WELL. IN 1969 GUCCIONE BROUGHT IT TO NEW YORK WHERE HE NOW HAD HIS OWN MANSION TOO THE LARGEST PRIVATE HOUSE IN MANHATTAN. THERE WERE OTHER BUDDING WANNABES OF VARYING COMPETENCE. OR NOT. I ADMIRED OUI A PLAYBOY-SPIN-OFF ALSO OUT OF CHICAGO WHERE A BUNNY A HELPFUL SOURCE OPENED A FILING CABINET AND SHOWED ME A FILE OF ??TERMINATED BUNNIES.??Ÿ BUT I DEVOTED LITTLE SPACE TO COQ MAGAZINE WHICH THE RECEPTIONIST PRONOUNCED ??COKE? AND WHICH HAD ITS OWN ??MANSION? ON THE UPPER FLOOR OF A BUILDING NOT FAR FROM WHERE PLAYBOY HAD BEEN BORN. EFFECTS ON PLAYBOY??S CIRCULATION HAD BEEN SLIGHT SO FAR. THIS HAD BEEN AROUND SEVEN MILLION AT ITS PEAK AND WHILE I WAS REPORTING WAS PERHAPS A FEW HUNDRED THOUSAND DOWN FROM THAT BUT GUCCIONE WAS TRUMPETING HIS EXPECTATION THAT PENTHOUSE WOULD BE OVERTAKING PLAYBOY THE FOLLOWING YEAR AND MORE EXPLICIT SEX WAS VERY MUCH PART OF HIS BUSINESS STRATEGY. THIS DIDN??T SEEM TO BE MUCH ON ANYBODY??S MIND IN THE MANSION THOUGH. DOWN ON HOLMBY HILLS THERE WAS AN INNER CORE WHOLLY MALE OF WHOM HALF A DOZEN SEEMED TO BE AROUND HEFNER AT ALL TIMES NONE OF WHOM WERE CONNECTED TO HEFNER??S BUSINESS LIFE. AND WHEN THERE WASN??T A PARTY THEY AND HE WOULD BE ENGAGED IN A PRINCIPAL PURSUIT OF THAT PERIOD BACKGAMMON A PASSION WHICH WAS SO DEVOURING THEN THAT I DON??T REMEMBER JUST WHEN IT WOULD SPUTTER OUT. BUT THEN THERE WERE THE PARTIES. AND THESE HAD DIFFERENT LEVELS OF INTENSITY. THOSE ON THE LIST COULD DROP BY ANYTIME AND EAT AND DRINK RATHER WELL. SOME DID NOT STINT. THE WINE CELLAR HAD JUST BEEN UPGRADED WHILE I WAS THERE AND THE FEMALE SOMMELIER COMPLAINED TO ME THAT NOT ONLY DID SOME GUESTS HELP THEMSELVES TO HANDFULS OF CIGARS BUT THAT ONE WAS EXTREMELY INSISTENT ON GETTING THE CHATEAU LAFITTE ??64 WHICH HAD JUST GONE UP TO $60 A BOTTLE AND WOULD NOT ONLY DOWN IT HIMSELF BUT INSIST THAT ALL THE BUNNIES AND PARTY GIRLS IN HIS VICINITY QUAFF IT TOO. AH YES. THE PARTY GIRLS. THERE WERE ALSO THE MORE PRIVATE PARTIES. ONE DAY I SAT IN WHILE THE SOCIAL LIFE WAS BEING ORGANIZED. BACKGAMMON TOURNAMENTS A MOVIE SCREENING. ??SHALL WE GET SOME PEOPLE OVER?? ASKED HEFNER??S SECRETARY IN CHIEF. ??YEAH! LET??S GET SOME FRIENDS OVER? HEFNER SAID. NAMES WERE SUGGESTED. GIRLS. ??BUT REMEMBER!? HEFNER SAID. ??WE??RE JUST TIRED ... MIDDLE-AGED ... MEN. THEY CAN??T EXPECT TOO MUCH.? VICTOR LOWNES DREW ATTENTION TO MY PRESENCE. ??REMEMBER THAT TONY IS UH DOING THIS PIECE FOR ROLLING STONE? HE SAID. TWO OF BILL COSBY??S ACCUSERS HAVE CLAIMED THAT THE UGLINESS TOOK PLACE IN THE PLAYBOY MANSION. MY PIECE WAS DULY PUBLISHED. I WAS TOLD THAT HEFNER HATED IT AND I WAS NO LONGER WELCOME AT THE MANSION. DAMN! THREE YEARS AFTER PUBLICATION STEVE JOBS STARTED APPLE. THE PARTY GIRLS WERE SOON FLYING OFF INTO CYBERSPACE AND THE SLIGHT DECLINE IN THE CIRCULATION OF PLAYBOY PRECIPITATED BY PENTHOUSE BECAME A PRECIPITOUS TUMBLE. PENTHOUSE WENT BANKRUPT IN 2013. PLAYBOY SOLD 820000 COPIES LAST YEAR. AS FOR LIFE IN THE MONUMENT TO SYBARITISM NOWADAYS WELL DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE A TELL-ALL BY HOLLY MADISON HEFNER??S SEVEN YEAR LIVE-IN GIRLFRIEND--HE IS NOW MARRIED TO 29-YEAR-OLD CRYSTAL HARRIS--DESCRIBES A BEDDING RITUAL WHICH SOUNDS LIKE EROTIC PANTOMIME WHAT WITH MULTIPLE WOMEN MOSTLY BLONDES IN MATCHING PINK PAJAMAS PORNO MOVIES POT DESULTORY PENETRATIONS. STILL A RORSCHACH TEST? PERHAPS. AND THE MANSION? HEFNER BOUGHT IT AND THE FIVE-ACRE ESTATE IN 1971 FOR $1.1 MILLION A RECORD AT THE TIME BUT THE COMPANY IN WHICH HEFNER IS NOW A MINORITY SHAREHOLDER AT 30 PERCENT HAVE BEEN SHELLING OUT FOR THE RUNNING COSTS FOR QUITE A SPELL. THE ASKED-FOR $200 MILLION IS TWICE WHAT ANY COMPARABLE NEARBY PROPERTY HAS FETCHED. ALSO THE PURCHASER WILL BE REQUIRED TO ALLOW HEFNER NOW 84 TO STAY IN POSSESSION FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE. THE PLAYBOY MANSION ISN??T LOSING ITS MAIN PLAYER. ,22514.0

707,9992580.0,2016-01-16T05:01:00+00:00,THE MAN WHO SURVIVED HIROSHIMA & NAGASAKI,HE WAS TRAVELLING ACROSS HIROSHIMA ON A PUBLIC TRAM WHEN HE HEARD THE DRONING SOUND OF AN AIRCRAFT ENGINE IN THE SKIES ABOVE. TSUTOMU YAMAGUCHI THOUGHT NOTHING OF IT. AFTER ALL IT WAS WARTIME AND PLANES WERE FOREVER PASSING ABOVE THE CITY. HE WAS UNAWARE THAT THE ENGINES BELONGED TO THE U.S. BOMBER ENOLA GAY AND THAT IT WAS JUST SECONDS AWAY FROM DROPPING A 13 KILOTON URANIUM ATOMIC BOMB ON THE CITY. AS THE PLANE APPROACHED ITS TARGET AT 8:15 A.M. ON AUGUST 6 1945 YAMAGUCHI HAD JUST STEPPED OFF THE TRAM. HE GLANCED AT THE SKY AND NOTICED A BOMBER PASSING OVERHEARD. HE ALSO SAW TWO SMALL PARACHUTES. AND THEN QUITE WITHOUT WARNING ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE. ??[THERE WAS] A GREAT FLASH IN THE SKY AND I WAS BLOWN OVER.? THE MASSIVE NUCLEAR WARHEAD HAD EXPLODED LESS THAN THREE KILOMETERS FROM THE SPOT WHERE HE WAS STANDING. THE BOMB WAS DETONATED AT 600 METERS ABOVE HIROSHIMA. AS YAMAGUCHI SWUNG HIS GAZE UPWARDS HE SAW A VAST MUSHROOM-SHAPED PILLAR OF FIRE RISING HIGH INTO THE SKY. SECONDS LATER HE PASSED OUT. THE BLAST CAUSED HIS EARDRUMS TO RUPTURE AND THE FLASH OF LIGHT LEFT HIM TEMPORARILY BLINDED. THE HEAT OF THE EXPLOSION WAS SUCH THAT IT LEFT HIM WITH SERIOUS BURNS OVER THE LEFT SIDE OF HIS BODY. WHEN HE EVENTUALLY REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS HE CRAWLED TO A SHELTER AND TRIED TO MAKE SENSE OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED. FORTUNATELY HE STUMBLED ACROSS THREE COLLEAGUES WHO HAD ALSO SURVIVED. ALL WERE YOUNG ENGINEERS WORKING FOR THE SHIPBUILDER MITSUBISHI HEAVY INDUSTRIES. THEY HAD BEEN UNLUCKY ENOUGH TO BE SENT TO HIROSHIMA ON THE VERY DAY OF THE BOMBING. THEY SPENT THE NIGHT TOGETHER IN AN AIR-RAID SHELTER NURSING THEIR BURNS AND WOUNDS. THEN ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING THEY VENTURED OUT OF THEIR SHELTER AND PICKED THEIR WAY THROUGH THE CHARRED AND MOLTEN RUINS. AS THEY WENT TO THE NEAREST FUNCTION- ING RAILWAY STATION THEY PASSED PILES OF BURNT AND DYING BODIES. THEIR AIM WAS TO CATCH ONE OF THE FEW WORKING TRAINS BACK TO THEIR HOMETOWN OF NAGASAKI SOME 200 MILES AWAY. YAMAGUCHI WAS IN A POOR STATE AND WENT TO HAVE HIS WOUNDS BANDAGED AS SOON AS HE REACHED NAGASAKI. BUT BY AUGUST 9 AFTER JUST TWO DAYS OF CONVALESCENCE HE FELT WELL ENOUGH TO STRUGGLE INTO WORK. HIS BOSS AND HIS CO-WORKERS LISTENED IN HORRIFIED AMAZEMENT AS HE DESCRIBED THE UNBELIEVABLE DESTRUCTION THAT A SINGLE BOMB HAD MANAGED TO CAUSE. HE TOLD THEM HOW THE EXPLOSION HAD MELTED METAL AND EVAPORATED ENTIRE PARTS OF THE CITY. HIS BOSS SAM SIMPLY DIDN??T BELIEVE HIM. ??YOU??RE AN ENGINEER? HE BARKED. ??CALCULATE IT. HOW COULD ONE BOMB DESTROY A WHOLE CITY?? AT THE EXACT MOMENT HE SAID THESE WORDS??11:02 A.M.??THERE WAS A BLINDING WHITE FLASH THAT PENETRATED TO THE HEART OF THE?Ÿ ROOM. YAMAGUCHI??S TENDER SKIN WAS ONCE AGAIN PRICKED WITH HEAT AND HE CRASHED TO THE GROUND. ??I THOUGHT THAT THE MUSHROOM CLOUD FOLLOWED ME FROM HIROSHIMA? HE SAID LATER. THE U.S. AIR FORCE HAD DROPPED THEIR SECOND NUCLEAR WARHEAD??FAT MAN??NAMED AFTER WINSTON CHURCHILL. IT WAS MUCH LARGER THAN THE HIROSHIMA DEVICE A 25 KILOTON PLUTONIUM BOMB THAT EXPLODED IN THE BOWL OF THE VALLEY WHERE NAGASAKI IS SITUATED. THE DESTRUCTION WAS MORE CONFINED BUT EVEN MORE INTENSE THAN AT HIROSHIMA. SOME 74000 WERE KILLED AND A SIMILAR NUMBER INJURED. YAMAGUCHI HIS WIFE AND HIS BABY SON MIRACULOUSLY SURVIVED AND SPENT MUCH OF THE FOLLOWING WEEK IN AN AIR-RAID SHELTER NEAR WHAT WAS LEFT OF THEIR HOME. FIVE DAYS LATER THEY HEARD THE NEWS THAT EMPEROR HIROHITO HAD ANNOUNCED JAPAN??S SURRENDER. YAMAGUCHI??S SURVIVAL OF BOTH NUCLEAR EXPLOSIONS WAS LITTLE SHORT OF MIRACULOUS. YET IT WAS LATER DISCOVERED THAT HE WAS ONE OF 160 PEOPLE KNOWN TO HAVE LIVED THROUGH BOTH BOMBINGS. IN 1957 HE WAS RECOGNIZED AS A HIBAKUSHA OR ??EXPLOSION-AFFECTED PERSON.? BUT IT WAS NOT UNTIL 2009 THAT HE WAS OFFICIALLY ALLOWED TO DESCRIBE HIMSELF AS AN ENIIJUU HIBAKUSHA OR DOUBLE BOMB SURVIVOR. THE EFFECTS OF THE DOUBLE BOMBINGS LEFT ITS SCARS BOTH MENTAL AND PHYSICAL. YAMAGUCHI LOST THE HEARING IN HIS LEFT EAR AS A RESULT OF THE HIROSHIMA EXPLOSION. HE ALSO LOST HIS HAIR TEMPORARILY. HIS DAUGHTER WOULD LATER RECALL THAT HE WAS SWATHED IN BANDAGES UNTIL SHE REACHED THE AGE OF 12. YAMAGUCHI BECAME AN OUTSPOKEN OPPONENT OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS UNTIL HE WAS WELL ADVANCED IN YEARS AT WHICH POINT HE BEGAN TO SUFFER FROM THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF THE EXPOSURE TO RADIATION. HIS WIFE DEVELOPED LIVER AND KIDNEY CANCER IN 2008 AND DIED SOON AFTER. YAMAGUCHI HIMSELF DEVELOPED ACUTE LEUKEMIA AND DIED IN 2010 AT THE AGE OF 93. HIS LONGEVITY WAS EXTRAOR- DINARY AS HE KNEW ONLY TOO WELL. HE VIEWED HIS LONG LIFE AS A ??PATH PLANTED BY GOD.? ??IT WAS MY DESTINY THAT I EXPERIENCED THIS TWICE AND I AM STILL ALIVE TO CONVEY WHAT HAPPENED? HE SAID TOWARDS THE END OF HIS LIFE.

SIMPSON CALLED JUICED. THIS IS A THING THAT ACTUALLY EXISTED. THIS IS PUNK??D FEATURING O.J. SIMPSON ALMOST 10 YEARS AFTER HE SET FIRE TO THE ZEITGEIST WITH HIS MURDER TRIAL AT A TIME WHEN 78 PERCENT OF AMERICANS BELIEVED HE PROBABLY OR DEFINITELY WAS GUILTY. THIS IS THE MOST NOTORIOUS MAN IN AMERICA GOING UNDERCOVER AT A FAST FOOD RESTAURANT AND PRETENDING TO MESS UP PEOPLE??S ORDERS CHEEKILY CHIRPING ??YOU??VE BEEN JUICED!?????JUICED? BEING A REFERENCE TO HIS NICKNAME AS A FOOTBALL PLAYER. THIS IS FLABBERGASTING. THIS IS FASCINATING. THIS IS SO MUCH WORSE THAN YOU COULD EVEN IMAGINE. YOU REALLY NEED TO WATCH IT. JUICED WAS A ONE-TIME SPECIAL AIRING ON PAY PER VIEW THAT WAS THEN REPURPOSED FOR A SPECIAL-EDITION DVD. THE WEBSITE HOCKING IT STILL EXISTS. YOU CAN VISIT IT?ŸHERE. ??HAS REALITY TV GONE TOO FAR?? THE SITE TEASES UNAWARE IT IS ASKING A RHETORICAL QUESTION. ??YOU BE THE JUDGE.? IT TEASES THE SPECIAL AS STARRING ??THE MOST NOTORIOUS CELEBRITY ON THE PLANET.? ARE YOU CONFUSED? ??YES THAT O.J. SIMPSON!? OH. SHOULD YOU THINK THAT THIS PEAK MOMENT IN CULTURE WAS ABOVE CAPITALIZING ON SIMPSON??S REPUTATION AS A UM MURDERER YOU NEEDN??T FEAR. ??NO ONE IS SAFE BECAUSE ??THE JUICE?? IS LOOSE? THE SITE PROMISES OMINOUSLY. ????AGAIN.? JUICED WAS PRODUCED BY THE SAME PATRON OF THE ARTS WHO SHEPHERDED BUM FIGHTS AND BACKYARD WRESTLING TO THE EARTH. THIS WOULD BE HIS CROWNING ACHIEVEMENT. THE IDEA IS STRAIGHTFORWARD??ALMOST CHILLINGLY SO. THIS ISN??T AN IMAGE-REHABBING CELEBRITY COMEBACK A CHARMING COMEDY BIT MEANT TO ERASE NEGATIVE FEELINGS THE PUBLIC MAY HAVE ABOUT ITS STAR. IT??S YOUR TYPICAL HIDDEN-CAMERA SHOW. SIMPSON WOULD INFILTRATE SOME ESTABLISHMENT SOMETIMES IN DISGUISE AND SOMETIMES NOT NEEDLING CUSTOMERS TO THEIR BREAKING POINT BEFORE SHOUTING ??YOU??VE BEEN JUICED.? THE PUNCHLINE IS AS OBVIOUS AS YOU SUSPECT AND THAT??S WHAT MAKES THIS WHOLE THING SO DUMBFOUNDING. AS HARMON LEON WHO PLAYED SIMPSON??S SIDEKICK ON THE SHOW RELATES THE TYPICAL CHRONOLOGY: ??A PRANK IS PULLED OJ SIMPSON POPS OUT AND GOES ??YOU'VE BEEN JUICED?? AT WHICH POINT THE PERSON PRANKED GOES ??HEY AREN??T YOU THAT GUY WHO MURDERED THOSE PEOPLE?! YOUR WIFE AND THAT OTHER GUY?!??? YOU??VE BEEN PUNK??D! BY THAT GUY WE STILL THINK IS PROBABLY A KILLER. LEON AND JUICED GAINED SOME CULT NOTORIETY LAST YEAR WHEN LEON WROTE A?ŸCOLUMN FOR VICE ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE AND THEN WAS INTERVIEWED BY?ŸTHIS AMERICAN LIFE ABOUT IT. THERE ARE MULTITUDES OF CAN??T-MAKE-THIS-SHIT-UP GEMS IN LEON??S TESTIMONIAL WHICH READS ALMOST AS A SURVIVOR??S MEMOIR OF SORTS. ON HIS FIRST DAY OF PRODUCTION FOR EXAMPLE LEON WAS STERNLY WARNED BY HIS PRODUCER ??YOU KNOW HARMON WE REALLY CAN??T MENTION?? THE MURDERS.? HIS RECOUNTING OF HOW ABYSMAL SIMPSON WAS AT IMPROV??A KEY TALENT FOR THE STAR OF A HIDDEN-CAMERA SHOW??IS HYSTERICAL ABOUT AS HYSTERICAL AS HIS RECOLLECTION OF HOW MOST OF THE INNOCENT VICTIMS REACTED TO SIMPSON IS HORRIFYING. ??I THOUGHT OH MAN THERE??S GOING TO BE LIKE JUST OUTRAGED PEOPLE OR PEOPLE FREAKING OUT? LEON TOLD THIS AMERICAN LIFE REPORTER NANCY UPDIKE. ??AND THAT WAS ACTUALLY THE MOST MIND-NUMBING PART ABOUT THE TWO-WEEK PRODUCTION WAS THAT PEOPLE JUST WERE ACTUALLY THRILLED WHEN THEY FIND OUT THEY??D BEEN JUICED BY O.J.? FOR GOSSIP HOUNDS TOO IT??S MORE THAN WORTH READING?ŸLEON??S ACCOUNT FOR HIS REGALING OF SIMPSON??S BEHAVIOR ON SET. KEY LINE: ??O.J. WAS COMPLETELY SHITFACED.? BUT REALLY THE GLORY IS IN WATCHING THIS BEAUTIFUL SHAMEFUL DISASTER. THIS PINNACLE OF TRASH TV THAT SIMPLY DOES NOT HAVE ITS DUE. THIS TREASURE THAT IS JUICED. IT OPENS WITH A RAP VIDEO. YES A RAP VIDEO. O.J. SIMPSON IS DRESSED LIKE A PIMP SURROUNDED BY TOPLESS DANCERS WHO GYRATE ALL OVER HIM. HE SPITS LYRICS: ??DON??T YOU KNOW THERE??S NO STOPPING THE JUICE / WHEN I??M ON THE FLOOR I??M LIKE A LION ON THE LOOSE / BETTER SHOOT ME WITH A TRANQUILIZER DART / DON??T BE STUPID I??M NOT A SIMPSON NAMED BART.? THE VIDEO THEN SHOWS SIMPSON IN A RECORDING BOOTH FOR SOME REASON WEARING A CURLY WIG AND??YES FOR THE LOVE OF GOD??A WIFE BEATER. CUT BACK TO THE DANCING HOS. IN THE FIRST SKETCH SIMPSON PRETENDS TO WORK AT THE DRIVE THRU WINDOW OF A FAST FOOD JOINT. ??IF I PULLED UP TO A WINDOW WHERE O.J. SIMPSON WAS AT I WOULD NOT EAT THAT FOOD? SAYS ONE OF HIS ACCOMPLICES TO THE CAMERA. ANOTHER: ??I WOULD GO TO ANOTHER RESTAURANT.? THAT SIMPSON IS A SCARY PERSON IS VERY MUCH THE JOKE. OH HIJINX ENSUE. HE TAKES A SIP FROM A DRINK BEFORE GIVING IT TO A CUSTOMER TO MAKE SURE THERE??S ENOUGH ICE IN IT. HE ASKS AN OVERWEIGHT WOMAN IF SHE??S SURE SHE WANTS FRIES. (GET IT? BECAUSE SHE??S FAT.) IN ONE BIT WHERE HE BULLIES AN EMPLOYEE HE SAYS OH-SO CHARMINGLY ??I THINK HE??S A RETARD.? HE RUBS CHEESE ON HIS APRON BEFORE SERVING THE BURGER TO A CUSTOMER. HEALTH CODE VIOLATIONS! YOU??VE BEEN JUICED! (WARNING: BELOW VIDEO NSFW.) IN ANOTHER SKETCH HE DRESSES AS A HOMELESS MAN AND SELLS ORANGES ON THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY??ORANGES FROM O.J.??AS??A META-COMMENTARY ON HIS FALLEN CELEBRITY? (JUST KIDDING THERE??S NO DEEP MEANING HERE.) HE PRETENDS TO BE HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH A GUY??S GIRLFRIEND. HE PUTS ON PROSTHETICS TO TRANSFORM INTO AN OLD WHITE MAN WHO WANTED TO CALL A BINGO GAME BEFORE HE DIED. THE SKETCH IS CALLED ??B-I-N-G-O.J.? THROUGH IT ALL HE TELLS PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN JUICED THAT HE??S THE GUY FROM MOVIES LIKE NAKED GUN OR FROM THE FOOTBALL FIELD. YES O.J. THAT??S WHAT THEY KNOW YOU FROM. THE ONE TRULY FUNNY BIT IN THAT IT IS SERIOUSLY UNCOMFORTABLE INVOLVES SIMPSON PRETENDING TO ATTEND AN OPEN HOUSE. LEON PLAYING THE HOMEOWNER KEEPS CALLING SIMPSON DANNY GLOVER. SIMPSON PERHAPS FORGETTING IT??S ALL STAGED GETS VISIBLY ANGRY. WHEN SOMEONE AT THE OPEN HOUSE BREAKS A VASE LEON ASKS SIMPSON IF IT WAS HIM. HE SAYS IT WASN??T: ??I??VE BEEN BLAMED FOR ENOUGH SHIT.? AT ONE POINT A WOMAN IN THE BACKYARD BEGINS JUMPING ON A TRAMPOLINE TOPLESS. THERE??S NO REASON FOR THIS. SHE JUST IS. TOPLESS WOMEN FACTOR PROMINENTLY INTO JUICED DANCING ON SIMPSON IN ACID TRIP MONTAGES THAT PLAY BEFORE AND AFTER EACH SKETCH AS THE SHOW TRANSITIONS BETWEEN THEM. YOU MAY STARE DUMBFOUNDED BUT IT??S ALL A WARM-UP FOR WHAT IS THE SHOW??S MOST EXCELLENT AND MOST SHOCKING BIT. SIMPSON GOES TO A USED CAR LOT IN LAS VEGAS AND ATTEMPTS TO SELL A USED WHITE BRONCO. THERE??S A BULLET HOLE IN IT. HE AUTOGRAPHS THE BRONCO RIGHT ABOVE IT. HIS PITCHES TO PROSPECTIVE CUSTOMERS READ AS IF FROM A SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE SKIT. ??THIS IS A COLLECTOR??S ITEM? HE SAYS. ??IT WAS GOOD FOR ME. GOT ME OUT OF HARM??S WAY.? AND THEN THE LINE THAT WILL HAVE YOU FUMBLING TO LIFT YOUR JAW OFF ITS NEWLY PERMANENT RESIDENCE ON THE FLOOR: ??I CAN GUARANTEE THIS CAR HAS ESCAPEABILITY? HE SAYS. ??IF YOU EVER GET IN TROUBLE AND HAVE TO GET AWAY THIS CAR HAS ESCAPEABILITY.? ACCORDING TO THIS AMERICAN LIFE JUICED WAS NOT A HIT WITH UPDIKE REPORTING THAT FEWER THAN 100 COPIES OF THE DVDS WERE SOLD. IT WAS RELEASED RIGHT AROUND THE TIME WHEN SIMPSON WAS AT WORK ON HIS BOOK IF I DID IT A WORK OF SUCH COLOSSAL CONTROVERSY THAT THE PUBLISHER WHO COMMISSIONED WAS FIRED. SHE SPOKE TO RICK MAHR THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER OF JUICED WHO CONCEDED THAT AMIDST ALL THE UPROAR HE PULLED JUICED FROM CIRCULATION TOO. ALL THESE YEARS LATER HOWEVER HE BEGAN PEDDLING IT AGAIN UNDER THE TITLE UNGLOVED: THE LOST TAPES. HE CONCEDES THOUGH THAT HIS ATTEMPT AT CREATING A REALITY SHOW THAT WOULD MAKE NOISE OVER ALL THE CLUTTER ULTIMATELY FLOPPED WITH A WHIMPER. ??YOU KNOW I??D BE THE FIRST TO SAY IT? MAHR SAYS. ??IT??S NOT EVERYBODY??S??IT??S NOT EVERYBODY??S CUP OF TEA.? IN OTHER WORDS SIR YOU??VE BEEN JUICED.

RADER DIED THURSDAY AFTER FIGHTING PARKINSON??S DISEASE A FAMILY FRIEND TOLD ME. I WROTE ABOUT RADER IN A LONG PROFILE LAST MONTH. AT THE TIME A GROUP OF NEIGHBORHOOD FRIENDS WHO WERE CARING FOR HER EVERY DAY??TAKING RADER TO DOCTORS APPOINTMENTS OUT TO DINNER READING TO HER??HAD ALSO TAKEN UP THE CAUSE OF PUSHING THROUGH A LEGION OF MERIT RECOMMENDATION THAT WAS APPROVED BY RADER??S SENIOR OFFICERS IN 1946. THE WAR DEPARTMENT THOUGH THOUGHT SHE SHOULD GET A LESSER AWARD. RADER PERHAPS HAD TWO STRIKES AGAINST HER. FIRST SHE WAS A WOMAN. SECOND SHE WAS A MEMBER OF THE NEWLY FORMED OFFICE OF STRATEGIC SERVICES THE UNITED STATES?? FIRST CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE AND THE PRECURSOR TO THE CIA. THE OSS DIDN??T HAVE THE CLOUT OF TODAY??S SPY AGENCY. IT SEEMS THAT THOUGH HER SERVICE WAS UNDENIABLY HEROIC THE MILITARY BUREAUCRACY THAT DECIDES WHO GETS AWARDS WASN??T ON HER SIDE. RADER THEN CZECH WAS JUST ONE OF TWO OSS MEMBERS SERVING IN POLAND IN 1945 AND THE ONLY ONE WHO SPOKE POLISH?Ÿ FLUENTLY. THAT MEANT SHE WAS GIVEN THE MOST IMPORTANT ASSIGNMENTS AND THE MOST DANGEROUS ONES. SHE MONITORED RUSSIAN TROOP MOVEMENTS AND GATHERING INFORMATION FROM A NETWORK OF AGENTS. IN ONE HARROWING OPERATION SHE EVADED CAPTURE BY RUSSIAN SECURITY FORCES WHO SHE WAS SURE WOULD HAVE SENT HER TO A PRISON IN SIBERIA NEVER TO BE HEARD FROM AGAIN. RADER LIKE SO MANY MEN AND WOMEN OF HER GENERATION DIDN??T TALK MUCH ABOUT HER WARTIME SERVICE. HER HUSBAND A CELEBRATED WWII AVIATOR WENT ONTO AN ILLUSTRIOUS CAREER AS AN AIR FORCE GENERAL AND HIMSELF WON THE LEGION OF MERIT. BUT RADER KEPT HER STORY MOSTLY TO HERSELF. ONE FRIEND RECENTLY TOLD ME THAT HE WONDERED IF RADER THOUGHT MANY OF THE DETAILS OF HER WORK WERE STILL CLASSIFIED AND THAT SHE SHOULDN'T TALK ABOUT IT EVEN SEVEN DECADES LATER. \WHEN OSS FOUNDER GENERAL WILLIAM DONOVAN SAID THAT OSS PERSONNEL PERFORMED 'SOME OF THE BRAVEST ACTS OF THE WAR' HE MUST HAVE HAD MAJOR STEPHANIE CZECH RADER IN MIND? CHARLES PINCK THE PRESIDENT OF THE OSS SOCIETY TOLD ME THURSDAY?Ÿ MORNING. THE GROUP THROWS AN ANNUAL GALA WHERE CZECH WAS RECENTLY HONORED. ??LIKE MANY OF THOSE WHO SERVED SO HEROICALLY IN THE OSS...SHE WAS NEVER PROPERLY RECOGNIZED FOR HER HEROISM DURING HER LIFETIME. I HOPE THE ARMY WILL AWARD THE LEGION OF MERIT TO HER POSTHUMOUSLY? PINCK SAID. AND IT LOOKS LIKE THEY JUST MIGHT. A SPOKESWOMAN FOR SENATOR MARK WARNER??S OFFICE TOLD ME THAT HE ??WAS TERRIBLY SADDENED TO LEARN ABOUT STEPHANIE RADER??S PASSING. SHE WAS AN EXCEPTIONALLY COURAGEOUS AMERICAN WHO SERVED HER COUNTRY WITH HONOR AND DISTINCTION AND HE WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH FOR THE RECOGNITION THAT SHE DESERVES.? THOUGH SHE WON??T BE HERE TO SEE THAT AWARD I??M LEFT THINKING THAT RADER WANTED IT AND BELIEVED SHE WOULD GET IT. WHEN I MET HER AT THE RECENT OSS GALA SHE WAS TOO FRAIL TO SPEAK. BUT AS PINCK RECOGNIZED HER FROM THE PODIUM AND THE CROWD OF HUNDREDS CAME TO THEIR FEET TO APPLAUD HER AND URGE HER ON IN THE MEDAL CAMPAIGN RADER RAISED UP HER HAND WITH THE HELP OF A FRIEND AND EVER SO SLIGHTLY MADE THE SHAPE OF A FIST PUMPING IT IN THE AIR.

A DOZEN IOWANS IN THEIR 60'S 70'S AND BEYOND NEARLY ALL WHITE-HAIRED AND WEARING GLASSES SHUFFLED INTO THE BASEMENT MEETING ROOM OF THE ESTHERVILLE PUBLIC LIBRARY LAST FRIDAY TO HEAR FROM A SANDERS STAFFER ABOUT SENIORS ISSUES. ESTHERVILLE IS IN EMMET COUNTY LOCATED IN DEEP-RED NORTHWESTERN IOWA A COUNTY THAT HILLARY CLINTON TIED FOR FIRST WITH JOHN EDWARDS IN THE 2008 CAUCUS. YOU COULD BARELY FIND A DEMOGRAPHIC MORE SKEPTICAL OF SANDERS' \POLITICAL REVOLUTION\"" (ASIDE FROM REPUBLICANS OF COURSE) BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHY THEY WERE ALL HERE. AS CAUCUS NIGHT IN IOWA DRAWS NEAR BOTH CAMPAIGNS ARE WORKING HARD TO MOTIVATE THEIR BASE BUT ALSO TO SHORE UP THEIR WEAKNESSES. WITH CLINTON THAT MEANS BLUNTING SANDERS' ADVANTAGE WITH YOUNG PEOPLE ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES. TO ACCOMPLISH THAT CLINTON HAS ALREADY DEPLOYED KATY PERRY AND LENA DUNHAM TO IOWA EVENTS AND IS SENDING SINGER DEMI LOVATO THIS WEEK. ?ŸFOR SANDERS THE GOAL IS TO IMPROVE HIS STANDING AMONG OLDER IOWANS. HE TRAILED CLINTON 56% TO 26% OF LIKELY CAUCUS-GOERS OVER 65 IN THE LATEST DES MOINES REGISTER POLL. TO HELP WITH THIS TASKHAS SANDERS HAS BRUCE KOEPPL. BRUCE ENTERS THE ESTHERVILLE LIBRARY'S MEETING ROOM ON HIS MOTORIZED SCOOTER WITH WALKING CANE WEDGED BETWEEN HIS KNEES NAVIGATING HIS WAY AROUND THE TABLE TO SET UP AT THE FRONT. SPORTING A BEARD AND PONYTAIL BRUCE HAS THE LOOK OF YOUR TYPICAL SANDERS OUTSIDER-TYPE SUPPORTER BUT HE'S ACTUALLY AN OLD PRO AT THIS. BRUCE HAS WORKED ON CAUCUS CAMPAIGNS SINCE HIS COLLEGE DAYS SERVING IN STAFFING ROLES ON TED KENNEDY WALTER MONDALE JOE BIDEN AND PAUL SIMON'S IOWA OPERATIONS. FOR THE PAST 23 YEARS HE'S WORKED FOR AARP ON THEIR ADVOCACY SIDE INCLUDING AS A STATE AND REGIONAL DIRECTOR. HE RETIRED THIS MARCH BUT COULDN'T STAY OUT OF THE POLICY AND POLITICAL WORLD FOR LONG JOINING UP WITH THE SANDERS CAMPAIGN AS A SENIOR ADVISER. TO START OFF THE MEETING BRUCE PLAYS A 9-MINUTE VIDEO OF SANDERS' POSITIONS ON THESE ISSUES. SANDERS HIMSELF NARRATES SPEAKING DIRECTLY TO CAMERA WHILE SLICK GRAPHICS FLASH OVER THE SCREEN TO EXPLAIN SOCIAL SECURITY'S SOLVENCY AND OTHER TOPICS. \""HI THIS IS SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS\"" THE VIDEO BEGINS. \""MUCH OF THE MEDIA OFTEN APPROACHES POLITICS AS IF IT WERE A BASEBALL GAME OR A SOAP OPERA. WHO'S LEADING IN THE LATEST POLL? HOW MUCH MONEY DID A CANDIDATE RAISE? DID SOMEONE SAY SOMETHING REALLY DUMB LAST NIGHT? THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF THE MEDIA THINKS MODERN POLITICS SHOULD BE ABOUT. I DISAGREE. I'M OLD FASHIONED I GUESS.\"" NOTABLY SANDERS BEGINS AND ENDS WITH A CALL TO DISTRIBUTE THE VIDEO TO FRIENDS FAMILY AND NEIGHBORS. THIS WAS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED SCRIPTED AND SHOT FOR ORGANIZING WORK. BRUCE OFTEN LEAVES A DOZEN OR MORE EXTRA DVDS BEHIND. THIS IOWA CAUCUS CYCLE HAS SEEN A WIDE MIX OF STRATEGIES OLD AND NEW FOR WINNING THE ALL-IMPORTANT LEAD-OFF STATE. SOCIAL MEDIA ORGANIZING AND MASSIVE RALLIES FROM SANDERS IN TOWNS LARGE AND SMALL HAS MANY THINKING HIS CAMPAIGN HAS FOUND THE KEY TO TURNING OUT FIRST-TIME CAUCUS-GOERS TO SCORE THE UPSET AGAINST CLINTON. BUT THEY??RE ALSO STICKING WITH TRIED-AND-TRUE ORGANIZING TACTICS LIKE THESE WELL AWAY FROM THE MEDIA SPOTLIGHT TO SEAL THE DEAL. BRUCE BEGINS HIS DISCUSSION BY ASKING THE ATTENDEES WHAT THEY SPENT THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY COST OF LIVING INCREASE ON THIS LAST YEAR. THE ROOM CHUCKLES (THERE WAS NO INCREASE). \""I DON'T REMEMBER BEING ABLE TO BUY A CUP OF COFFEE WITH MINE\"" ONE MAN SAYS. SEVERAL AROUND THE TABLE SHARE THEIR STORIES ON DEALING WITH MEDICARE. ONE MAN'S MOTHER HAD AN EXPENSIVE KNEE OPERATION THAT WAS COVERED BY IT. ANOTHER WAS AMAZED AND FRUSTRATED WITH HOW MUCH PRESCRIPTION DRUGS COST DESPITE BEING CHEAPER IN OTHER COUNTRIES. BRUCE NOTICES A FRAMED PICTURE ON THE WALL OF THREE HORSES PULLING FARM MACHINERY AND SAYS IT REMINDS HIM OF SANDERS: THAT HE'S A WORKHORSE. HE RECOUNTS THE MANY BATTLES SANDERS HAS FOUGHT ON THESE ISSUES AND ARGUES THAT SOMETHING SPECIAL IS HAPPENING IN THIS CAMPAIGN THAT COULD CHANGE WASHINGTON. SOME OF THE ATTENDEES ARE SKEPTICAL. THIS IS STEVE KING COUNTRY AFTER ALL WHERE LOCAL DEMOCRATS HAVE SEEN THEIR CANDIDATES DEFEATED AT THE FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL IN MANY OF THE PAST ELECTION CYCLES. SINGLE PAYER SOUNDS NICE TO THEM BUT THEY KNOW THE REALITY OF THE SHORTCOMINGS OF DEMOCRATIC POLITICS LIKE FEW OTHERS. THEY PEPPER BRUCE WITH QUESTIONS. HOW CAN SANDERS REALLY GET IT DONE? WOULDN'T HE NEED A DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS? WHAT IF HE SELECTED ELIZABETH WARREN AS HIS VICE PRESIDENT TO HAND THE TORCH OFF TO AFTER SOME TIME? THE QUESTIONS AREN'T HOSTILE JUST HONEST AND BRUCE WALKS THEM THROUGH THE POSSIBILITIES IN A CALM AND COLLECTED MANNER. \""WE NEED A CHAMPION TO TAKE ON BIG PHARMA\"" BRUCE ASSERTS SOFTLY HITTING THE TABLE WITH HIS HAND. \""BERNIE HASN'T TAKEN THEIR MONEY ... ON RAISING THE CAP [FOR SOCIAL SECURITY INCOME] IT'S NOT A COMPLICATED FIX. IT'S HAVING THE WILL TO GO FIGHT FOR IT.\"" DESPITE THE TEMPTATION TO TALK ONLY POLITICAL POSITIONING THE GROUP SEEMS TO ENJOY THE ISSUE DISCUSSION. \""THAT'S WHAT BERNIE'S GOT TO DO FORCE THE REPUBLICANS BACK TO TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUES\"" SAYS DALE GREEN A 90-YEAR-OLD RETIREE FROM ESTHERVILLE. \""I'M IMPRESSED BECAUSE HE TALKS ABOUT ISSUES NOT PERSONALITY ... THE PARTIES USED TO BE A LOT MORE SIMILAR. I VOTED FOR DEWEY MY WIFE VOTED FOR TRUMAN IT WASN'T A BIG DEAL. THEY WEREN'T THAT DIFFERENT BACK THEN!\"" CAROL AND JERRY PLOUTH OF ESTHERVILLE CAME TO THE MEETING UNDECIDED EVEN THOUGH THEY BOTH CAUCUSED FOR CLINTON IN 2008. THE PLOUTHS NODDED ALONG TO MANY PARTS OF THE SANDERS VIDEO AND SEEMED ENGAGED WITH THE DISCUSSION. BUT THEY STILL HAD THEIR DOUBTS. \""I THOUGHT IT WAS EDUCATIONAL LOT OF GOOD POINTS. I TOOK A GOOD LONG LOOK AT HIS STAND ON SOCIAL SECURITY THAT'S A BIG SCARE FOR PEOPLE OUR AGE\"" CAROL SAID AFTERWARD. \""I DON'T KNOW THOSE TOP TWO DEMOCRATS ARE A TOSS-UP.\"" \""I WANT THE DEMOCRATS TO GET IN SO BAD BUT I DON'T KNOW IF HE CAN QUITE CUT THE MUSTARD\"" ADDED JERRY. \""I THINK HE'S GOT SOME GOOD IDEAS. MAYBE IF HE CAN GET PEOPLE INTERESTED IN VOTING.\"" BUT BRUCE HAS FOUND PLENTY OF NEW CONVERTS IN THESE MEETINGS BEFORE. SOMETIMES IT JUST TAKES SOME PRODDING FROM THE FAITHFUL. AT A MEETING IN ALGONA EARLIER IN THE DAY A GROUP OF SEVEN GATHERED IN THE LIBRARY'S KITCHEN (RENTAL FEE: $12) NEARLY ALL SANDERS SUPPORTERS ALREADY. THEY WERE THERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION TO DISSEMINATE OUT TO THEIR FRIENDS. \""I BELONG TO TWO SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS IN FENTON\"" VALERIE COLE A 60-YEAR-OLD FROM FENTON SAID AFTER THE MEETING AS SHE STRATEGIZED HOW TO WIN OVER HER FRIENDS. \""YOU GET FAMILIAR WITH THESE LADIES. YOU GO UP FOR COFFEE I FIND OUT A LOT MORE THAT'S WHERE ALL THE GOSSIP IS AT. I CAN LEAVE SOME PACKETS UP THERE.\"" SURPRISINGLY A LOT OF THE OUTREACH WORK WITH OLDER IOWANS IN THESE RURAL COMMUNITIES IS BEING DONE ONLINE. EVERYONE AT THE ALGONA MEETING TALKED ABOUT HOW THEY WOULD SHARE THE INFORMATION ON FACEBOOK. \""WHEN HE FIRST STARTED SAYING THINGS ON FACEBOOK THAT'S WHERE I STARTED PAYING ATTENTION TO HIM\"" COLE SAID OF HOW SHE FIRST CAME TO KNOW ABOUT SANDERS. ON THE SENIORS FRONT SANDERS HIMSELF HAS JUST RECENTLY SWITCHED UP HIS FAMOUSLY FOCUSED ECONOMIC INEQUALITY STUMP SPEECH TO A MORE SOCIAL SECURITY-FOCUSED MESSAGE NEAR THE TOP OF HIS RALLY MESSAGE. BEHIND THE SCENES HOWEVER THIS WORK HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR SOME TIME. BRUCE WILL COMPLETE HIS 15TH OF THESE MEETINGS SOON AND WON'T EVEN VENTURE A GUESS AT HOW MANY MILES HE'S PUT ON HIS VAN. TURNOUT FOR HIS SMALL MEETINGS ONLY RANGE IN THE DOZENS BUT THEY'RE SLOWLY MOVING A DIFFICULT CONSTITUENCY OVER TO SANDERS' SIDE. IT'S AN OLD-FASHIONED APPROACH TO AN OLD-FASHIONED AUDIENCE AND ONE THAT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY. BUT IF YOU READ THE RECENT POLLING IN IOWA SOMETHING IS CLEARLY HAPPENING HERE. AND IF SANDERS CAN WIN OVER JUST A FEW MORE OLDER IOWANS TO HIS CORNER ON CAUCUS NIGHT HE MIGHT PULL OFF THAT UPSET. \""I USED TO BE A HILLARY SUPPORTER BUT I'M NOT ANYMORE? COLE SAID. ??WHEN I GOT THIS STUFF FROM BERNIE ON MY COMPUTER THAT'S WHAT CHANGED MY MIND. WE WAS JUST TELLING US WHAT ACTUALLY WAS GOING ON IN CONGRESS.\"" """,2669.0

TED CRUZ HAS BEEN TWO-FACED ON GOLDMAN SACHS THE GIANT INVESTMENT BANK: EVEN WHILE HE WAS PUBLICLY DECRYING THE BEHEMOTH BANK AS AN AGENT FOR ??CRONY CAPITALISM? HE REPORTEDLY BORROWED AS MUCH AS $1 MILLION FROM THEM TO FINANCE HIS POLITICAL AMBITIONS. CRUZ AND HIS WIFE TOOK OUT A LOW-INTEREST LOAN FROM GOLDMAN SACHS AND ANOTHER FROM CITIBANK WITHOUT THE REQUIRED DISCLOSURE TO THE FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORTED WEDNESDAY. THE TEXAS SENATOR USED THE LOANS TO HELP FINANCE THE 2012 SENATE CAMPAIGN THAT VAULTED HIM ONTO THE NATIONAL POLITICAL STAGE AND POSITIONED HIM FOR HIS CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL RUN. IT??S NOT THE ONLY BENEFIT HE HAS ACCRUED FROM GOLDMAN SACHS: HE WAS COVERED UNDER THE COMPANY??S HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN WHEN HIS WIFE WORKED AT THE BANK AS A VP. THE COVERAGE ONLY EXPIRED LAST YEAR WHEN SHE DECIDED TO TAKE A LEAVE OF ABSENCE FROM THE ORGANIZATION TO HELP WITH HIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. ALL OF THIS MAKES HIS PUBLIC STANCES ON GOLDMAN SACHS APPEAR EVEN MORE HYPOCRITICAL. HE HAS CALLED OUT THE BANK AS BEING ONE OF THE WORST EXAMPLES OF THE NOXIOUS NEXUS BETWEEN WALL STREET AND WASHINGTON. (THE COMPANY RECEIVED $12.9 BILLION FROM THE U.S. TREASURY DURING THE 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS THROUGH THE BAILOUT OF AIG AT THE TIME THE WORLD??S LARGEST INSURANCE COMPANY. THE MONEY WAS LATER RETURNED BUT ONLY AFTER GOLDMAN WAS PUBLICLY EXCORIATED FOR PAYING HUNDREDS OF EMPLOYEES BONUSES OF $1 MILLION OR MORE.) ??GOLDMAN IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST BANKS ON WALL STREET AND MY CRITICISM WITH WASHINGTON IS THEY ENGAGE IN CRONY CAPITALISM.

DRAMA CO-WRITTEN BY I AM CAIT SERIES REGULAR JEN RICHARDS AND ACTOR-WRITER LAURA ZAK IS THAT IT PORTRAYS TRANS WOMEN AS PEOPLE RATHER THAN PLOT POINTS. IN A MEDIA MOMENT OBSESSED WITH ALL THINGS GENDER HER STORY ISN??T JUST ONE OF THE MOST AUTHENTIC PORTRAYALS OF TRANS LIFE IT??S ALSO A DAMN GOOD AND REFRESHINGLY NUANCED TALE ABOUT WOMEN FALLING IN LOVE. RICHARDS A TRANSGENDER ADVOCATE PLAYS VIOLET A TRANS WAITRESS WHO MOVED TO L.A. TO LEAVE BEHIND A PAST THAT SHE PREFERS TO LEAVE UNSPOKEN. HER TRANS FRIEND PAIGE PLAYED BY TRANSTECH CEO ANGELICA ROSS IS A DRIVEN ATTORNEY FOR THE CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATION LAMBDA LEGAL HARBORING A SURPRISING CRUSH ON THE EQUALLY CONFIDENT JAMES (CHRISTIAN OCHOA). THAT LEAVES ALLIE (ZAK) WHO ASKS TO INTERVIEW VIOLET FOR A STORY ON TRANS WOMEN BUT SOON FINDS HERSELF LET??S SAY GETTING CLOSE TO THE STORY MUCH TO THE DISMAY OF HER TRANSPHOBIC FRIEND LISA (CAROLINE WHITNEY SMITH). OVER THE COURSE OF SIX NINE-MINUTE LONG EPISODES DIRECTED BY SYDNEY FREELAND (DRUNKTOWN??S FINEST) THESE THREADS ALL INTERTWINE IN TRUE SERIAL FASHION. HER STORY DOESN??T TRY TO PUSH THE SOCIAL DRAMA GENRE FORWARD??TRUE TO FORM SOME OF THE MOST HEATED SCENES PLAY OUT IN AN OUTDOOR COFFEE SHOP??BUT IT DOESN??T HAVE TO. WHAT??S NEW HERE IS THAT ACTUAL TRANSGENDER ACTORS ARE PLAYING TRANSGENDER PEOPLE WHO AREN??T INSERTED INTO A STORY TO DIE TRAGICALLY OR TO ADD DIVERSITY TO A CAST. INSTEAD HER STORY CHOOSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE RADICAL TRUTH THAT TRANSGENDER PEOPLE LOVE AND ARE LOVED IN RETURN NO MATTER HOW MUCH VIOLENCE AND HATRED THREATENS THEIR COMMUNITY. THIS IS A SHOW ABOUT VIOLET AND PAIGE??WHO THEY ARE WHAT THEY WANT AND WHAT STANDS IN THEIR WAY??NOT A SET OF VERY SPECIAL EPISODES ABOUT TRANS SEX AND DATING. FOR THE UNINITIATED HOWEVER THERE??S PLENTY OF INCIDENTAL EDUCATION TO BE HAD ALONG THE WAY WHILE THE DRAMA UNFOLDS.

IF THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT FOR LESS THAN AN HOUR OF RUNTIME IT IS BUT HER STORY MOSTLY MANAGES TO FIND NATURAL PLACES IN THE STORYLINE FOR ITS COMMENTARY. THIS IS NOT A DOUR MORALISTIC DRAMA ALTHOUGH IT IS OFTEN OF NECESSITY POLITICAL BY WAY OF THE PERSONAL. IN FACT SIMPLY BY HAVING SEX LIVES VIOLET AND PAIGE ARE ALREADY PUSHING THE ENVELOPE FOR TRANS CHARACTERS. IT TOOK TRANSPARENT A WHOLE SEASON AND NOT COINCIDENTALLY THE ADDITION OF TRANS WRITER OUR LADY J TO REALIZE THAT MAYBE MAURA PFEFFERMAN WAS A SEXUAL BEING. SAID THE WRITER IN AN MTV INTERVIEW ??EVERYONE IS GETTING FUCKED IN SEASON ONE EXCEPT MAURA.? HER STORY BY CONTRAST GIVES ITS CHARACTERS SEXUAL DESIRE FROM THE BEGINNING.

PAIGE ON THE OTHER HAND IS EXCLUSIVELY INTERESTED IN MEN BUT AS A HIGH-POWERED FEMALE ATTORNEY WHO IS BOTH BLACK AND TRANSGENDER FACES DATING HURDLES OF HER OWN. NOT ONLY IS THE SHOW UNFLINCHINGLY HONEST ABOUT THE FACT THAT TRANS PEOPLE HAVE SEXUAL DESIRE IT ALSO DARES TO DEPICT TRANS PEOPLE AS OBJECTS OF THAT SAME DESIRE.

IT??S TYPICALLY A DELIGHT! SURPRISING WINNERS. FAMOUS PEOPLE SLURRING THEIR THANK YOUS IN SPEECHES. A LOOSER MORE RIBALD ATMOSPHERE THAT WOULD MAKE THE ACADEMY BLUSH. WHO KNOWS WHAT WILL HAPPEN OR HOW DRUNK JACK NICHOLSON WILL GET. IT??S A HOOT! IT??S THE GOLDEN GLOBES! THIS YEAR? THE GLOBES TOOK ITS REPUTATION TOO SERIOUSLY. OR RATHER TOO FAR.?Ÿ THERE WAS RICKY GERVAIS NEEDLING AND PRODDING AT OUR SHOCK AND TASTE LEVELS PREDICTABLY SETTING SOCIAL MEDIA ON FIRE WHEN HE??D STUMBLE BEER GLASS IN HAND A LITTLE TOO FAR OVER THE LINE. THE WINNERS WEREN??T WTF IN THE CUTESY GOLDEN GLOBES WAY WHERE THEY REWARD THE GROUNDBREAKING BUZZY SHOWS THAT THE EMMYS ARE TOO STAID TO HONOR. THEY WERE WTF IN THE LITERAL ARE-THESE-SERIOUSLY-THE-WINNERS? SENSE. (??GOLDEN GLOBE-WINNING ACTRESS LADY GAGA!?) EVEN THE ATTENDEES AT THE ??NAUGHTIEST AWARDS SHOW? TOOK THE BRANDING TOO LITERALLY. EVERYONE FROM AMY SCHUMER TO HELEN MIRREN TO MARK WAHLBERG TO A VERY IRRITATED TOM HANKS HAD TO SCOLD AND CHASTISE CELEBRITIES IN THE BALLROOM FOR THEIR DISTRACTING CHATTER REFUSAL TO TAKE THEIR SEATS WHEN THE SHOW WAS BACK FROM COMMERCIAL AND FOR GENERALLY BEING INCONSIDERATE MISBEHAVING HOLLYWOOD EGOTISTS LIKE WE EXPECT THEM TO BE.?Ÿ HI HOLLYWOOD. WHEN MARK WAHLBERG IS SUGGESTING THAT MAYBE YOU??RE BEING RUDE SOMETHING??S WRONG. ALL THESE TRANSGRESSIONS COMBINED TO PRODUCE WHAT WAS SIMULTANEOUSLY ONE OF THE MOST SHOCKING AND MOST DULL GOLDEN GLOBES IN A LONG TIME. (THE SHARP SMART WIT OF AMY POEHLER AND TINA FEY WERE SORELY MISSED AS WERE WINNERS THAT MADE EVEN A LICK OF SENSE.) WHAT IS EVERYONE MOST BUZZED ABOUT??Ÿ HERE WERE THE NIGHT??S BUZZIEST MOMENTS.?Ÿ RICKY GERVAIS?? VICIOUS MONOLOGUE ??SHH. SHUT UP YOU DISGUSTING PILL-POPPING SEXUALLY-DEVIANT SCUM.? AND WITH ONE SENTENCE RICKY GERVAIS WAS BACK??AND WE WERE OVER HIM.?Ÿ OH HE DID HIS RICKY GERVAIS THING. HE WAS HIRED TO ROAST THE ROOM TO BITE THE HAND THAT FEEDS HIM AND TO MAKE EVERYONE WATCHING AT HOME GASP AND CLUTCH THEIR PEARLS. WHAT NBC WAS PROBABLY NOT ANTICIPATING HOWEVER IS HOW AGGRESSIVELY THE CELEBRITIES IN THE BALLROOM WERE NOT HAVING ONE BIT OF IT.?Ÿ SOME JOKES WERE LAZY LIKE GAGS ABOUT CAITLYN JENNER??S TRANSITION AND JEFFREY TAMBOR??S ??BRAVERY? ACTING IN TRANSPARENT AND HOW HARD IT MUST BE TO HIDE HIS BALLS IN A DRESS. HA HA? WHO HAD MONEY ON TWO ARGUABLY TRANSPHOBIC JOKES IN THE FIRST THREE MINUTES? (UPDATE: WE COUNTED AT LEAST TWO MORE THE REST OF THE NIGHT.) OTHER BITS WERE SHARPER LIKE WHEN HE RIFFED ON JENNIFER LAWRENCE??S EQUAL PAY CRUSADE TO JOKE THAT HE WAS PAID THE SAME AS TINA FEY AND AMY POEHLER WERE THE YEAR BEFORE. ??IT??S FUNNY BECAUSE IT??S TRUE.? LATER A RIFF ON THE WORTHLESSNESS OF THE GOLDEN GLOBE AS AWARD CULMINATED WITH HIS INSISTENCE THAT HE USES ONE OF THE TROPHIES HE HAS WON AS A SEX TOY: ??TO BE CLEAR THAT WAS A JOKE ABOUT ME SHOVING A GOLDEN GLOBE THAT I WON UP MY ASS. AND THEY ASKED ME TO HOST FOUR TIMES!? WE MADE OUR OWN BED PEOPLE. NOW WE HAVE TO ANGRY-TWEET FROM IT.?Ÿ THAT MEL GIBSON TRAVESTY IT WASN??T A SHOCK PER SE THAT MEL GIBSON APPEARED AT THE GOLDEN GLOBES. THE HOMOPHOBIC MISOGYNISTIC RACIST ANTI-SEMITIC ACTOR WAS ANNOUNCED AS A PRESENTER IN A PRESS RELEASE. PERHAPS IT SHOULDN??T EVEN BE CONSIDERED A SHOCK THAT AN ORGANIZATION AS NOTORIOUSLY STAR AND FAME OBSESSED AS THE HOLLYWOOD FOREIGN PRESS WOULD TURN A BLIND EYE TO SUCH BEHAVIOR AND GIVE GIBSON THE EQUIVALENT OF AN ACQUITTAL FOR HIS PAST MISDEEDS: AN INVITE TO THE INDUSTRY??S BIGGEST PARTY. NO WHAT SHOCKED WAS THE TONE-DEAF WAY GERVAIS?? RIBBING OF HIM WAS LAID OUT SO THAT WE MIGHT FEEL SLIGHTLY BAD FOR GIBSON??AND IF NOT AT LEAST NOD APPROVINGLY AT WHAT A GOOD SPORT HE WAS BEING BY ALLOWING HIMSELF TO BE MOCKED BY THE ACERBIC HOST. GIBSON EVEN HAD HIS CHANCE AT SOME REDEMPTIVE ONE-LINERS. THE AUDIENCE DIDN??T KNOW WHETHER TO LAUGH OR RUN SCREAMING.?Ÿ THE THING EVERYONE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT NO DOUBT WAS THE PETULANT GIDDINESS WITH WHICH GERVAIS ASKED GIBSON WHICH WAS BLEEPED ON LIVE TV ??WHAT THE FUCK DOES SUGAR TITS EVEN MEAN?? THE WHOLE THING WAS JUST GROSS AND INEXCUSABLE.?Ÿ JONAH HILL AND CHANNING TATUM'S REVENANT BEAR BIT THERE WAS A SOLID GIMMICK IN CHANNING TATUM AND JONAH HILL??S OVERLONG BIT THAT HAD HILL PRETENDING TO BE THE BEAR FROM THE REVENANT SEIZING A BIG HOLLYWOOD MOMENT AFTER BEING OVERSHADOWED BY LEONARDO DICAPRIO ON THE PRESS TOUR.?Ÿ WHATEVER POTENTIAL THERE WAS FOR THE BIT HOWEVER WAS COMPLETELY LOST BECAUSE WE COULDN??T HEAR A SINGLE JOKE. ROUGHLY EVERY OTHER SENTENCE HILL SAID WAS BLEEPED ON LIVE TV LEAVING US WITH THE IMAGE OF JONAH HILL IN A BEAR COSTUME MOUTHING WORDS IN COMPLETE SILENCE. IT WAS UNBEARABLE. (GET IT? BECAUSE HE WAS A BEAR? I??M HERE ALL NIGHT. AND ARGUABLY FUNNIER THAN THIS BIT.) THE CONSTANT CURSING REMEMBER WHEN FAMOUS PEOPLE USED TO BE CLASSY ENOUGH TO RESIST CURSING WHEN THEY WERE ON LIVE TV? AFTER TONIGHT I DON??T. FOLLOWING HILL??S ENTIRELY BLEEPED SKETCH THE BIG PUNCHLINE TO AMY SCHUMER??S BIT WITH JENNIFER LAWRENCE WAS SILENCED BECAUSE OF PROFANITY. BLINDSPOT STAR JAMIE ALEXANDER MAKING HER BIG GOLDEN GLOBES DEBUT CURSED AT A FAULTY TELEPROMPTER: ??WHO??S TYPING THIS SHIT?? THEN OF COURSE THERE WAS THE BIGGEST CENSORING OF THE NIGHT: GERVAIS?? MONEY LINE TO MEL GIBSON WHICH GERVAIS PROUDLY UNBLEEPED LATER ON TWITTER FOR THOSE WHO COULDN??T HEAR WHAT HE SAID THE FIRST TIME OR WERE BAD AT LIP READING. THE MARTIAN AND THE REVENANT WIN BEST PICTURE TWITTER??S 140-CHARACTER COMEDIANS WERE HAVING AS MUCH OF A FIELD DAY AS RICKY GERVAIS WHO WOULD NOT LET IT GO WITH THE MARTIAN??S COMPETING AND EVENTUALLY WINNING TWO AWARDS IN THE COMEDY OR MUSICAL RACES.

TO CELEBRATE ALL OF IT AT THE END OF HER SPEECH SHE THRUST HER GOLDEN GLOBE IN THE AIR WITH ALL THE FERVOR OF EVERYONE WHO WANTED TO SHOVE IT UP GERVAIS?? ASS.?Ÿ MOZART IN THE JUNGLE DOMINATES TV COMEDY CATEGORIES AMAZON??S POLITE LITTLE ROMANTIC DRAMEDY ABOUT PEOPLE WHO PLAY IN AN ORCHESTRA ISN??T NECESSARILY A BAD SHOW. IT IS HOWEVER THE WORST SHOW OF THE SIX THAT WERE NOMINATED FOR BEST TV COMEDY.

HOW WRONG WE WERE. THE HISTRIONIC SOBBING GAGA UNLEASHED AFTER HER ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MORE CONVINCING THAN ANY HORROR STORY PERFORMANCE AND YOU??RE A PSYCHIC HERO IF YOU THOUGH ??JOHN PATRICK SHANLEY'S MOONSTRUCK? WAS GETTING A NAME DROP TONIGHT.?Ÿ WAS IT ALL WORTH IT FOR THIS VINE OF LEONARDO DICAPRIO LOOKING AS IF HE HAD SEEN THE DEVIL HIMSELF AND RECOIL WITH CRIPPLING FEAR AFTER GAGA BRUSHED HIS NECK WHILE WALKING BY HIM?

THE TITANIC CO-STARS HAVE BEEN HEARTWARMINGLY CLOSE OVER THE YEARS (THINKING ABOUT WINSLET??S SHOUT-OUT TO DICAPRIO DURING HER 2009 REVOLUTIONARY ROAD SPEECH STILL MAKES ME CRY) AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THEY??LL BE SHOWING UP TO THE AFTER PARTY TOGETHER WITH GOLD TROPHIES IN THEIR HANDS. WINSLET WAS SUCH A SURPRISE WIN FOR HER WORK IN STEVE JOBS??SHE??S SO SO GOOD IN IT AND I LOVE THIS FILM BUT PUNDITS THOUGHT IT WASN??T HER YEAR??THAT SHE EVEN APPEARED TO WHISPER AN APOLOGY TO PRESUMED FRONTRUNNER ALICIA VIKANDER WHEN HER NAME WAS ANNOUNCED: ??I??M SO SORRY.? AND WHILE DEATH AND TAXES ARE THE ONLY THINGS MORE INEVITABLE THAT DICAPRIO??S REVENANT WIN KUDOS TO YOU IF YOU HAD AN INCLINATION THAT YOU??D HEAR THE PHRASE ??SUBMERGED DEEP IN NATURE IN ALL OF ITS COMPLICATIONS AND ALL THE BEAUTY IT GAVE US CINEMATICALLY? TONIGHT.

THE 31-YEAR-OLD CREATOR OF THE NETFLIX ANIMATED SERIES BOJACK HORSEMAN IS IN TOWN FOR SF SKETCHFEST THE ANNUAL SKETCH COMEDY FESTIVAL NOW IN ITS 15TH YEAR. BACK IN THE DAY BOB-WAKSBERG PERFORMED AT THE FESTIVAL AS A MEMBER OF THE NEW YORK-BASED OLDE ENGLISH COMEDY GROUP BUT THIS TIME HE??S HERE AS A BIG TIME TV SHOWRUNNER. SETTLING INTO THE BAR AT HIS JAPANTOWN HOTEL HE ORDERS A ROOT BEER BECAUSE HE??S ON ??VACATION.? BOJACK HORSEMAN WHICH WILL STREAM ITS THIRD SEASON THIS SUMMER IS NOT AN EASY SHOW TO DESCRIBE. ON THE ONE HAND IT??S A SILLY AND SOMETIMES CRUDE CARTOON ABOUT A WASHED-UP FORMER SITCOM STAR WHO JUST HAPPENS TO BE A HORSE. HE LIVES IN AN ALTERNATE-UNIVERSE VERSION OF HOLLYWOOD WHERE PERSONIFIED ANIMALS COEXIST WITH HUMANS. ON THE OTHER HAND IT IS A DARK EXAMINATION OF HEAVY ISSUES LIKE DEPRESSION ADDICTION AND LONELINESS IN A BUSINESS WHERE ALL THAT MATTERS IS YOUTH AND BANKABILITY. AS THE VOICE OF THE TITLE CHARACTER WILL ARNETT PERFECTLY BLENDS THE TWO SIDES OF THIS COIN DELIVERING HILARIOUS ONE-LINERS ONE MINUTE AND DEVASTATINGLY HONEST MOMENTS THE NEXT. SOMEHOW AMIDST ALL OF THIS THERE IS STILL ROOM FOR GAGS ABOUT THE FAILING PENGUIN PUBLISHING COMPANY BEING RUN BY ACTUAL PENGUINS.

AT THAT POINT HOUSE OF CARDS ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK AND THE FOURTH SEASON OF ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT WERE THE THREE BIGGEST SHOWS ON THE STREAMING SERVICE. ??SO I THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT I LIKED ABOUT THOSE SHOWS AND WHAT I THOUGHT THEY DID REALLY WELL AND I TRIED TO MAKE THE PITCH MIRROR THAT EXPERIENCE.? WITH THAT IN MIND BOJACK HAS A SERIAL STRUCTURE IN WHICH CHARACTERS LEARN AND CHANGE AS OPPOSED TO THE CHARACTERS ON SHOWS LIKE THE SIMPSONS AND FAMILY GUY WHICH RESET AFTER EACH EPISODE. DUE TO NETFLIX??S INFAMOUS REFUSAL TO SHARE VIEWER NUMBERS EVEN WITH THE PEOPLE WHO CREATE THEIR SHOWS BOB-WAKSBERG HAS NO IDEA HOW MANY PEOPLE ACTUALLY WATCH BOJACK HORSEMAN. THE ONLY REAL WAY HE CAN TRACK THE AUDIENCE??S EXPERIENCE IS BY FOLLOWING THEIR OFTEN IMPASSIONED REACTIONS ON SOCIAL MEDIA. ??I??M NOT PRIVY TO THE NUMBERS BUT I WOULD GUESS THAT OUR BIGGEST AUDIENCE WE EVER GOT FOR SEASON ONE WAS AFTER SEASON TWO WAS RELEASED? HE SAYS ADDING THAT HE LIKES THAT PEOPLE CAN FIND THE SHOW ??ON THEIR OWN TIME.? ??THAT IS THE IDEA OF NETFLIX? HE SAYS. ??THEY HAVE A LOT OF PATIENCE IN THEIR SHOWS AND AREN??T INTERESTED IN FIRST DAY NUMBERS FIRST WEEK NUMBERS.

EITHER THEY DIDN??T WORK AT ALL OR THEY BLEW UP IN HIS FACE. WHICH BRINGS US TO THE IDEA OF A SO-CALLED ARTICLE V CONVENTION ASSEMBLED FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROPOSING AMENDMENTS TO THE U.S. CONSTITUTION AN IDEA CURRENTLY ENJOYING SOME VOGUE AT BOTH ENDS OF THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM. ON THE LEFT A GROUP FOUNDED BY LIBERAL TV HOST CENK UYGUR IS PUSHING A CONVENTION AIMED AT OVERTURNING THE SUPREME COURT??S HATED CITIZENS UNITED DECISION AND DECLARING THAT FROM NOW ON CORPORATIONS SHOULD STOP HAVING RIGHTS OR AT LEAST NOT A RIGHT TO SPEND MONEY SPREADING POLITICAL OPINIONS. FOUR LIBERAL STATES??CALIFORNIA VERMONT ILLINOIS AND NEW JERSEY??HAVE SIGNED ON TO THIS IDEA. ON THE RIGHT THE LONGSTANDING PROPOSAL FOR A CONVENTION TO DRAFT A BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT HAS AT TIMES COME WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE OF THE REQUISITE TWO-THIRDS OF STATE LEGISLATURES NEEDED TO TRIGGER THE IDEA. AND FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS TALK SHOW HOST MARK LEVIN HAS BEEN CAMPAIGNING FOR A CONVENTION WITH BROADER CONSERVATIVE GOALS AN IDEA THAT GOT A BOOST WHEN FLORIDA SENATOR MARCO RUBIO RECENTLY ENDORSED IT CITING ??WASHINGTON??S REFUSAL TO PLACE RESTRICTIONS ON ITSELF.? RUBIO??S SPECIFICS ARE STILL SKETCHY??TERM LIMITS FOR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND SUPREME COURT JUSTICES WOULD BE PART OF IT??BUT TEXAS REPUBLICAN GOV. GREG ABBOTT HAS NOW JUMPED IN WITH A DETAILED ??TEXAS PLAN? OF NINE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS MOSTLY AIMED AT WRESTING VARIOUS POWERS BACK FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO THE STATES. SOME OF THESE IDEAS ARE BETTER THAN OTHERS??GOV. ABBOTT??S 92-PAGE REPORT (PDF) IS RATHER ERUDITE AND LAYS OUT ITS ARGUMENTS SKILLFULLY EVEN IF I DO NOT FIND ALL OF THEM SOUND??BUT EVERY SUCH SCHEME TO STAGE AN ARTICLE V CONVENTION SHOULD COME WITH A GIANT ACME BRAND STENCILED ON ITS SIDE. IF IT DOESN??T JUST SIT THERE DOING NOTHING IT??S APT TO BLOW UP ON THE SPOT. THE DETONATION THAT SKEPTICS MOST FEAR IS WHAT??S CALLED A RUNAWAY CONVENTION IN WHICH THE DELEGATES CALLED TOGETHER TO SAY INSTALL TERM LIMITS OR REVAMP CAMPAIGN FINANCE DECIDE TO VENTURE INTO OTHER AREAS AS WELL AND PERHAPS START PROPOSING WHATEVER NEW AMENDMENTS THEY THINK MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA. HENCE JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA??S BRUSQUE DISMISSAL: ??I CERTAINLY WOULD NOT WANT A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION. WHOA! WHO KNOWS WHAT WOULD COME OUT OF IT?? SOME RESPECTED SCHOLARS WHO FAVOR A CONVENTION ARGUE THAT STRICT INSTRUCTIONS WOULD DETER THE ASSEMBLED DELEGATES FROM VENTURING BEYOND THE VELVET ROPE. BUT IF THAT CANNOT BE MADE A LEGAL REQUIREMENT IT WINDS UP MORE LIKE AN HONOR CODE. ??CONGRESS MIGHT TRY TO LIMIT THE AGENDA TO ONE AMENDMENT OR TO ONE ISSUE BUT THERE IS NO WAY TO ASSURE THAT THE CONVENTION WOULD OBEY? WROTE THE LATE CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN BURGER. DON??T BELIEVE SCALIA OR BURGER? GO AHEAD AND READ THE INSTRUCTION KIT FOR A CONVENTION SUCH AS IT IS IN ARTICLE V OF THE U.S. CONSTITUTION. IT??S QUITE BRIEF. HERE??S THE FULL RELEVANT TEXT: THE CONGRESS WHENEVER TWO THIRDS OF BOTH HOUSES SHALL DEEM IT NECESSARY SHALL PROPOSE AMENDMENTS TO THIS CONSTITUTION OR ON THE APPLICATION OF THE LEGISLATURES OF TWO THIRDS OF THE SEVERAL STATES SHALL CALL A CONVENTION FOR PROPOSING AMENDMENTS WHICH IN EITHER CASE SHALL BE VALID TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES AS PART OF THIS CONSTITUTION WHEN RATIFIED BY THE LEGISLATURES OF THREE FOURTHS OF THE SEVERAL STATES OR BY CONVENTIONS IN THREE FOURTHS THEREOF AS THE ONE OR THE OTHER MODE OF RATIFICATION MAY BE PROPOSED BY THE CONGRESS?? NOTE WHAT THIS DOES *NOT* SAY. IT SAYS NOT A WORD EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZING THE STATES CONGRESS OR SOME COMBINATION OF THE TWO TO CONFINE THE SUBJECT MATTER OF A CONVENTION. IT SAYS NOT A WORD ABOUT WHETHER CONGRESS IN CALCULATING WHETHER THE REQUISITE 34 STATES HAVE CALLED FOR A CONVENTION MUST (OR MUST NOT) AGGREGATE CALLS FOR A CONVENTION ON SAY A BALANCED BUDGET WITH DIFFERENTLY WORDED CALLS ARISING FROM RELATED OR PERHAPS EVEN UNRELATED TOPICS. IT SAYS NOT A WORD PRESCRIBING THAT THE MAKE-UP OF A CONVENTION AS MANY CONSERVATIVES IMAGINE WILL BE ONE-STATE-ONE-VOTE (AS ALASKA AND WYOMING MIGHT HOPE) OR WHETHER STATES WITH LARGER POPULATIONS SHOULD BE GIVEN LARGER DELEGATIONS (AS CALIFORNIA AND NEW YORK WOULD SURELY ARGUE). DOES CONGRESS OR PERHAPS THE SUPREME COURT GET TO RESOLVE THESE QUESTIONS??THE SAME CONGRESS AND SUPREME COURT THAT THE PROCESS IS AIMED AT DOING AN END RUN AROUND? IF THE SUPREME COURT RESOLVES THEM DOES IT DO SO ONLY AT THE VERY END OF THE PROCESS AFTER YEARS OF NATIONAL DEBATE HAVE BEEN SPENT IN DEVISING AMENDMENTS THAT WE FIND OUT AFTER THE FACT WERE NOT GENERATED IN PROPER FORM? JUSTICE BURGER DESCRIBED THE WHOLE PROCESS AS ??A GRAND WASTE OF TIME.? ONE REASON IS THAT AFTER ADVOCATES GET THE PROCESS ROLLING BY CONVINCING TWO-THIRDS OF STATES OR 34 ITSELF A FAIRLY DEMANDING NUMBER THE AMENDMENTS THAT EMERGE FROM A CONVENTION DO NOT GET RATIFIED UNLESS THREE-QUARTERS OF STATES RATIFY OR 38 A QUITE DEMANDING NUMBER. PUT DIFFERENTLY IT TAKES ONLY 13 STATES TO REFUSE TO ACT TO KILL ANY OF THESE IDEAS BAD OR GOOD IN THE END. SORRY CENK AND MARCO BUT SO LONG AS WE HAVE A NATION FAIRLY CLOSELY DIVIDED BETWEEN BLUE AND RED SENTIMENT THERE WILL BE AT LEAST 13 STATES SKEPTICAL OF SOME SYSTEMIC CHANGE SO BIG THAT YOU HAD TO GO AROUND THE BACKS OF BOTH CONGRESS AND THE SUPREME COURT TO PULL IT OFF. IF YOU??RE A PROGRESSIVE WHO THINKS THE POPULIST WINDS BLOW ONLY IN YOUR FAVOR REFLECT FOR A MOMENT ON THE SUCCESS OF DONALD TRUMP. IF YOU??RE A CONSERVATIVE TO WHOM RADIO CALL-INS RESOUND AS THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE CONSIDER THAT STATE LEGISLATURES CONFRONTED WITH THE HARD LEGAL ISSUES A CONVENTION WOULD RAISE MIGHT TURN FOR ADVICE AND ASSISTANCE TO ELITE LAWYERS (YIKES) OR EVEN LAW PROFESSORS (DOUBLE YIKES). FINALLY WE SHOULDN??T ASSUME??AS DO SOME OF GOV. ABBOTT??S CO-THINKERS??THAT MOST STATE GOVERNMENTS ARE AS EAGER AS TEXAS TO CURTAIL THE POWERS OF THE FEDS. ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CONSERVATIVE BOOKS ON FEDERALISM LATELY GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR MICHAEL GREVE??S THE UPSIDE-DOWN CONSTITUTION SHEDS LIGHT ON THIS. CONSERVATIVES TELL A CAMPFIRE STORY OF HOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GOT BIG BY TAKING POWER AWAY FROM THE STATES. BUT IN HIS (ADMITTEDLY LONG AND COMPLICATED) BOOK GREVE ARGUES THAT THE TRUTH IS CLOSER TO THE OPPOSITE. WHETHER IN SPENDING PROGRAMS REGULATIONS SUBSIDIES YOU NAME IT ALMOST EVERY BIG EXPANSION OF FEDERAL POWER HAS BEEN SKILLFULLY DESIGNED AS A DEAL THAT CUTS STATE POLITICAL ELITES INTO SOME OF THE RESULTING FLOW OF POWER AND MONEY??CONSIDER FOR EXAMPLE HOW STATE EDUCATION POLICE ROAD AND ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS HAVE COME TO DEPEND ON WASHINGTON??S LARGESSE. AND WHILE MANY STATES MAY JOIN TEXAS IN SINCERELY GRIPING AT THE BAD END OF THE DEAL??THE ENDLESS PAPERWORK THE UNFUNDED MANDATES??THAT DOESN??T MEAN THEY??D ACTUALLY JOIN GOV. ABBOTT IN RISKING THE CONNECTION. YES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS SLIPPED ITS CONSTITUTIONAL BOUNDS AND YES THAT??S INFURIATING. JUST DON??T CONFUSE A PLAN FOR TALKING WHICH IS WHAT THESE AMOUNT TO WITH A PLAN FOR ACTUALLY CHANGING THINGS AND ALWAYS BEWARE OF A CURE THAT MIGHT KILL THE PATIENT.

THE U.S. U.K. ISRAELI AND IRAQI DRONES ARE ARMED. LIKEWISE SOME ARMED GROUPS HAVE STRAPPED EXPLOSIVES TO THEIR OWN SMALL DRONES TRANSFORMING THEM INTO SEMI-AUTONOMOUS FLYING BOMBS.

IRAQ??S PROPELLER-DRIVEN CH-4 UNVEILED DURING A PUBLICITY TOUR OF ONE OF BAGHDAD??S AIR BASES BY DEFENSE MINISTER KHALED AL-OBAIDI IS ROUGHLY THE SIZE OF A CESSNA PRIVATE PLANE. IT??S BEIJING??S CHEAPER EASIER-TO-ACQUIRE ANSWER TO AMERICA??S ICONIC PREDATOR THE ROBOT THAT LAUNCHED THE CURRENT DRONE WAR WHEN IN ITS UNARMED FORM IT DEPLOYED TO THE BOSNIA CONFLICT IN 1995. SIX YEARS LATER IN OCTOBER 2001 THE FIRST MISSILE-ARMED PREDATOR FIRED AT SUSPECTED MILITANTS IN AFGHANISTAN USHERING IN THE CURRENT ERA OF DRONES WHOSE OPERATORS CAN BOTH SPY ON YOU AND KILL YOU WITH THE PUSH OF A BUTTON. SINCE THEN AMERICA??S FORCE OF SEVERAL HUNDRED ARMED PREDATOR AND REAPER DRONES HAVE KILLED THOUSANDS OF SUSPECTED MILITANTS AND TERRORISTS??AND HUNDREDS OF INNOCENT CIVILIANS??IN AFGHANISTAN IRAQ PAKISTAN YEMEN SOMALIA LIBYA SYRIA AND OTHER CONFLICT ZONES. UNARMED U.S. DRONES HAVE HUNTED FOR AMERICA??S ENEMIES IN CENTRAL AFRICA LATIN AMERICA THE PHILIPPINES AND ELSEWHERE. BUT FEDERAL REGULATIONS AND POLICY MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR ALL BUT THE MOST TRUSTED AMERICAN ALLIES TO ACQUIRE U.S.-MADE DRONES TO SAY NOTHING OF ARMED DRONES. UNABLE TO PURCHASE THE WORLD-STANDARD PREDATOR AND REAPER MANY COUNTRIES HAVE TURNED TO ISRAEL IRAN AND CHINA FOR THEIR ROBOT FIX. TEHRAN BEIJING AND TEL AVIV OFFER A WIDE RANGE OF DRONES AT A COST MUCH LOWER THAN THE LATEST AMERICAN MODELS. THE MILITIA VICTIMS OF IRAQ??S ERRANT JANUARY DRONE STRIKE WERE PART OF THE POPULAR MOBILIZATION FORCE ONE OF THE IRAN-BACKED SHIITE GROUPS THAT HAS BOLSTERED THE BELEAGURED IRAQI ARMY IN BAGHDAD??S 17-MONTH-OLD WAR WITH ISIS. AHMAD AL-ASSADI A SPOKESMAN FOR THE MILITIA GROUP SAID THE FIGHTERS WERE BATTLING ISIS FORCES NEAR THE CITY OF TIKRIT WHEN THE DRONE ARRIVED OVERHEAD AND ITS OPERATORS??MOST LIKELY SITTING IN A TRAILER AT A NEARBY AIR BASE REMOTELY CONTROLLING THE DRONE VIA RADIO??MISTOOK THE SHIITE FIGHTERS FOR MILITANTS. ??THE DRONE STRUCK WITH A FIRST MISSILE AND THEN TWO MORE SEVEN MINUTES LATER? ASSADI SAID. IT??S SAFE TO SAY THE POPULAR MOBILIZATION FORCE WON??T BE THE LAST INNOCENT VICTIMS OF BAGHDAD??S KILLER DRONES. THE ROBOT WAR IN IRAQ AND SYRIA IS ONLY ESCALATING WITH MORE AND MORE ROBOTS ENTERING THE FRAY. A YEAR AGO THE U.S. AIR FORCE HAD HOPED TO GIVE ITS DRONE FORCE A BREAK AFTER 20 YEARS OF UNRELENTING WORK. ??IT??S AT THE BREAKING POINT AND HAS BEEN FOR A LONG TIME? A SENIOR AIR FORCE OFFICIAL TOLD THE DAILY BEAST IN EARLY 2015. BUT VIRTUALLY EVERY U.S. AND ALLIED AIR STRIKE AND GROUND OFFENSIVE IN IRAQ AND SYRIA REQUIRES ROBOTIC SUPPORT. ??WE??RE INVOLVED IN PRETTY MUCH EVERY ENGAGEMENT? COL. JAMES CLUFF COMMANDER OF THE 432ND WING AMERICA??S MAIN DRONE UNIT LOCATED AT CREECH AIR FORCE BASE JUST NORTH OF LAS VEGAS TOLD THE DAILY BEAST IN JUNE. THE PENTAGON REALIZED IT HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO DOUBLE DOWN ON DRONE OPS ADDING MORE ROBOTS MORE SQUADRONS TO MAINTAIN THEM AND MORE HUMAN CONTROLLERS??INCLUDING FOR THE FIRST TIME NON-OFFICER ENLISTED OPERATORS AND CIVILIAN CONTRACTORS. THE $3 BILLION EXPANSION PLAN IS ??AN ATTEMPT TO NORMALIZE OPERATIONS AND ENSURE LONG-TERM MISSION SUCCESS? THE AIR FORCE EXPLAINED IN A DECEMBER STATEMENT. AMERICA??S DRONE ESCALATION IS RUNNING HEADLONG INTO SIMILAR PLANS BY ITS ALLIES AND RIVALS. THERE ARE SO MANY ROBOTS FLYING OVER IRAQ AND SYRIA THAT MANNED PLANES NEARLY COLLIDE WITH THEM WITH ALARMING FREQUENCY. IN OCTOBER A RUSSIAN SUKHOI BOMBER FLEW DIRECTLY UNDERNEAT WHAT APPEARED TO BE A U.S. PREDATOR DURING A MISSION OVER SYRIA. THE RUSSIAN CREW SHOT VIDEO OF THE DRONE AND SHORTLY THEREAFTER IGOR KONASHENKOV A KREMLIN SPOKESMAN COMPLAINED OF OVERCROWDING IN SYRIAN SKIES. ??OUR AMERICAN COLLEAGUES DO NOT SEEM TO GRASP THE SERIOUSNESS OF THIS ISSUE? KONASHENKOV SAID. THAT SAME MONTH WASHINGTON AND MOSCOW AGREED TO COORDINATE THEIR FLIGHTS OVER SYRIA TO AVOID A COLLISION??OR WORSE A MISUNDERSTANDING DRAWING U.S. AND RUSSIAN FORCES INTO COMBAT WITH EACH OTHER. MOST DRONE OPERATORS DO NOT PUBLICIZE HOW OFTEN THEIR ROBOTS FLY OR WHERE BUT THERE??S AT LEAST ONE WAY TO VERIFY A DRONE??S PRESENCE OVER THE BATTLEFIELD??WHEN IT CRASHES OR GETS SHOT DOWN. THE FACT THAT ROBOTS FALL TO THE GROUND ALMOST MONTHLY IN IRAQ AND SYRIA IS INDICATIVE OF THE SHEER VOLUME OF ROBOT FLIGHTS IN THE TWO COUNTRIES. IN OCTOBER TWO U.S. PREDATORS CRASHED IN IRAQ AND TURKEY WHILE SUPPORTING THE WAR ON ISIS. THE SAME MONTH TURKISH FORCES SHOT DOWN A DRONE??POSSIBLY RUSSIAN??THAT STRAYED OVER SYRIA??S BORDER WITH TURKEY. AN AMERICAN ROBOT CRASHED IN IRAQ IN JUNE AND ANOTHER WENT DOWN IN SYRIA IN MARCH. IRAN MEANWHILE HAS LOST POTENTIALLY DOZENS OF DRONES IN IRAQ AND SYRIA INCLUDING AN ABABIL 3??AKIN TO A PREDATOR??THAT ISIS CLAIMED TO HAVE SHOT DOWN NEAR THE IRAQI CITY OF SAMARRA IN JANUARY. THE GROWING RANKS OF DRONE OPERATORS SHOULD GET USED TO THE CHAOS. AS MORE AND MORE PILOTLESS FLYING MACHINES DEPLOY IN IRAQ AND SYRIA AND MORE AND MORE ARE PACKING WEAPONS THE CRASHES SHOOT-DOWNS NEAR-MISSES AND ACCIDENTAL KILLINGS ARE ONLY GOING TO BECOME BIGGER PROBLEMS. ,5725.0

DURING AVERY??S TRIAL THEY ADOPTED A GOOD COP/BAD COP ROUTINE??IRONIC GIVEN THAT THEIR CHIEF DEFENSE THEORY WAS THAT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT FRAMED AVERY FOR THE 2005 MURDER AND MUTILATION OF PHOTOGRAPHER TERESA HALBACH WHOSE VEHICLE AND BURNED BONES WERE DISCOVERED ON HIS FAMILY PROPERTY. THE STRANG/BUTING DYNAMIC??ONE GENTLE AND AFFECTING THE OTHER A MASTER OF THE CROSS-EXAM MIC DROP??MADE THE MIDDLE-AGED BESPECTACLED LAWYERS INSTANT ICONS. THEIR SHARED UNDERDOG IDEALISM FOR WHAT MANY PERCEIVE TO BE A BROKEN LEGAL SYSTEM WAS INFECTIOUS AND DOWNRIGHT AWE-INSPIRING MORE SO IN THE AFTERMATH OF AVERY??S CONVICTION. STRANG REMEMBERED THE TOLL THE SIX-WEEK TRIAL TOOK ON HIM. IT WAS SO TAXING HE HAD TO IMMEDIATELY ??UNPLUG? FROM THE WORLD??SO MUCH SO THAT HE NEVER CAUGHT THE SUBSEQUENT TRIAL OF AVERY??S NEPHEW BRENDAN DASSEY UNTIL HE BINGE-WATCHED?ŸMAKING A MURDERER?ŸHIMSELF. ?Ÿ ??I??D BEEN THERE AND I??D LOST THE CASE? HE RECALLED A NOTE OF SADNESS IN HIS VOICE. ??PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ASKING ME ??IS IT COOL TO WATCH YOURSELF ON [MAKING A MURDERER]???

BUTING MEANWHILE HAS BEEN OVERSEAS AS THE DOCUSERIES AND AVERY CASE HAS BLOWN UP AND BECOME A NATIONAL OBSESSION.

STRANG ALL BUT BLUSHES THROUGH THE PHONE WHEN I MENTION HIS LEGIONS OF INTERNET DEVOTEES. HE STAYS OFF SOCIAL MEDIA BUT GETS THE MEMES AND ARTICLES WHEN FRIENDS TEASINGLY EMAIL THEM OVER. MAKING A MURDERER FANS ARE SO OBSESSED WITH THE SERIES THAT HE??S GOTTEN SEVERAL INQUIRIES FROM IRISH REPORTERS ABOUT A HURLING STATUE SEEN IN SOME OF HIS ON-CAMERA INTERVIEWS SITTING CURIOUSLY IN HIS OFFICE. WELL MYSTERY SOLVED: ??THE ANSWER TO THAT IS THAT THERE??S A WONDERFUL CRIMINAL DEFENSE LAWYER IN MILWAUKEE WHO??S LONG BEEN A FRIEND OF MINE FOR OVER 31 YEARS NOW AND HE GAVE ME THAT AS A PRESENT AT SOME POINT? STRANG SAID. ??I??VE NEVER SEEN A HURLING MATCH OR WHAT WOULD YOU CALL THEM? I??VE NEVER PLAYED HURLING??I??VE NEVER BEEN TO IRELAND!? WHEN I FILL HIM IN ON THE STRANGCORE TUMBLR DEDICATED TO HIS STRIKINGLY ??90S FASHION LOOKS AS SEEN ON MAKING A MURDERER??RELAXING ON A COUCH BAREFOOT IN DENIM FOR EXAMPLE??HE LET RIP A BURST OF UPROARIOUS LAUGHTER. ??SOME PEOPLE NEED MORE TO DO? WAS HIS BEMUSED REPLY. ??MOSTLY WHATEVER IT IS I??M JUST LETTING IT GO OVER MY HEAD.? HIS WIFE OF NEARLY THREE YEARS HOWEVER ??THINKS IT??S VERY FUNNY! OTHER THAN WHEN SHE??S LIKE ??THESE WOMEN SHOULD?ŸNOT?ŸMESS WITH ME??? HE LAUGHED. ??WHICH IS TRUE! YOU DO NOT WANT TO MESS WITH HER.? THE ATTENTION THAT MAKING A MURDERER BROUGHT INTO STRANG??S WORLD HAS SPARKED BOTH FAN CLUB FAWNING AND A CHANCE FOR THE STILL-DEDICATED ATTORNEY TO DISCUSS THE ISSUES THAT TROUBLE HIM BOTH IN THE AVERY AND DASSEY CASES AND IN THE CURRENT STATE OF THE AMERICAN JUDICIAL SYSTEM: POVERTY CLASS AND THE EFFECT SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITY PLAYS IN THE LEGAL PROSPECTS OF THE ACCUSED. ??IT??S NOT EVERY CASE THAT RAISES ALL OF THOSE ISSUES OR EVEN SOME OF THEM BUT IT??S MANY CASES THAT RAISE ONE OR MORE? SAID STRANG. ??AND SOME OF THEM ARE JUST PERENNIAL AND UNAVOIDABLE POINTS OF CONFLICT IN THE VALUES WE HOLD. FOR EXAMPLE YOU WANT AN UNRESTRAINED FREE LIVELY PRESS AND MEDIA COVERAGE IN THIS COUNTRY. I DON??T WANT ANY GOVERNMENT RESTRAINTS FUNCTIONALLY ON REPORTING AND JOURNALISM. AT THE SAME TIME WE WANT A FAIR TRIAL FOR EVERYONE WHO??S ACCUSED. AND THOSE THINGS CAN COLLIDE. THOSE IMPORTANT VALUES CAN COLLIDE WITH ONE ANOTHER AND THEN IT BECOMES VERY HARD TO STRIKE A BALANCE.? AS FILMMAKERS MOIRA DEMOS AND LAURA RICCIARDI POINT OUT IN MAKING A MURDERER A FRENZIED MEDIA CAN SPIN THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION OUT OF CONTROL TAINTING A JURY POOL. STRANG IS UNAFRAID TO PLAY DEVIL??S ADVOCATE REFERENCING WHAT IS CERTAIN TO BECOME ONE OF THE BIGGEST CELEBRITY CRIMINAL CASES OF ALL-TIME. ??HOW IS BILL COSBY GOING TO BE PRESUMED INNOCENT MONTHS FROM NOW WHEN HE GOES TO TRIAL IN PENNSYLVANIA?? ASKED STRANG. ??WHAT JUROR WHO??S GOT FUNCTIONING ADULT INTELLIGENCE WILL YOU FIND WHO DOESN??T HAVE SOME OPINION ON WHETHER BILL COSBY IS GUILTY OR INNOCENT BEFORE HE OR SHE HEARS THE FIRST WITNESS TESTIFY? THAT DOESN??T MEAN WE MUTE THE PRESS. BUT IT?ŸDOES?ŸMEAN WE??RE LEFT WITH THE PROBLEM OF HOW DO WE ASSURE THAT BILL COSBY GETS A FAIR TRIAL LIKE ANYONE ELSE IS ENTITLED TO HAVE?? HE HOPES MAKING A MURDERER FANS CHANNEL THEIR FASCINATION AND OUTRAGE OVER THE AVERY CASE INTO ASKING CRUCIAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. ??WHY ARE SO MANY TEENAGERS TREATED AS ADULTS IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM? WHY DO WE IMPOSE SENTENCES OF LIFE WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE?? HE ASKED. ??THAT??S JUST A SLOW DEATH SENTENCE. WHY DO WE DO THAT ESPECIALLY IN A CASE WHERE THERE REALLY ARE SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT GUILT FOR BOTH OF THESE GUYS? ??WHY DO WE HAVE A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN WHICH NORTH OF NINETY PERCENT OF PEOPLE CHARGED WITH A CRIME ANYWHERE IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE NOT ENOUGH MONEY TO HIRE A LAWYER TO DEFEND THEM LET ALONE MOUNT THE REST OF THE DEFENSE?? HE CONTINUED HIS VOICE RISING. ??WHY IS THAT? WHAT ROLE DOES CLASS PLAY IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM BOTH IN THE PROSPECTS OF BEING CHARGED AND IN THE PROSPECTS OF AN OUTCOME? ??ONCE YOU??RE TALKING ABOUT CLASS HOW DO YOU SEPARATE THAT ENTIRELY IN AN AMERICAN SOCIETY FROM RACE OR ETHNICITY OR RECENT ARRIVALS AS AN IMMIGRANT? THAT??S WHAT GETS YOU CLOSELY LINKED TO DISPROPORTIONALLY BEING A MEMBER OF THE SOCIOECONOMIC UNDERCLASS IN THIS COUNTRY? HE SAID. ??THIS LITTLE STORY OUT OF MANITOWOC COUNTY RAISES ALL OF THOSE ISSUES AND MORE. IS IT TOLERABLE IN A SYSTEM THAT VALUES A FAIR TRIAL AND A PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE TO ALLOW PROSECUTORS TO GIVE LURID PRE-TRIAL DETAILED NEWS CONFERENCES THAT ARE SO GRAPHIC AND VIVID THAT HE??S TELLING CHILDREN TO LEAVE THE ROOM AND NOT WATCH THE TELEVISION? THERE ARE ANY NUMBER OF QUESTIONS JOURNALISTS CAN TALK ABOUT AND THAT HONESTLY PEOPLE OUGHT TO BE TALKING ABOUT ACROSS DINNER TABLES.? STRANG SAYS HE WAS ??DISAPPOINTED? BY WISCONSIN GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER??S RECENT DECLARATION THAT HE WOULD NOT GRANT AVERY A PARDON NOR WATCH MAKING A MURDERER. (STRANG REPRESENTED AN UNIDENTIFIED CLIENT WHO WAS ??A POLITICAL ALLY OF GOVERNOR WALKER? IN AN UNRELATED CASE ARGUING AGAINST JOHN DOE STATUTES GRANTING PROSECUTORS EXTRAORDINARY POWERS TO SECRET INVESTIGATIONS IN THE STATE.) ??I HAVE REAL REGRETS THAT THIS GOVERNOR ANNOUNCED?ŸVERY?ŸEARLY IN OR EVEN RIGHT BEFORE HIS FIRST TERM THAT THERE WOULD NOT BE EXECUTIVE CLEMENCY WHILE HE WAS THE GOVERNOR? LAMENTED STRANG. ??HE??S NOT ALONE. AMERICAN GOVERNORS MOSTLY HAVE SHRUNK [AWAY] FROM USING THAT POWER AND AWAY FROM USING THE DIGNITY OF THEIR OFFICE IN THAT WAY TO HELP PEOPLE WHO HAVE REHABILITATED THEMSELVES OR WHO DESERVE AN ACT OF MERCY AS A PART OF JUSTICE.? ??IT??S UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE CLEMENCY FOR TIME IMMEMORIAL IS AN EXECUTIVE PREROGATIVE AND ONLY AN EXECUTIVE PREROGATIVE. COURTS DON??T SIT TO ADMINISTER CLEMENCY. COURTS DON??T SIT TO INTRODUCE A ROLE FOR JUSTICE IN THE YEARS AFTER A CONVICTION??EXECUTIVES DO. AND IT??S UNFORTUNATE TO SEE THEM DODGE THE DIGNITY OF THEIR OFFICE IN THAT RESPECT? HE CONTINUED THEORIZING THAT GUBERNATORIAL AMBITION TO THE WHITE HOUSE IS TO BLAME FOR THE TREND. ??ACTS OF DECENCY ACTS OF MERCY ACTS OF SOVEREIGN GRACE??A GOVERNOR IS THE HIGHEST REPRESENTATIVE INDIVIDUALLY OF STATE GOVERNMENT AND GOVERNMENT WITHOUT GRACE GOVERNMENT WITHOUT MERCY IS A PRETTY HARSH OVERLORD.? STRANG??S LEGACY MIGHT HAVE BEEN MUCH DIFFERENT HAD HE FOLLOWED HIS ORIGINAL CAREER PATH: ??I WANTED TO BE AN EDITORIAL CARTOONIST!? HE REVEALED LAUGHING SOFTLY. ??WHEN I WENT TO LAW SCHOOL I FIGURED I??D NEVER SET FOOT IN A COURTROOM CIVIL OR CRIMINAL.? OR BECOME THIS GENERATION??S ATTICUS FINCH. ,66778.0
1083,10227178.0,2016-01-24T05:15:00+00:00,COULD IRAN BECOME THE NEXT DUBAI AN AVIATION SUPERPOWER?,WELCOME TO TEHRAN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. SOUNDS HIGHLY UNLIKELY RIGHT??Ÿ ON BOTH COUNTS: A WARM GREETING AND A LOGICAL DESTINATION. AFTER ALL THE REPUTATION OF TEHRAN??S OLD INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT WAS FOREVER NAILED IN THE MOVIE ARGO AS A PLACE TO FLEE RATHER THAN ARRIVE REINFORCED BY WHAT HAPPENED LAST WEEKEND WHEN THE SWISS FLIGHT TAKING WASHINGTON POST REPORTER JASON REZAIAN TO FREEDOM SAT ON THE RUNWAY FOR HOURS UNTIL HIS WIFE AND MOTHER WERE ALLOWED TO BOARD. BUT YOU NEVER KNOW. STRANGER THINGS HAVE HAPPENED. FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAD BEEN TOLD JUST TEN YEARS AGO THAT THE WORLD??S BUSIEST AIRPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TRAFFIC WOULD SOON BE ONE SITTING IN AN ARABIAN DESERT YOU WOULD NO DOUBT HAVE THOUGHT IT BONKERS. HOWEVER THE SURPRISING REALITY IS THAT THE WHOLE GEOGRAPHY OF INTERNATIONAL AIR ROUTES IS GOING THROUGH A DISRUPTIVE REVOLUTION??AND THE MIDDLE EAST IS THE PRINCIPAL DISRUPTOR. IRAN WAS LOCKED OUT OF THIS REVOLUTION FOR NEARLY FOUR DECADES BY AN INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS REGIME. AND SO THE QUESTION NOW IS: IS IT TOO LATE FOR THEM TO GET INTO THE GAME IN ANY REALLY EFFECTIVE WAY? CERTAINLY THE PEOPLE RUNNING THE STATE AIRLINE IRAN AIR COULD RUEFULLY BE CONSIDERING A WELCOME BACK NOTE TO THEM FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD WITH THE HEADING ??WHILE YOU WERE AWAY??? RATHER LIKE SOMEONE WHO HAD BEEN ON MARS FOR 35 YEARS WOULD RECEIVE ON RETURNING TO EARTH. TO SEE WHY THIS IS PARTICULARLY POIGNANT FOR THE IRANIANS WE NEED TO SPOOL BACK TO THE 1960S. AIRLINES WERE BEGINNING TO DEPLOY THE FIRST GENERATION OF INTERCONTINENTAL JETS. THIS TRANSFORMED AIR TRAVEL. THE CHANGE IS MOSTLY REMEMBERED FOR THE FACT THAT IT DOUBLED THE SPEED OF COMMERCIAL FLIGHTS FROM THE ERA OF THE PROPELLER??OR TO PUT IT ANOTHER WAY IT HALVED THE TIME IT TOOK TO FLY BETWEEN CONTINENTS. BUT AN EQUALLY LASTING AND PROFOUND CHANGE CAME TO THE PLANNING OF ROUTES. AS JETS DEVELOPED THEY WERE ABLE TO FLY LONGER NONSTOP FLIGHTS BETWEEN MAJOR CITIES. ONE AIRLINE HAD SPOTTED THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS. IT HAD ALWAYS BEEN THE MOST AGGRESSIVE IN BUILDING A GLOBE-ENCIRCLING ROUTE SYSTEM: PAN AMERICAN. THE TYRANNICAL VISIONARY WHO RAN PAN AM JUAN TRIPPE REALIZED THAT WITH U.S. GOVERNMENT SUPPORT (IN A POLICY KNOWN AS ??THE CHOSEN INSTRUMENT?) HE COULD ACT RATHER AS CAPTAIN COOK DID FOR THE BRITISH EMPIRE??BE THE PATHFINDER WHO TOOK AMERICAN INTERESTS AND INFLUENCE INTO EVERY PART OF THE WORLD ENDING FOREVER THE CONCEPT OF REGIONAL REMOTENESS. WHEN BOEING PRODUCED THE FIRST TRULY SUCCESSFUL INTERCONTINENTAL JET THE 707 TRIPPE WAS THE COMPANY??S MOST DEMANDING AND INTERVENTIONIST CUSTOMER. HIS ENGINEERS RODE SHOTGUN ON THE 707??S DESIGNERS PUSHING CONSTANTLY FOR BETTER PERFORMANCE AND FOR TRIPPE??S FIRST TARGET FOR THE JET AGE: NONSTOP FROM NEW YORK TO ROME. TRIPPE SENT PAN AM??S FIRST 707S ON WHAT WERE CALLED PROVING FLIGHTS ACROSS THE WORLD. THE AIRLINE??S MOST EXPERIENCED CAPTAINS ALONG WITH COMPANY EXECUTIVES FLEW INTO DOZENS OF AIRPORTS THAT HAD NEVER SEEN A JET. THEY EXPLAINED TO LOCAL POLITICIANS WHAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO HANDLE FUTURE TRAFFIC??NEW RUNWAYS NAVIGATION AIDS BETTER GATES AND LOUNGES MAINTENANCE BASES??WITH THE IMPLICATION THAT IF THEY COULDN??T DELIVER PAN AM WOULD TAKE ITS BUSINESS ELSEWHERE. ONE PLACE WHERE PAN AM GOT AN ENTHUSIASTIC AUDIENCE WAS TEHRAN. AFTER THE 1953 COUP IN WHICH U.S. AND BRITISH INTELLIGENCE AGENTS ORCHESTRATED THE REMOVAL OF THE DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED PRIME MINISTER MOHAMMAD MOSSADEGH AND REPLACED HIM WITH THEIR STOOGE THE SHAH IRAN WAS VIRTUALLY A CLIENT STATE OF THE U.S. THE SHAH NEEDED LITTLE PERSUASION TO SEE HIMSELF AS A PLAYER IN THE FUTURE OF AVIATION BUYING AMERICAN AIRLINERS WITH THE SAME APPETITE THAT HE HAD FOR AMERICAN MILITARY HARDWARE. MOREOVER TEHRAN HAD ALWAYS BEEN AN OPTIMAL LOCATION ON THE AIR ROUTES LINKING EUROPE THE MIDDLE EAST AND ASIA. ON PAN AM??S ROUTE MAPS FROM THE FIRST POST-WAR EXPANSION OF AIR TRAVEL THE FAVORED CITIES BECAUSE THEY ALIGNED WITH THE MOST EFFICIENT NETWORK WERE LONDON FRANKFURT ROME ISTANBUL TEHRAN DELHI BANGKOK HONG KONG AND TOKYO. AS THE RANGE OF JETS INCREASED NOTABLY WITH THE ARRIVAL OF THE 747 JUMBO PAN AM COULD THIN OUT THESE CLUSTERS TO CREATE A FASTER PATH FOR THEIR PREMIUM INTERCONTINENTAL FLIGHTS. FOR EXAMPLE THEY COULD GO DIRECT FROM EITHER LONDON OR FRANKFURT TO TEHRAN AND FROM TEHRAN DIRECT TO BANGKOK OR HONG KONG. NOTE THE CENTRALITY OF TEHRAN. NOBODY REALIZED IT THEN BUT THE CONVENIENCE OF TEHRAN WAS A HARBINGER: AN AIRPORT COULD BECOME A HUB IN AN INTERNATIONAL NETWORK WITHOUT ITSELF BEING A DESTINATION. ITS GEOGRAPHIC POSITION WAS ITS TRUE VALUE IF IT SAT WHERE MANY INTERNATIONAL FLIGHTS NEEDED A PIT STOP. (THE SAME LOGIC APPLIES TO U.S. DOMESTIC HUBS LIKE ATLANTA BALTIMORE AND CHICAGO.) THE INTERNATIONAL ROUTE NETWORK ESTABLISHED BY PAN AM AND THEN FOLLOWED BY EVERY INTERNATIONAL CARRIER REMAINED UNCHALLENGED FOR DECADES. IT WAS HARD-WIRED INTO THEIR BUSINESS MODELS. IT SUITED THE SETTLED ORDER OF HOW MARKETS WERE CARVED UP BETWEEN THE AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN AIRLINES THAT ENJOYED A POST-WAR ARRANGEMENT THAT WAS A CARTEL OF MONOPOLIES IN ALL BUT NAME. IT TOOK A FEW RENEGADES WITH VISION AND A NEW GENERATION OF JETS ABLE TO FLY LONGER DISTANCES TO UPEND THIS SYSTEM. THE CHALLENGER CAME LITERALLY OUT OF THE DESERT. IN 1985 TIM CLARK BECAME HEAD OF PLANNING FOR A NEW AIRLINE EMIRATES BASED IN DUBAI. CLARK WAS NO LOVER OF COSY CARTELS??HE HAD RUN A SMALL INDEPENDENT BRITISH AIRLINE CALEDONIAN AND SEEN AND FELT HOW THE HIDDEN HAND OF PRICE FIXING AND ROUTE MONOPOLIES WORKED IN EUROPE. CLARK SAW THE SIGNIFICANCE OF DUBAI??S LOCATION HALFWAY BETWEEN EUROPE AND ASIA AND EQUALLY WELL PLACED FOR CONNECTIONS TO AFRICA. HE UNDERSTOOD THAT FOR LONG HAUL ROUTES BETWEEN CONTINENTS THE OLD HUBS LIKE LONDON PARIS AND FRANKFURT WERE A LOGICAL STOP ONLY FOR PASSENGERS BOUND FOR THOSE CITIES. EMIRATES HE DECIDED COULD SHIFT THE IDEAL CENTER POINT FOR INTERCONNECTING FLIGHTS TO A NEW AIRPORT UNCONSTRAINED BY LIMITS IMPOSED BY A SURROUNDING CITY OR THE NIGHT CURFEWS THAT GO WITH OPERATING OUT OF THOSE CITIES??AN AIRPORT THAT COULD HAVE MULTIPLE RUNWAYS AND OPERATE ROUND-THE-CLOCK WITH TERMINALS THAT LOOKED MORE LIKE A FUSION OF SHOPPING MALLS AND RESORT HOTELS. THUS WAS BORN DUBAI INTERNATIONAL. TODAY DUBAI IS THE WORLD??S BUSIEST AIRPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL FLIGHTS. IN 1990 IT HANDLED 4.3 MILLION PASSENGERS IN 2015 IT TOPPED 70 MILLION. A NEW AIRPORT COMPLEX WITH FIVE RUNWAYS AND FOUR TERMINALS DUE TO BE COMPLETED IN 2020 IS DESIGNED TO HANDLE 160 MILLION PASSENGERS ANNUALLY. CLARK (NOW SIR TIM) HAS BUILT THE GROWTH OF EMIRATES ON THE BACK OF TWO AIRPLANES??THE AIRBUS A380 THE WORLD??S LARGEST AND THE LONG RANGE VERSION OF THE SMALLER BOEING 777. EMIRATES HAS BEEN THE WORLD??S SMARTEST EXERCISE IN THE SIZING OF JETS TO SPECIFIC ROUTES USING THE LARGER JET FOR THE MOST DENSELY TRAVELED INTERCITY ROUTES AND THE SMALLER FOR MORE DISPERSED ROUTES. THIS YEAR EMIRATES WILL INTRODUCE THE WORLD??S LONGEST FLIGHT 8600 MILES FROM DUBAI TO PANAMA CITY. (IN THE U.S. EMIRATES NOW FLIES TO NEW YORK LOS ANGELES CHICAGO DALLAS SEATTLE WASHINGTON SAN FRANCISCO BOSTON AND ORLANDO PASSENGERS INVARIABLY RATE THE QUALITY OF SERVICE AT A LEVEL THAT IS SHAMING ?ŸU.S. AIRLINES.) FOR DUBAI ITSELF THE AIRPORT AND ITS AIRLINE HAVE BEEN RAINMAKERS??BRINGING IN NEARLY $27 BILLION A YEAR REPRESENTING 27 PERCENT OF THE GDP. LOOKING AT THIS THE IRANIANS CAN ONLY DREAM ??WHAT IF???Ÿ IF THEY HAD NOT BECOME INTERNATIONAL PARIAHS COULD TEHRAN HAVE BEEN TO AIRLINE ROUTES WHAT DUBAI NOW IS? GEOGRAPHICALLY TEHRAN WAS AS WELL PLACED AS DUBAI??PERHAPS EVEN A TAD BETTER PLACED BEING FURTHER NORTH AND CLOSER TO THE TRADITIONAL FLIGHT CORRIDORS BETWEEN EUROPE AND ASIA. ALSO TEHRAN HAD THE POTENTIAL TO BE A LOT MORE THAN A PIT STOP IN THE DESERT. IT WAS THE GATEWAY TO A COUNTRY WITH SOME OF THE MOST EXQUISITE SITES OF THE ANCIENT WORLD. TODAY THE IRANIANS?? FIRST AND MOST URGENT PRIORITY IS TO REPLACE CLAPPED-OUT AIRPLANES??IT HAS A FLEET OF AIRBUS AND BOEING JETS THAT ARE BETWEEN 20 AND 35 YEARS OLD. ON THE DAY THAT THE SANCTIONS WERE DROPPED IRAN AIR ANNOUNCED THAT IT WOULD ORDER 114 NEW JETS FROM AIRBUS??AND BOEING IS EXPECTING TO GET AN EQUALLY LARGE ORDER. THE AIRLINE SAID IT NEEDS AT LEAST 580 NEW AIRPLANES IN THE NEXT DECADE 300 OF THEM IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. OVERSEAS IRAN AIR HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAP INTO A HUGE MARKET OF EXPATS IN CALIFORNIA CANADA AND EUROPE. THESE DESTINATIONS COULD PRODUCE THE KIND OF DENSITY TO JUSTIFY FOLLOWING THE EMIRATES MODEL AND BUYING A380S THAT CAN CARRY UP TO 600 PASSENGERS WITH JUST A COACH AND BUSINESS CLASS LAYOUT??ALTHOUGH THERE IS A DIASPORA OF FAT CAT IRANIANS WHO WOULD PROBABLY WANT A FIRST CLASS CABIN (IF THEY ARE NOT WARY OF BEING DETAINED ON ARRIVAL AND ASKED TO EXPLAIN THE PROVENANCE OF THEIR WEALTH). IN THE DAYS OF THE SHAH IRAN AIR WAS RUN VERY MUCH LIKE EGYPTAIR MIDDLE EAST AIRLINES JORDANIAN AIRLINES AND GULF AIR EARLIER GENERATIONS OF MIDDLE EASTERN STATE AIRLINES WITH A PREFERENCE FOR AMERICAN JETS (AIRBUS WAS NOT THEN THE EQUAL FORCE THAT IT NOW IS). THEY WERE SEEN (AND OPERATED) AS MUCH AS NATIONAL PRESTIGE PROJECTS AS COMMERCIAL VENTURES. THE SHAH REGARDED THE AIRLINE AS SOMETHING OF A PERSONAL HOBBY. HE ASKED BOEING TO DEVELOP A SMALLER FASTER VERSION OF THE 747 TO FLY LONGER DISTANCES THAN THE STANDARD 747 AND BOEING OBLIGED WITH WHAT WAS CALLED THE BOEING 747SP (SPECIAL PERFORMANCE.) ITS SHORTER FUSELAGE MADE IT LOOK UNNATURALLY PORCINE BUT IT WAS A VERY SPORTY JET AND WAS USED FOR A SHORT TIME BY OTHER AIRLINES LIKE SOUTH AFRICAN AIRWAYS TO FLY NONSTOP ON LONG ROUTES. ONLY 45 WERE BUILT AND IRAN AIR IS THE ONLY AIRLINE STILL OPERATING ONE. IT??S GOING TO BE FASCINATING TO SEE IF IRAN AIR UNDER THE CURRENT REGIME CAN BE RUN NO LONGER AS A VANITY PROJECT BUT AS AN INTERNATIONALLY COMPETITIVE AIRLINE. THE COUNTRY??S VOLATILE MIX OF MULLAHS REVOLUTIONARY GUARD ZEALOTS MILITARY ADVENTURERS NATIVE INDUSTRIALISTS ENTREPRENEURS AND CLOSET REFORMERS HAS NOT PRODUCED THE KIND OF STABLE COMMERCIAL DISCIPLINE THAT IS NORMALLY REQUIRED FOR OPERATING AN AIRLINE TO THE LEVEL OF INNOVATION AND EFFICIENCY EXHIBITED IN DUBAI. IN THIS RESPECT AVIATION COULD BE A NEW THEATER FOR THE CENTURIES-OLD RIVALRY BETWEEN THE ARAB AND PERSIAN CULTURES WITH IRAN PAINFULLY AWARE THAT GIVEN A DIFFERENT HISTORY AND WITH ITS RECORD OF SHREWD INTERNATIONAL TRADING IT MIGHT WELL HAVE BEEN A REAL PLAYER. ,22029.0

GUZM?­N THE WORLD??S MOST WANTED DRUG LORD ESCAPED FROM A MEXICAN FEDERAL PRISON SIX MONTHS AGO SPECIAL FORCES TROOPS ATTACHED TO THE MEXICAN NAVY HAVE PURSUED THE KINGPIN WITH A SCORCHED EARTH POLICY THAT FORCED HIM OUT OF HIS STRONGHOLD IN THE HIGH MOUNTAINS OF HIS NATIVE STATE OF SINALOA. THE HEART OF GUZM?­N??S SINALOA CARTEL THE LARGEST SUPPLIER OF DRUGS TO THE UNITED STATES IS IN THE MOUNTAINS AND FORESTS THAT BLANKET THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST OF MEXICO AN AREA OF THE SIERRA MADRE OCCIDENTAL KNOWN TO DRUG-ENFORCEMENT AS THE GOLDEN TRIANGLE. THE PORTION OF FARMERS WHO CULTIVATE ILLICIT CASH CROPS LIKE MARIJUANA OR OPIUM-POPPY IN THE TRIANGLE??23000 SQUARE MILES SPREAD ACROSS THE STATES OF SINALOA DURANGO AND CHIHUAHUA??CAN EXCEED 80 PERCENT. GUZM?­N??S ESCAPE FROM PRISON ON JULY 11 2015 WAS A MAJOR SOURCE OF EMBARRASSMENT TO THE GOVERNMENT OF MEXICAN PRESIDENT ENRIQUE PENA NIETO. THE DRUG LORD ESCAPED THROUGH A MILE-LONG TUNNEL UNDER HIS CELL IN A MAXIMUM-SECURITY PRISON. WITH A FORTUNE LARGE ENOUGH TO LAND HIM ON THE FORBES LIST OF BILLIONAIRES HE PRESUMABLY COULD HAVE FLED TO ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. BUT FROM THE START THE MANHUNT TO RECAPTURE HIM FOCUSED ON THE PROTECTIVE TERRAIN AND LOYAL CAMPESINOS OF THE GOLDEN TRIANGLE. THE DAILY MAIL REPORTED THAT MARINES TRACKED GUZM?­N TO THE SIERRA MADRE MOUNTAINS AFTER U.S. DRUG AGENTS INTERCEPTED DATA FROM HIS PHONE. THE CHASE FOR GUZM?­N WAS NOT ALWAYS SMOOTH. AS THE DAILY BEAST REPORTED ON OCTOBER 6 THREE NAVAL HELICOPTERS WERE OBSERVED HOVERING LOW IN THE SKY OVER THE MUNICIPALITY OF TAMAZULA IN THE STATE OF DURANGO. MARTA MARBELLA 32 WATCHED THEM FROM HER HOME IN THE TINY MOUNTAIN VILLAGE OF EL VERANO. MARBELLA EXPECTED THE CHOPPERS TO LAND BUT INSTEAD SAID SHE HAD TO RUN FOR COVER AS BULLETS FROM THE HELICOPTERS TORE THROUGH HER MODEST DWELLING. ??I COULD SEE THE HELICOPTER STOP AND SHOOT DIRECTLY AT THE HOUSE? MARBELLA TOLD AFP. ??I WAS SCARED SCREAMED AND CRIED ALTHOUGH I KNEW IT WAS USELESS.? THE MEXICAN NAVY LATER DENIED THAT ITS MARINES FIRED ON A CIVILIAN POPULATION. IN A JOINT STATEMENT MEXICO??S SECURITY FORCES SAID THE OPERATION WAS CONDUCTED WITH THE UTMOST RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. MARBELLA WAS ONE OF AS MANY AS 700 INHABITANTS OF VILLAGES IN THE MOUNTAINS AROUND TAMAZULA WHO FLED THAT PART OF THE SIERRA FOR THE SAFETY OF COSAL?­ A TOWN 80 MILES AWAY IN THE NEIGHBORING STATE OF SINALOA. THREE DAYS LATER ON OCTOBER 9 MEXICAN MARINES SPOTTED THE SINALOA CARTEL CHIEF NEAR COSAL?­. IN THE CONFUSION OF THE FIREFIGHT THAT ENSUED GUZM?­N REPORTEDLY FELL OFF A CLIFF AND BROKE HIS LEG YET SOMEHOW MANAGED TO ESCAPE. THE MARINES PURSUED GUZM?­N FURTHER INTO SINALOA. FOR MONTHS NAVY HELICOPTERS WERE OBSERVED FLYING OVER THE MOUNTAINS NEAR BADIRAGUATO THE MUNICIPALITY WHERE GUZM?­N WAS BORN AND A BASTION OF HIS SINALOA CARTEL. ON NOV. 21 THREE MEN LINKED TO GUZM?­N??S CARTEL WERE KILLED IN BADIRAGUATO. NEWS REPORTS SAID ONLY THAT THE KILLERS WERE PART OF AN ??ARMED COMMANDO.? FOUR MORE OF GUZM?­N??S MEN WERE ASSASSINATED SOON THEREAFTER WHILE RETURNING FROM THE WAKE OF THEIR THREE FALLEN COMRADES. LAST MONTH THE HEAD OF SECURITY FOR AURELIANO GUZM?­N EL CHAPO??S BROTHER WAS AMBUSHED AND ASSASSINATED ALONG WITH SEVEN OF HIS MEN IN THE TINY MOUNTAIN HAMLET OF SAN JOS?? DEL BARRANCO. AGAIN NEWS REPORTS SAID ONLY THAT THE AMBUSH WAS CARRIED OUT BY AN ??ARMED COMMANDO.? AMONG THE SEVEN KILLED WERE MEN FROM LA TUNA THE VILLAGE WHERE EL CHAPO WAS BORN. FOLLOWING THE AMBUSH THE MARINES DEPLOYED TO LA TUNA IN THE EXPECTATION THAT EL CHAPO WOULD ATTEND THE FUNERAL OF HIS FALLEN HENCHMEN. ACCORDING TO LOCAL NEWS REPORTS THE MARINES MADE AN ADDITIONAL INCURSION INTO THE NEARBY VILLAGE OF SURUTATO. R??ODOCE REPORTS THAT THE NAVAL TEAM COMMANDEERED AS THEIR BASE A RANCH IN THE AREA THAT REPORTEDLY BELONGS TO AURELIANO GUZM?­N. SINCE MID-DECEMBER THE MARINES HAVE USED THE BASE TO STAGE INCURSIONS IN THE HEART OF THE SINALOA CARTEL??S EMPIRE. THE INTENSITY OF THE CONFLICT IN THE ERSTWHILE STRONGHOLD OF THE CARTEL PERHAPS EXPLAINS WHY WHEN THE MARINES FINALLY CAUGHT UP TO EL CHAPO YESTERDAY THE CULMINATING FIREFIGHT WAS NOT IN THE HIGH SIERRA OF THE GOLDEN TRIANGLE BUT IN LOS MOCHIS A CITY A HALF-HOUR??S DRIVE FROM THE GULF OF CALIFORNIA ON THE NORTHWESTERN COAST OF MEXICO. THE RECAPTURE OF GUZM?­N WAS A JOINT OPERATION BETWEEN U.S. AND MEXICAN AUTHORITIES. IN A TWEET FROM ITS OFFICIAL ACCOUNT THE US DRUG ENFORCEMENT AGENCY CREDITED ??BILATERAL COOPERATION? FOR THE SUCCESSFUL RECAPTURE OF THE FUGITIVE DRUG-TRAFFICKER. DURING HIS PREVIOUS CAPTURE ON FEBRUARY 22 2014 AGENTS FROM THE DEA AND U.S. MARSHALS SERVICE DONNED THE UNIFORMS AND BALACLAVAS OF MEXICAN MARINES AND MADE THE ARREST THEMSELVES WITH SUPERVISION FROM AN ELITE GROUP OF MEXICAN MARINES. ,8354.0

547,9883831.0,2016-01-13T05:01:00+00:00,THE ROYAL RISE OF THE MIDDLETONS,THIS SUNDAY THE DEVOTED HUDDLE OF ROYAL FANS AT SANDRINGHAM CHURCH WERE GATHERED AS USUAL WAITING TO SEE THE QUEEN ARRIVE FOR CHURCH AS SHE DOES EVERY SUNDAY WHEN SHE IS IN RESIDENCE AT HER NORFOLK ESTATE. THEIR NUMBERS WERE SWELLED BY A FEW PHOTOGRAPHERS WHO HAD BEEN BRIEFED THAT THE QUEEN WOULD BE JOINED BY SEVERAL PROMINENT MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL FAMILY AND THAT THERE WOULD BE A SHORT WREATH-LAYING CEREMONY AFTERWARDS TO MARK THE CENTENARY OF THE ILL-FATED FIRST WORLD WAR GALLIPOLI CAMPAIGN. THEY WERE EXPECTING THE CAMBRIDGES MAYBE A PRINCE ANDREW. JUST ABOUT ENOUGH TO MAKE AN EARLY SUNDAY MORNING START WORTHWHILE. SO IMAGINE THE SURPRISE OF THE ASSEMBLED HACKS WHEN UP THE FROSTY LANEWAY THAT CONNECTS SANDRINGHAM HOUSE TO ST MARY??S CHURCH WHO SHOULD COME STRIDING CONFIDENTLY INTO VIEW BEHIND WILLIAM AND KATE BUT THE ENTIRE MIDDLETON CLAN (THE QUEEN ARRIVED BY CAR)? LOOKING PLEASED AS PUNCH AND SMILING BROADLY FOR THE NOW FRENZIEDLY-SNAPPING CAMERAS CAROLE AND PIPPA LED THE WAY FOLLOWED BY PIPPA??S BROTHER JAMES AND HER FATHER MICHAEL. THE IMMEDIATE CONCLUSION WAS THAT THE MIDDLETONS MUST HAVE BEEN STAYING AT ANMER HALL THE CAMBRIDGE??S SPECTACULAR TEN-BEDROOM COUNTRY HOME WHICH IS FAST BECOMING WILLIAM AND KATE??S FULL TIME BASE WHILE CELEBRATING KATE??S 34TH BIRTHDAY WHICH FELL ON SATURDAY (IT IS A SIGN OF JUST HOW EFFECTIVELY THE CAMBRIDGES HAVE MANAGED TO LOCK DOWN THEIR HOUSEHOLD THAT NOT A ROYAL REPORTER IN THE LAND HAD A CLUE THAT THE MIDDLETONS WERE DUE TO BE SPENDING THE WEEKEND WITH KATE AND WILL). IT WAS PERHAPS SLIGHTLY ODD THAT THEY ALL ARRIVED ON FOOT FROM THE DIRECTION OF SANDRINGHAM HOUSE RATHER THAN IN A CAR FROM ANMER BUT EVEN ODDER WAS THAT AFTER THE CHURCH SERVICE AS THE QUEEN AND PRINCE PHILIP SPENT A FEW MINUTES LAYING WREATHS WITH WILLIAM AND KATE THE REMAINING MIDDLETONS TROTTED OFF BACK IN THE DIRECTION OF SANDRINGHAM WHERE ACCORDING TO SOURCES THEY WERE GUESTS AT A TYPICAL SANDRINGHAM SUNDAY LUNCH. THEY CUT QUITE A SIGHT JAMES BEARDED HANDS IN POCKETS IN A SKINNY PALE BLUE HIPSTER SUIT FROM SAVILE ROW TUCKED OVER CHELSEA BOOTS PIPPA FRESHLY TANNED FROM A RECENT HOLIDAY IN ST BARTS WORE THICK BLACK WOOLLY TIGHTS AND A SHORT DRESS WITH AN EXTRAVAGANT RUSSIAN-STYLE FUR HAT PERCHED ON HER HEAD WHILE KATE??S MUM CAROLE CUT A DASH IN THE KIND OF GLAMOROUS LONG WINTER COAT THAT HER DAUGHTER WEARS SO EFFECTIVELY. IF THERE WAS ANY DOUBT THAT THE MIDDLETONS HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY EMBRACED BY THE QUEEN THIS WAS IT. MAKE NO MISTAKE BEING INVITED TO ATTEND AN INFORMAL SANDRINGHAM CHURCH SERVICE WITH HER MAJESTY IS NO MEAGER ENDORSEMENT. SAYS ONE SOURCE ??GIVEN THE QUEEN??S EMPHASIS ON DUTY AND RELIGION THIS WAS ARGUABLY AN EVEN MORE IMPORTANT MOMENT OF ACCEPTANCE FOR THE MIDDLETON CLAN THAN BEING INVITED TO RIDE IN THE ROYAL CARRIAGE AT ASCOT.? THE QUEEN??S CASUAL INVITATION TO THE MIDDLETONS TO JOIN THE ROYALS FOR LUNCH MAY ALSO HAVE BEEN INTENDED TO MAKE UP FOR THE FACT THAT THEY WERE EXCLUDED FROM CHRISTMAS LUNCH AT SANDRINGHAM ALTHOUGH WILLIAM KATE AND THEIR CHILDREN DID IN FACT HAVE THEIR TURKEY AT THE BIG HOUSE DESPITE EXTENSIVE SPECULATION THAT THEY WERE PLANNING A MORE INFORMAL FAMILY AFFAIR AT THEIR OWN HOME. THE QUEEN IS UNDOUBTEDLY MAKING A CLEAR POINT THAT SHE BELIEVES THE MIDDLETONS WORTHY OF RESPECT AND FULL INCLUSION IN THE ROYAL CIRCLE OF TRUST. THE QUEEN IS SAID TO HAVE INCREASING REGARD FOR CAROLE IN PARTICULAR COMING TO ADMIRE THE WOMAN WHO HAS FOUGHT HER WAY TO THE TOP OF BUSINESS WITH A RESOLUTELY MIDDLE-CLASS ATTITUDE. SHE MAY ONCE HAVE BEEN MOCKED BY HER SON-IN-LAW AND DAUGHTER??S SOCIETY FRIENDS FOR HAVING BEEN A FLIGHT ATTENDANT BUT CAROLE IS NOW HAVING THE LAST LAUGH HAVING SECURED FOR HERSELF AN INVIOLABLE PLACE AT THE HEART OF THE NEW ROYAL ESTABLISHMENT. INTRIGUINGLY PRINCE CHARLES HAS BEEN LESS WELCOMING OF THE MIDDLETONS. ALWAYS ACCUSED OF BEING SOMEWHAT PRONE TO SNOBBISH TENDENCIES HE IS NOT BELIEVED TO HAVE INVITED THE FAMILY TO HIS PRIVATE HOUSE AT HIGHGROVE. IT DOESN??T PARTICULARLY BOTHER KATE OR WILLIAM HOWEVER AND EVEN LESS THE MIDDLETONS THEMSELVES. ??THEY ALWAYS WERE A FAIRLY THICK-SKINNED BUNCH AND THAT TENDENCY HAS ONLY BECOME MORE PRONOUNCED SINCE KATE AND WILLIAM MARRIED? SAYS A FAMILY FRIEND. THE MONARCH ONCE AGAIN IS LEADING BY EXAMPLE. FOR ALTHOUGH THE MIDDLETON CLAN MIGHT DIVIDE OPINION??SOME STILL THINK IT IS INAPPROPRIATE FOR THE FUTURE QUEEN??S MOTHER TO BE RUNNING A WEBSITE SELLING PARTY GEAR AND WRITING ARTICLES FOR MAGAZINES ABOUT HOME ENTERTAINING??THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE STRATEGY OF EMBRACING THE MIDDLETONS HAS MADE KATE??S TRANSITION TO ROYAL LIFE EASIER. INEVITABLY THE MIDDLETONS WILL BE CALLED ON TO PLAY A LARGER AND LARGER ROLE IN PUBLIC LIFE OVER THE NEXT FEW DECADES AND BY INVITING THEM TO ATTEND CHURCH ALONGSIDE HER AND JOIN HER FOR LUNCH AFTERWARDS THE QUEEN IS SHREWDLY?ŸMAKING SURE SHE HAS 100% LOYALTY AS WELL AS LETTING THEM KNOW THEY CAN BE CONFIDENT OF THEIR MEMBERSHIP IN THE CLUB WHATEVER REACTION THEY GET FROM PRINCE CHARLES AND SOME MORE SNIFFY MEMBERS OF THE ESTABLISHMENT. ,87038.0

TONIGHT WE HONOR HOLLYWOOD'S BEST AND WHITEST.\"" THEN AFTER A BEAT: \""SORRY??BRIGHTEST.\"" IT WAS A TONGUE-IN-CHEEK ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF ONE OF THE BIGGEST SCANDALS TO PLAGUE THE OSCARS IN MORE THAN A DECADE: EVERY SINGLE ACTING NOMINEE?ŸWAS WHITE. WORSE IN A YEAR WHEN?ŸSELMA A FILM ABOUT MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. WAS THE BEST REVIEWED FILM OF THE YEAR??BUT SHUT OUT IN EVERY RACE BUT BEST PICTURE. THIS YEAR THE JOKE IS NO LONGER FUNNY.?Ÿ IN A YEAR WHEN DIVERSITY REPRESENTATION OPPORTUNITY AND NORMALIZATION WAS THE DRIVING CONVERSATION OF SHOW BUSINESS??AND RIGHTFULLY SO??WE CAN NOW SAY THAT THIS IS THE WHITEST OSCARS EVER. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A BENCHMARK THIS IS THE WHITEST OSCARS SINCE LAST YEAR. ISN'T THAT DISGUSTING? NOT A SINGLE?ŸACTING NOMINEE?ŸTHIS YEAR IS A PERSON OF COLOR.?Ÿ IDRIS ELBA WAS WIDELY PREDICTED TO BE NOMINATED FOR?ŸBEAST OF NO NATION. HE FAILED TO RECEIVE A NOD. THE ACADEMY FOUND CHRISTIAN BALE'S GLASS EYE IN?ŸTHE BIG SHORT?ŸMORE INTRIGUING INSTEAD. UNLIKE LAST YEAR WHICH WAS INFURIATING IN ITS OWN RIGHT WHEN?ŸSELMA?ŸRECEIVED A BEST PICTURE NOMINATION BUT NOT A BEST DIRECTOR (AVA DUVERNAY) OR BEST ACTOR (DAVID OYELOWO) NOD THERE'S NOT EVEN A \""BLACK\"" FILM OR A FILM THAT CONCERNS PEOPLE OF COLOR IN THE BEST PICTURE RACE.?Ÿ LAST YEAR THE HASHTAG #OSCARSSOWHITE CIRCULATED IN OUTRAGE OVER THE SITUATION. THIS YEAR I'D BE SURPRISED IF WE COULD EVEN MUSTER THE 140-CHARACTER ANGER. MAYBE WE'VE RESIGNED OURSELVES.?Ÿ THE SITUATION IS SO GLARING WE NEED SUNGLASSES. HOLLYWOOD NEEDS SOME SHAMING.?Ÿ WELL ALLOW ME.?Ÿ HERE'S THE SITUATION: YES ALL 20 OSCAR NOMINEES ARE WHITE.?Ÿ IS THAT A SURPRISE? NO.?Ÿ THERE WAS REALLY ONLY ONE PERSON OF COLOR WHO WAS CONSIDERED A LIKELY CONTENDER TO BE NOMINATED??THE AFOREMENTIONED ELBA. HE STARRED IN A MOVIE THAT DEBUTED IN NETFLIX WHICH HAD NEVER LAUNCHED AN AWARDS CAMPAIGN. THE PREVAILING SENTIMENT THOUGH HE WAS DESERVING WAS THAT NETFLIX'S NAIVET?? IN THE WORLD OF AWARDS PUSHES WAS GOING TO HURT HIS CHANCES. THIS ENDED UP BEING CORRECT. DESPITE DESERVING UNEQUIVOCALLY TO BE NOMINATED AND POSSIBLY TO WIN FOR THE KIND OF SOUL-SHAKING TRANSFORMATIVE PERFORMANCE THAT MAKES YOU RECONSIDER YOUR PLACE IN THE WORLD (AND YOU KNOW GIVES MEANING TO THIS RIDICULOUS BUSINESS OF SHOW AND VALIDITY TO THE VAPIDITY OF HOLLYWOOD) ELBA FINDS HIMSELF SHUT OUT. BEASTS OF NO NATION?ŸWAS ABOUT CHILD SOLDIERS FIGHTING IN AFRICA. INSTEAD THE ACADEMY REWARDED WHAT THEY CONSIDER TO BE THE GREATEST HARDSHIP PLAGUING SOCIETY. ACTORS DOING ACCENTS! AND OTHERWISE WHIMSICAL THINGS. OH MY GOD DID YOU EVEN HEAR THE ACCENT CHRISTIAN BALE HAD IN?ŸTHE BIG SHORT? IT WAS WELL IT WASN'T CLEAR WHAT IT WAS. BUT IT WAS NOT HIS NORMAL SPEAKING VOICE!

AT THE VERY LEAST GIVE IT TO SYLVESTER STALLONE WHO GIVES A SEMBLANCE OF A PERFORMANCE.?Ÿ LAST YEAR WE ALL TOOK ON A CAUSE.?Ÿ A BODY THAT WAS 94 PERCENT WHITE 76 PERCENT MALE AND AN AVERAGE OF 63-YEARS-OLD FAILED TO NOMINATE A SINGLE PERSON OF COLOR FOR THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS AND IMPORTANT AWARDS IN ENTERTAINMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ALMOST TWO DECADES. THIS YEAR THEY DIDN'T NOMINATE A SINGLE PERSON OF COLOR FOR...THE FIRST TIME SINCE LAST YEAR. WORSE THERE WAS A SENSE OF DREAD AMONG THOSE IN THE INDUSTRY LEADING UP THIS MORNING'S NOMINATIONS IN ANTICIPATION OF THE WHITEST OSCARS EVER (SINCE LAST YEAR). \""CRAP\"" THEY WHISPERED. \""THOSE BLOGGERS ARE ABOUT TO LAY INTO US.\"" YES. YES THEY ARE. BECAUSE THEY CAN'T BE BOTHERED TO LAY INTO THEMSELVES. THEY FAILED TO NOMINATE ELBA. THEY FAILED TO NOMINATE?ŸSTRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON?ŸFOR BEST PICTURE THE FILM ABOUT THE RAP GROUP NWA THAT WAS WIDELY CONSIDERED (BY REVIEWERS AND MOVIEGOERS ALIKE) ONE OF THE BEST MADE FILMS OF THE YEAR. IT DID WELL AT PRECURSOR CEREMONIES THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO PREDICT SUCH THINGS LIKE THE PGA AWARDS AND THE SAG AWARDS. BUT NOT THE WHITE-WASHED OSCARS! NO THE OSCARS DIDN'T IT GIVE THE PREDICTED BEST PICTURE NOD IT DESERVED. STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON?ŸHAS AN 88 PERCENT RATING ON ROTTEN TOMATOES. THAT'S NOT AS HIGH AS?ŸSELMA WHICH HAD A 99 SCORE LAST YEAR WHEN IT BECAME THE BEACON OF SNUBBED DIVERSITY. BUT IT WAS THE FILM THAT WAS RULED \""THE CONTENDER\"" FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR THIS YEAR.?Ÿ BECAUSE APPARENTLY THEY ONLY GET ONE. STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON?ŸWAS BETTER REVIEWED THAN?ŸTHE REVENANT THE MOST NOMINATED FILM THIS YEAR. (ITS ROTTEN TOMATOES SCORE WAS AN 81 CAPPED OFF BY A MID-SCREENING SNOOZE BY YOURS TRULY. THIS MOVIE WAS RIDICULOUSLY LONG!) BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY I GUESS IT WAS CONSIDERED THE \""ONE\"" FILM. THE ONE FILM ANYONE WHO CARES ABOUT DIVERSITY GETS. IT'S BEEN A YEAR IN CINEMA WHERE?ŸTANGERINE?Ÿ(ROTTEN TOMATOES SCORE: 96) CHANGED THE CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT FILMMAKING IS AND HUMANIZED ONE OF THE MOST TOPICAL ISSUES OF OUR TIME. BUT WHY NOMINATE THAT WHEN THERE'S A SPIELBERG FILM ABOUT A WAR TO SLEEPILY CHECK OFF ON YOUR BALLOT? IT'S BEEN A YEAR WHEN A BLACK FILMMAKER AND A BLACK ACTOR REVITALIZED ONE OF CINEMA'S MOST HALLOWED FRANCHISES WITH?ŸCREED?Ÿ(ROTTEN TOMATOES SCORE 93) AND SCREENED TO STANDING OVATIONS FOR AUDIENCES AND REVIEWERS ALIKE. THAT'S NICE! LET'S GIVE THE ONE WHITE GUY INVOLVED AN OSCAR NOD. (RYAN COOLGER AND MICHAEL B. JORDAN ARE OSCAR NOMINEES IN MY HEART.) IT'S BEEN A YEAR WHEN SAMUEL L. JACKSON WHO WAS ONLY IN THE PAST WEEK PASSED AS THE HIGHEST GROSSING ACTOR OF ALL TIME GAVE THE PERFORMANCE OF HIS CAREER IN?ŸTHE HATEFUL EIGHT BUT FAILED TO PASS THE TEST FOR ACTOR WHO GETS CAMPAIGNED FOR A TARANTINO FILM. (THAT TEST IS \""ARE YOU WHITE?\"" JENNIFER JASON LEIGH PASSED WITH FLYING COLORS.)?Ÿ IT'S BEEN A YEAR WHEN BRYAN CRANSTON AND WILL SMITH BOTH DID SILLY ACCENTS IN BEST PICTURE CONTENDERS BUT ONLY OF THEM HAD A SERIOUS PUSH FOR AN OSCAR NOMINATION BECAUSE HE WAS IN A MOVIE ABOUT IMPORTANT THINGS LIKE WHITE MOVIE WRITERS WHO HAVE BEEN MISTREATED AND NOT IMPORTANT THINGS LIKE AFRICAN DOCTORS ATTEMPTING TO CHANGE THE WORLD'S MINDS ABOUT THE VALUE OF AN ENTERTAINMENT INSTITUTION THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE KILLING PEOPLE. HA! NO NOT THE OSCARS. THE NFL. BUT GOOD GUESS! THIS IS TO SAY THAT THERE WAS ARGUABLY A PLETHORA OF MOVIES THAT WERE MADE BY AND FEATURED PEOPLE OF COLOR AND THEIR STORIES THIS YEAR. BUT THEY WERE NOT FOR WHATEVER REASON DEEMED \""CAMPAIGNABLE.\"" OR OSCAR WORTHY. AND IF THEY WERE IT WAS ONLY IN THE SERVICE ON ENSURING THAT THERE WASN'T ANOTHER WHITE-WASHED NOMINATION LIST THAT COULD BE PICKED APART BY OUTRAGED INTERNET WRITERS LIKE ME.?Ÿ IT'S INFURIATING THAT FOR THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW THE ORGANIZATION WITH THE POWER TO CHALLENGE SOCIETY TO BE A CATALYST FOR AT BEST FORWARD THINKING OR AT THE VERY LEAST WISKING US OFF TO A DIFFERENT WORLD ONE THAT MAKES US CONTEMPLATE OUR OWN DOESN'T DEEM A STORY INVOLVING A PERSON OF COLOR WORTHY. ESPECIALLY WHEN FILMS THAT DID ALL THOSE THINGS AND NONCHALANTLY FEATURED PEOPLE OF COLOR?ŸWERE?ŸWORTHY. WHY DOES?ŸTHE REVENANT OR?ŸTRUMBO OR?ŸBRIDGE OF SPIES OR?ŸMAD MAX: FURY ROAD?ŸFEATURE INTO AN AWARDS CONVERSATION WHEN?ŸBEASTS OF NATION?ŸSTRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON?ŸTANGERINE OR WILL SMITH DOESN'T? LOOK AT THE FACES OF THE PEOPLE ON SCREEN AND THEN AT THE PEOPLE VOTING FOR THEM. IT'S SIMPLE. LAST YEAR'S?ŸSELMA'S SNUB WAS PROBABLY MORE EGREGIOUS THAN THE LACK OF NOMINATIONS FOR ANY OF THOSE FILMS THOUGH I'LL ARGUE THAT THE FACT THAT NONE OF THOSE FILMS WERE CAMPAIGNED AS HARD AS THEIR \""WHITE\"" COUNTERPARTS TO BE INSTITUTIONALIZED RACISM IN ITS OWN SORT.?Ÿ BUT THE FACT THAT THOSE SNUBS LAST YEAR KINDLED SUCH CULTURAL FIRE ABOUT THE LACK OF DIVERSITY IN THE ACADEMY AND THE TANGIBLE REPERCUSSIONS FOR OMITTING RECOGNITION FOR STORIES ABOUT PEOPLE OF COLOR AND THEN THIS YEAR WE REPEATED THE MISTAKE IS INEXCUSABLE.?Ÿ BUT IT'S NOT THE ONLY THING WE NEED TO WORK ON. NOT ONE OF THE BEST PICTURE NOMINEES WAS MADE BY A WOMAN. FEMALE FILMMAKERS IN THE MIDST OF A CONVERSATION ABOUT EQUAL PAY EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AND EQUAL RECOGNITION WERE SNUBBED ENTIRELY. MAYBE THERE WASN'T AN OSCAR WORTHY FILM BY A FEMALE FILMMAKER. BUT MAYBE THERE ALSO WASN'T AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE ONE. FOLLOWING A TREND THAT BEGAN LAST YEAR THE BEST ACTRESS AND BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS RACES FEATURED PERFORMANCES THAT WERE IN FILMS THAT WEREN'T DEEMED GOOD ENOUGH FOR BEST PICTURE. ONLY SAOIRSE RONAN FOR?ŸBROOKLYN BRIE LARSON FOR?ŸROOM AND RACHEL MCADAMS FOR?ŸSPOTLIGHT?ŸCAN SAY THAT THEY ARE ACTING NOMINEES FOR FILMS THAT ARE ALSO AMONG THE \""BEST\"" OF THE YEAR. TWICE AS MANY MALE NOMINEES (AND EVERY DIRECTING NOMINEE) CAN.?Ÿ THE MESSAGE HERE: DON'T INVEST IN MOVIES THAT HAVE WOMEN IN POWER ROLES OR THAT TELL THEIR STORIES.?Ÿ THE ACADEMY OF MOTION PICTURE ARTS AND SCIENCE THE BODY THAT VOTES FOR THE OSCARS EACH YEAR IS HEADED BY PRESIDENT CHERYL BOONE ISAACS. ISAACS IS A BLACK WOMAN. SHE IS A BLACK WOMAN FRONTING A HISTORICALLY RACIST AND SEXIST ORGANIZATION. OF COURSE ISSACS'S INVOLVEMENT WITH THE AWARDS SHOULDN'T SERVE AS A MANDATE OR EVEN PROVIDE AN EXPECTATION THAT THE BODY SHE GOVERNS REWARD DIVERSE TALENT. NO. THAT SHOULD BE ON US. WE SHOULD BE THE ONES NOT TOLERATING THIS.?Ÿ THAT SHAMES THE OLD WHITE MALE ORGANIZATION THAT HAS THE POWER TO MINT THE KIND OF CULTURAL TOUCHSTONES THAT CAN CHANGE SOCIETY OUR THINKING AND AT LEAST MAKE US THINK. WE SHOULD BE THE ONES WHO ROLL OUR EYES AT CONVERSATIONS ABOUT PROGRESS AND CHANGE WHEN ONE EMMY AWARDS HAPPENS TO REWARD PEOPLE OF COLOR??WE DID IT! EVERYONE GIVE YOURSELVES PATS ON THE BACK!??BUT THE ACADEMY AWARDS CONTINUES TO LIMIT THE CONVERSATIONS TO STORIES ABOUT THE WHITE MALE EXPERIENCE. THAT CONFUSES THE EXISTENCE OF THE SINGULAR SHONDA RHIMES FOR ACTUAL CHANGE. MAYBE NO FILM THIS YEAR STARRING OR MADE BY PEOPLE OF COLOR OR BY A WOMAN DESERVED SERIOUS OSCAR CONSIDERATION. MAYBE THIS IS TRULY THE BEST SLATE OF NOMINEES. BUT THAT'S AN ISSUE IN AND OF ITSELF. THE STORIES THAT ARE BEING TOLD AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING ALLOWED TO TELL THEM IS TOO LIMITED IF THAT'S THE CASE.?Ÿ THIS NOT EVEN STARTING THE CONVERSATION ABOUT?ŸCAROL A FILM THAT RECEIVED ORGASMIC REVIEWS BY CRITICS SCORED TWO ACTING NOMINATIONS AND WAS OTHERWISE IGNORED AND ROBBED FOR A BEST PICTURE NOMINATION.?Ÿ SHOULD WE BE SURPRISED THAT THE AWARDS GROUP THAT GAVE?ŸCRASH?ŸBEST PICTURE INSTEAD OF?ŸBROKEBACK MOUNTAIN?ŸAND ONLY REWARDS FILMS ABOUT THE QUEER EXPERIENCE WHEN IT'S A STRAIGHT ACTOR \""BRAVELY\"" AND \""DARINGLY\"" PLAYING GAY (HI EDDIE REDMAYNE CATE BLANCHETT AND ROONEY MARA)? \""PROBABLY NOT\"" IS THE RIGHT ANSWER.

KENDALL BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT WAS QUITE UNUSUAL.? AS EARLY AS MAY 2015 KENDALL HAD BEEN MADE AWARE THAT AT LEAST ONE EMAIL IN CLINTON??S ARCHIVES INCLUDED CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. BUT THAT DIDN??T BECOME PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE FOR SOME TIME AND WHEN THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN BECAME AWARE OF IT IS UNCLEAR. AS LATE AS JULY 1 CLINTON CAMPAIGN SPOKESWOMAN KAREN FINNEY WAS PUSHING BACK AGAINST THE NOTION TELLING MSNBC THAT ??THE ASSUMPTION THAT THERE WAS CLASSIFIED INFORMATION BEING COMMUNICATED ON THIS BLACKBERRY I THINK HAS BEEN SHOWN IN THESE EMAILS TO JUST BE SIMPLY UNTRUE.? KENDALL AND A STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON DID NOT RESPOND TO REQUESTS FOR COMMENT. BRIAN FALLON A CLINTON CAMPAIGN SPOKESMAN NOTED THAT KENDALL HAD AN OBLIGATION TO RETAIN THE FORMER SECRETARY??S EMAILS IN ORDER TO RESPOND TO VARIOUS GOVERNMENT INQUIRIES. ??DAVID KENDALL WAS ADHERING TO A PRESERVATION REQUEST FROM THE FBI STATE DEPARTMENT INSPECTOR GENERAL AND THE HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON BENGHAZI? FALLON TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. THE ARRANGEMENT WITH KENDALL HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY REPORTED. BUT THE DOCUMENTS REVEAL NEW DETAILS ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING INSIDE THE STATE DEPARTMENT AS OFFICIALS MOVED AHEAD WITH THE UNORTHODOX SETUP. AT ONE POINT A STATE DEPARTMENT LAWYER QUESTIONED WHETHER KENDALL OR ONE OF HIS ASSOCIATES KATHERINE TURNER WAS QUALIFIED TO RECEIVE AND MAINTAIN CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. ??DO ANY OF THE LAWYERS HAVE TS [TOP SECRET] CLEARANCES? SARAH PROSSER A LEGAL ADVISER AT STATE ASKED COLLEAGUES IN AN EMAIL IN AUGUST 2015 AFTER MORE CLASSIFIED MATERIAL HAD BEEN FOUND IN CLINTON??S EMAILS. IT??S NOT CLEAR FROM THE EMAILS PORTIONS OF WHICH ARE HEAVILY REDACTED WHAT THE ANSWER WAS BUT KENDALL LATER SAID HE AND TURNER DID HAVE A TOP SECRET-LEVEL CLEARANCE GIVEN TO HIM PREVIOUSLY BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT AS PART OF HIS WORK REPRESENTING CLINTON BEFORE THE BENGHAZI COMMITTEE. THERE??S NO INDICATION OF WHAT LEGAL REVIEW STATE UNDERTOOK TO VERIFY THAT OR DETERMINE WHETHER THE ARRANGEMENT WAS ACCEPTABLE. TOP SECRET CLEARANCES DON??T NECESSARILY ENTITLE SOMEONE TO ALL CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. SEN. CHUCK GRASSLEY (R-IA) LATER QUESTIONED WHETHER THERE MAY HAVE BEEN INFORMATION IN THE EMAILS FOR WHICH KENDALL AND TURNER DIDN??T HAVE THE APPROPRIATE CLEARANCES INCLUDING SO-CALLED COMPARTMENTED INFORMATION THAT IS DERIVED FROM SOME OF THE MOST HIGHLY CLASSIFIED INTELLIGENCE-COLLECTING SYSTEMS IN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. THE INTERNAL STATE DEPARTMENT CORRESPONDENCE ALSO SHOWS THAT SECURITY OFFICIALS INTENDED TO INSTALL A SAFE AND RECORDS-KEEPING SYSTEM THAT WAS SUITABLE ONLY UP TO THE SECRET LEVEL A LOWER DESIGNATION THAN TOP SECRET. KENDALL HAS LONG ARGUED PARTICULARLY IN CORRESPONDENCE WITH LAWMAKERS THAT THE EMAILS IN HIS POSSESSION WERE NOT ORIGINALLY CLASSIFIED AND WERE ONLY DEEMED SO AFTER THEY WERE REVIEWED BY GOVERNMENT AUDITORS. ONE INTERNAL EMAIL SHOWS THAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT SHARED THAT ASSESSMENT. ??IN THE FIRST TRANCHE OF EMAILS THERE WAS ONE THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY CLASSIFIED? AN EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT AT STATE TOLD GREGORY STARR THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR DIPLOMATIC SECURITY IN AN EMAIL RECOUNTING THE EXCHANGES BETWEEN KENNEDY AND KENDALL. STARR WAS ASKED TO APPOINT SOMEONE FROM STATE??S DIPLOMATIC SECURITY BUREAU TO GO TO KENDALL??S LAW FIRM WILLIAMS & CONNOLLY ??TO DO A THOROUGH SECURITY REVIEW TO INCLUDE PHYSICAL SECURITY OF AREA/SAFE IN WHICH DOCUMENT/ELECTRONIC VERSIONS ARE BEING KEPT WHO HAS ACCESS TO THE AREA/SAFE DO THOSE INDIVIDUALS HAVE APPROPRIATE CLEARANCES??? IT??S NOT CLEAR FROM THE DOCUMENTS WHAT REVIEWS TOOK PLACE. THE QUESTION OF WHETHER KENDALL SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO KEEP CLASSIFIED EMAIL RECEIVED NEW SCRUTINY IN JULY 2015 AFTER INVESTIGATORS FOUND ADDITIONAL CLINTON EMAILS THAT THEY THOUGHT CONTAINED CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. AT THE TIME GRASSLEY SAID THAT AT LEAST TWO EMAILS CONTAINED ??TOP SECRET SENSITIVE COMPARTMENTED INFORMATION.? INVESTIGATORS FOUND THAT CLINTON??S EMAILS CONTAINED INFORMATION FROM AT LEAST FIVE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES. KENDALL GAVE THE THUMB DRIVE TO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ON AUG. 6 AND GAVE COPIES TO THE FBI. THE INTERNAL STATE DEPARTMENT EMAILS SHOW EMPLOYEES REACTING TO NEWS THAT THE FBI HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF THE THUMB DRIVE AS WELL AS A SERVER IN HER HOME IN CHAPPAQUA NEW YORK AND THAT SOME OF THE EMAILS WERE SAID TO CONTAIN CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. ON AUG. 11 A STATE PRESS OFFICER SENT AROUND CLIPS OF NEWS ARTICLES NOTING THAT ??THIS IS BREAKING WIDELY? AND PROVIDING A BRIEF SUMMARY. THE NEARLY 20 RECIPIENTS INCLUDED PRESS STAFF A SENIOR ATTORNEY AND KENNEDY. PROSSER THE STATE DEPARTMENT ATTORNEY WHO??D ASKED WHETHER KENDALL AND TURNER HAD PROPER SECURITY CLEARANCES FORWARDED THE EMAIL TO OTHER ATTORNEYS AND DEPARTMENT SECURITY PERSONNEL INCLUDING SOME OF THOSE SHE??D BEEN CORRESPONDING WITH ABOUT THE CLEARANCE QUESTION. WHILE STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS INITIALLY MAY HAVE FELT THAT NON-GOVERNMENT LAWYERS WERE QUALIFIED TO MAINTAIN CLASSIFIED EMAILS AT THEIR OFFICE THEY CHANGED THEIR TUNE AS INVESTIGATORS BEGAN TO DISCOVER MORE TOP SECRET INFORMATION AMONG CLINTON??S COMMUNICATIONS. IN LATE JULY AS THE FBI WAS PREPARING TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THE THUMB DRIVE KENNEDY WROTE TO LAWYERS FOR THREE OF CLINTON??S TOP AIDES??SULLIVAN PHILIPPE REINES AND HUMA ABEDIN??ASKING THEM TO TURN OVER ??ALL COPIES OF POTENTIAL FEDERAL RECORDS? IN THEIR CLIENTS?? POSSESSION. KENNEDY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE AIDES (LIKE KENDALL) MIGHT NEED ACCESS TO THE RECORDS IN ORDER TO RESPOND TO CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRIES AND OTHER INVESTIGATIONS. THE STATE DEPARTMENT WAS MORE THAN HAPPY TO GIVE THEM ACCESS KENNEDY SAID. THEY JUST HAD TO SHOW UP AT DEPARTMENT HEADQUARTERS DURING NORMAL BUSINESS HOURS AND READ THEM THERE. ,338051.0

738,10010702.0,2016-01-17T05:01:00+00:00,HOLLYWOOD GOES FULL-ON DEVIL WORSHIP,IF YOU CAN IMAGINE SATAN ROAMING AROUND THE STREETS OF LOS ANGELES LIKE HE??S JUSTIN BIEBER CIRCA 2013??DRIVING A FAST CAR CATCHING THE INTERESTED STARES FROM BOTH GIRLS AND BOYS AT THE BARS AND GETTING INTO TROUBLE WITH THE LAW THE LADIES AND THE LORD ALL AT THE SAME TIME??YOU??LL HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA OF HOW FOX??S NEW TV SHOW LUCIFER BEGINS. THAT??S RIGHT AMERICA??FOX IS BRINGING A SHOW ABOUT SATAN TO PRIMETIME. NOBODY??S SHOCKED REALLY. THIS IS A NETWORK OWNED BY A COMPANY THAT FOR YEARS HAS ENABLED THE PUBLIC WITH NIGHTLY DOSES OF BILL O??REILLY. MOREOVER SOME AMERICANS??LIKELY BILL O??REILLY FANS??HAVE LONG DECRIED FOX AS ONE OF THE DEVIL??S NETWORKS SUGGESTING THAT SHOWS LIKE FAMILY GUY AND/OR GLEE TO BE THE FECES OF SATAN. OF COURSE IT??S OBVIOUS WHY FOX IS TAKING A CHANCE ON LUCIFER. LIKE THE NETWORK??S SEMI-HIT SHOW GOTHAM THE LEAD CHARACTER IS DERIVED FROM A DC COMICS SERIES A TREND THAT A LOT OF NETWORKS??FROM NETFLIX TO THE CW??ARE FOLLOWING BANKING HUGE BUDGETS ON SHOWS ADAPTED FROM COMIC BOOK CHARACTERS. IN LUCIFER THE DEVIL INCARNATE IS LOOSELY BASED ON ??LUCIFER MORNINGSTAR???A CHARACTER THAT DEBUTED IN DC COMICS?? THE SANDMAN IN 1989 AND LATER HEADLINED ITS OWN EPONYMOUSLY-TITLED SERIES. IN FOX??S VERSION OF LUCIFER AN HOURLONG DRAMEDY THAT STARS WHALES NATIVE TOM ELLIS AS THE CHARMING PRINCE OF (SEMI) DARKNESS SATAN IS A BORED UNINSPIRED AND LIKABLE SUPERNATURAL HUMAN WHO WITHOUT GIVING NOTICE DECIDES TO TAKE A LEAVE OF ABSENCE FROM HELL AND SEARCH FOR A LITTLE EXCITEMENT IN LA. WITHIN THE FIRST FEW MINUTES OF THE FOX-PLANNED 13-EPISODE ARC WE LEARN THAT LUCIFER IS NOT ONLY A SMOOTH-TALKING WELL-DRESSED SMARTASS WITH A PENCHANT FOR CRACKING PUNCH LINES AND QUIPPING SMARTLY WORDED COMEBACKS HE??S ALSO A SELF-IDENTIFYING VICTIM??SOMEBODY WHO THINKS HE??S BEEN ABUSED BY GOD SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME. THIS FACT IS DELIVERED WHEN LUCIFER GETS A SURPRISE VISIT FROM AMENADIEL ANOTHER ANGELIC CREATURE WHO HAS JUST FLOWN IN FROM HEAVEN WITH A MESSAGE FOR LUCIFER FROM GOD??GO BACK TO HELL IMMEDIATELY! SIDE NOTE: THE ROLE OF AMENADIEL IS PLAYED BY D. B. WOODSIDE WHOM YOU MIGHT REMEMBER PLAYED ??WAYNE PALMER? ONE OF THE FORMER PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES FROM 24. AND GUESS WHAT? IN LUCIFER WOODSIDE LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE 24??S FORMER POTUS EXCEPT HE??S DONNING ENORMOUS ANGEL WINGS. SADLY THOUGH HE WAS IMPRESSIVE PLAYING A PRESIDENT HERE AS AN ANGEL WITH HUGE WINGS WOODSIDE COMES OFF AS UNCOMFORTABLE AT BEST. HOWEVER DURING THEIR CONVERSATION LUCIFER REFERS TO HIMSELF AS A ??MERE PAWN? ONE WHO IS ONLY FILLING THE ROLE OF AN ??INHERENTLY EVIL? ANTAGONIST IN A PLAY WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY ??DEAR OLE DAD? WHICH IS HOW LUCIFER REFERS TO GOD. THROUGH A SERIES OF EVENTS LUCIFER EVENTUALLY REALIZES THAT NABBING CRIMINALS BRINGS HIM A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SOLACE EVEN JOY??AND TO THAT END HE STARTS HELPING THE LAPD CATCH BAD GUYS. THAT AT LEAST ACCORDING TO THE FIRST EPISODE WILL BECOME AN ONGOING WEEKLY GIG FOR OUR VILLAIN (OR IS IT HERO?)??IT??S HARD TO KNOW REALLY. HONESTLY THERE??S A LOT TO LIKE ABOUT LUCIFER??IT??S SHARPLY WRITTEN AND EXCEPT FOR WOODSIDE??S ANGEL IS WELL CASTED. AND ELLIS??S DELIVERY AS SATAN IS QUITE GOOD IN FACT MAYBE TOO GOOD. IN EPISODE 1 LUCIFER IS WAY TOO MUCH OF A GOOD GUY AT TIMES??HE CRIES HE SECOND GUESSES HECK HE EVEN FEELS MERCY. A LIKABLE SATAN ISN??T A BAD IDEA. IN FACT MOST PEOPLE??EVEN THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN SATAN??WOULD BE OKAY WITH SATAN BEING A LIKABLE VILLAIN. BUT THAT UNCERTAINTY??WHETHER HELL??S ONETIME OVERSEER IS GOOD BAD OR CUTE AND LOVABLE??MIGHT ULTIMATELY BECOME THE SHOW??S FALL FROM GRACE. AS ONE MIGHT EXPECT LUCIFER??S ??GOOD GUY? STORYLINE HAS SPARKED A GOOD BIT OF BACKLASH FROM SEVERAL LARGE CHRISTIAN GROUPS INCLUDING THE AMERICAN FAMILY ASSOCIATION (AFA) AND ONE MILLION MOMS. NOT ONLY HAVE BOTH ORGANIZATIONS INITIATED ONLINE CAMPAIGNS AGAINST LUCIFER ASKING FOX TO REMOVE IT FROM ITS SCHEDULE THEY??VE ALSO ACTIVELY CAMPAIGNED AGAINST THE SHOW ON SOCIAL MEDIA. THAT SAID FOX LIKELY ISN??T LISTENING TO THE FAITH-BASED NOISE SINCE MARKETING THIS SHOW TO CHRISTIANS WOULD BE RATHER FRUITLESS. HOWEVER ODDLY ENOUGH FOX MIGHT END UP NEEDING TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE COMPLAINTS OF THOSE CHRISTIAN MOMS. BECAUSE THEY??RE HONESTLY NOT WRONG ABOUT LUCIFER. IN FACT THE REASONS WHY THOSE ONE MILLION MOMS (OR JUST 80000 MOMS AS IS THE CASE ON FACEBOOK) ARE CURRENTLY DECRYING THE SHOW MIGHT BECOME THE SAME REASONS THE NETWORK??S TARGET DEMOGRAPHIC LOSES INTEREST??BECAUSE LUCIFER IS TOO PRETTY TOO HUMAN TOO CONSCIENTIOUS TOO MUCH LIKE ROBIN HOOD. AND WHILE WALKING THAT GOOD/BAD LINE WORKS FOR A VARIETY OF OTHER CHARACTERS I??M JUST NOT SURE THAT A SINCERELY GOOD SATAN IS A SELLABLE CONCEPT FOR THE LONG HAUL. IN FACT EVEN BEFORE ITS DEBUT THE SHOW??S FACEBOOK PAGE HAS GARNERED SEVERAL COMMENTS FROM CONCERNED POTENTIAL VIEWERS ABOUT LUCIFER??S GOOD-GUY PERSONA. ONE OF THE SHOW??S FANS PUT IT LIKE THIS: ??I AM DEFINITELY TUNING IN FOR THE START OF THE SEASON BUT IF THE SHOW IS GOING TO MAKE LUCIFER A NAUGHTY GOOD BOY INSTEAD OF A CHARMING EVIL I AM NOT INTERESTED.? IRONICALLY LUCIFER MIGHT END UP BEING ??TOO GOOD? FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO INTEREST IN WATCHING AND ??NOT BAD ENOUGH? FOR THOSE WHO DO. ,39479.0

THE SHOW THAT PREDICTED OREGON??S BUNDY MILITIA,TO EXECUTIVE PRODUCER PAUL GIAMATTI OUTSIDERS IS A ??BIKER MOVIE CROSSED WITH THE DEER HUNTER.? TO CREATOR PETER MATTEI IT??S MORE LIKE ??SHAKESPEARE CROSSED WITH WINTER??S BONE.? BUT TO MANY VIEWERS IT WILL LOOK A LOT LIKE THE SHOWDOWN BETWEEN AMMON BUNDY??S OREGON MILITIA AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ONLY WITH MORE DRUM CIRCLES. IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE DAILY BEAST MATTEI MAKES CLEAR THAT ANY PARALLELS BETWEEN HIS NEW CABLE DRAMA AND THE REAL-LIFE SITUATION IN EASTERN OREGON ARE PURELY COINCIDENTAL. HE SAYS HE DOESN??T ??KNOW SHIT? ABOUT THE DETAILS OF THE STAND-OFF WHICH CONCERNS A COUPLE OF RANCHERS WHO WERE CONVICTED OF SETTING FIRE TO FEDERAL LAND. BUT IF THERE IS A CONNECTION IT IS REFLECTED IN THE ??ANGER? HE SEES FROM A WIDE SWATH OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. ??YOU JUST HAVE TO WATCH A REPUBLICAN DEBATE TO SEE THAT PEOPLE ARE VERY ANGRY? MATTEI SAYS. ??RIGHT NOW A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY ARE ANGRY AND THEY FEEL THAT THEIR FREEDOMS ARE BEING IMPINGED ON. SOME PEOPLE THINK IT??S BY THE GOVERNMENT OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT THINK IT??S BY CORPORATIONS OR BY TECHNOLOGY.? OUTSIDERS WHICH PREMIERES NEXT TUESDAY JANUARY 26 ON WGN IS SET IN KENTUCKY COAL COUNTRY. AS THE SHOW OPENS A COAL COMPANY HAS ENLISTED THE LOCAL SHERIFF??S DEPARTMENT TO EVICT THE FARRELL FAMILY WHICH HAS LIVED ISOLATED FROM SOCIETY ON THE COAL-RICH MOUNTAINTOP FOR MORE THAN 200 YEARS. IN THE VIEW OF ONE EXECUTIVE IT??S TIME FOR THE ??RETARDED HILLBILLY ANIMALS? TO RELOCATE. THE FARRELLS HAVE THEIR OWN CUSTOMS RITUALS AND HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE DEVELOPED OVER CENTURIES AND DON??T BELIEVE IN THINGS LIKE MONEY OR FROM THE LOOKS OF THEM HAIRCUTS. THEY COUNT THE YEARS IN ??WINTERS? AND DON??T LOOK KINDLY ON THOSE WHO STRAY FROM THE FLOCK. WHEN THE FIRST NIGHT OF SUMMER ARRIVES AND THE CLAN NEEDS TO MAKE ITS HIGHLY POTENT ??FARRELL WINE? MEMBERS DO NOT HESITATE TO RIDE DIRECTLY INTO THE LOCAL BIG BOX STORE ON THEIR ATVS AND TAKE ALL THE YEAST AND CIGARETTES THEY DESIRE. THEY KNOW THAT AS LONG AS THEY DON??T HURT ANYONE OR TAKE ANY GUNS??THOUGH SOMEHOW CROSSBOWS ARE OK??NO ONE WILL DARE PRESS CHARGES. WHEN THE OREGON MILITIA PARALLELS COME UP MATTEI IS QUICK TO DEFEND HIS CHARACTERS WHOM HE SAYS RESIDE SOMEWHERE IN THE GRAY AREA BETWEEN HEROES AND VILLAINS. ??THE FARRELLS ARE NOT TRYING TO TAKE AWAY SOMEONE ELSE??S LAND WHETHER IT??S GOVERNMENT LAND OR PRIVATE LAND OR WHATEVER? HE SAYS. ??THE FARRELLS HAVE BEEN LIVING ON THAT MOUNTAIN FOR OVER 200 YEARS AND THEY??RE JUST TRYING TO HOLD ONTO IT. SO I THINK THERE IS A HUGE DIFFERENCE THERE.? MATTEI SAYS THAT HE ORIGINALLY ENVISIONED THE SHOW AS PORTRAYING THE ??STRUGGLE BETWEEN HAVES AND HAVE-NOTS? WHICH HE VIEWS TO BE THE ??MAJOR NARRATIVE OF OUR TIME.? HE DESCRIBES THE FARRELL FAMILY AS A ??MASH-UP OF A HILLBILLY CLAN SOME GYPSIES A BIKER GANG AND A HIPPIE COMMUNE.? IN SOME WAYS HE SAYS THEY REPRESENT AS MUCH AN ??OBVIOUS FANTASY? AS THE VARIOUS HOUSES IN GAME OF THRONES. AT ONE POINT IN THE PILOT THE CLAN BURNS AN ENORMOUS WOODEN STRUCTURE OF A WOLF A CLEAR ALLUSION TO THE ANNUAL BURNING MAN FESTIVAL WHICH ALSO ESCHEWS THE USE OF THE MONEY. BECAUSE THE IDEA WAS SO ??WEIRD? MATTEI WROTE THE SCRIPT BEFORE TRYING TO PITCH IT TO NETWORKS. ??I KIND OF JUST WROTE IT FOR MY OWN SATISFACTION NEVER THINKING THAT ANYBODY WOULD PUT SOMETHING LIKE THIS ON THE AIR? HE SAYS. IT WAS THE INTEREST OF MATTEI??S OLD YALE DRAMA BUDDY GIAMATTI WITH WHOM HE SHARES AN AGENT THAT HELPED GET WGN ON BOARD. AFTER THE CRITICAL SUCCESS OF LAST YEAR??S MANHATTAN THE NETWORK WAS LOOKING TO EXPAND ITS STILL-LIMITED SLATE OF ORIGINAL PROGRAMMING. SPEAKING TO ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY LAST FALL GIAMATTI SAID HE WAS DRAWN TO THE ??LIBERTARIAN? LEANINGS OF THE CENTRAL CHARACTERS. ??I REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST READ THE SCRIPT I THOUGHT ??I??VE NEVER SEEN SOMEONE BURN MONEY ON A SHOW OR IN ANYTHING AND IT??S A REALLY RADICAL ACT.??? ??IF YOU STEP BACK AND YOU LOOK AT THIS ANGRY DEBATE IN THIS COUNTRY A LOT OF TIMES IT??S ABOUT DISPOSSESSED PEOPLE BEING ANGRY AT OTHER DISPOSSESSED PEOPLE. AND NOT REALLY DIRECTING THEIR ANGRY AT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY RUNNING THINGS? MATTEI SAYS. IN THE CASE OF OUTSIDERS THE FARRELLS ARE ??LITERALLY HAVE-NOTS? ALBEIT BY CHOICE. ??AND THE TOWNSPEOPLE MOSTLY UNEMPLOYED COAL MINER TYPES HARDLY HAVE ANY MONEY EITHER? HE CONTINUES. ??THE TWO GROUPS ARE PITTED AGAINST EACH OTHER BEING MANIPULATED FROM ABOVE BY PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING TO BENEFIT FROM ALL THIS.? ,8432.0

IN FACT PALIN??S SPEECH ENDORSING DONALD TRUMP SPARKED COMEDY EVEN BEFORE SHE UTTERED A WORD. AS DAILY SHOW CO-CREATOR/COMEDIAN LIZZ WINSTEAD TWEETED:?Ÿ ??SARAH PALIN WOULD ENDORSE FLINT WATER IF IT WOULD MEAN GETTING HERSELF BACK IN THE NEWS CYCLE.? SIRIUSXM RADIO HOST AND COMEDIAN PETE DOMINICK COMMENTED SHORTLY BEFORE THE SPEECH: ??NOTHING HAS EVER MADE MORE SENSE IN POLITICS THAN SARAH PALIN??S ENDORSEMENT OF DONALD TRUMP? ADDING ??THEY HAVE A LOT IN COMMON INCLUDING THE FACT THEY CAN BOTH TALK FOR HOURS WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING AT ALL.? THEN THERE WAS COMEDIAN PATTON OSWALT WHO LAUNCHED THIS TWEET UPON HEARING THE NEWS THAT PALIN WAS ENDORSING TRUMP: ??BREAKING: WHO-GIVES-A-SHIT ALASKAN GRIFTER ENDORSES WON'T-WIN TURD CLOWN FOR PRESIDENT? AND PALIN??S SPEECH PRAISING TRUMP DIDN??T DISAPPOINT IN PROVIDING EVEN MORE COMEDY. FOR EXAMPLE THIS PALIN LINE SHOULD WIN AN AWARD FOR THE MOST CLICH?? EXPRESSIONS IN ONE SENTENCE:?Ÿ ??I AM HERE BECAUSE LIKE YOU I KNOW THAT IT IS NOW OR NEVER. I??M IN IT TO WIN IT BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN AMERICA AND WE LOVE OUR FREEDOM.? BUT AS COMEDY WRITER AND SATIRICAL COLUMNIST FOR THE NEW YORKER ANDY BOROWITZ TOLD ME ??HOW CAN YOU ??BE IN IT TO WIN IT?? WHEN YOU ARE NOT EVEN RUNNING?!? OTHER COMEDY GEMS THAT MADE US LAUGH AND PERHAPS MADE JESUS CRY INCLUDED: ??HOW ABOUT THE REST OF US? RIGHT-WINGING BITTER-CLINGING PROUD CLINGERS OF OUR GUNS OUR GOD AND OUR RELIGION AND OUR CONSTITUTION.? AND MAYBE THE MOST QUOTED LINE FROM THE SPEECH: ??NO MORE PUSSYFOOTIN?? AROUND!? IT??S NOT OFTEN A POLITICIAN COMES OUT THAT STRONGLY AGAINST PUSSYFOOTING BUT PALIN PRIDES HERSELF ON GOING ??ROGUE???WHICH I THINK IS LIKE GOING COMMANDO. DURING PALIN??S SPEECH I KEPT WAITING FOR HER TO SCREAM OUT: ??LIVE FROM NEW YORK IT??S SATURDAY NIGHT!? TINA FEY HAS PROBABLY RECEIVED NON-STOP TEXTS AND EMAILS FROM FRIENDS URGING HER TO GET THE PALIN GLASSES OUT OF STORAGE BECAUSE SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE NEEDS HER. TWITTER CERTAINLY WAS BEGGING FEY TO RETURN WITH PEOPLE LIKE ACTOR ZACH BRAFF TWEETING: ??TINA FEY IS DEF ON SNL THIS WEEKEND.? BUT WHAT SURPRISED ME WAS THAT BY WEDNESDAY WHEN I REACHED OUT TO VARIOUS COMEDY WRITERS AND COMEDIANS THEIR ENTHUSIASM FOR PALIN??S RETURN WAS MORE MUTED THAN I EXPECTED. MILES KAHN FORMER DAILY SHOW PRODUCER AND NOW EXECUTIVE PRODUCER OF TBS??S NEW SHOW FULL FRONTAL WITH SAMANTHA BEE SHRUGGED IT OFF NOTING THAT PALIN IS ??A PUNCHLINE TO A PUNCHLINE AT THIS POINT.? POLITICAL COMEDIAN AND LONG TIME DAILY SHOW CORRESPONDENT LEWIS BLACK WAS ALSO FAR FROM JUMPING FOR JOY OVER PALIN??S RETURN. RATHER HE WAS MORE PHILOSOPHICAL TELLING ME ??WITH NEWS LIKE THIS IF ONE CAN CALL THIS NEWS EVERYDAY IT BECOMES CLEARER?ŸTHAT WE ARE LIVING AT THE?ŸINTERSECTION OF REALITY AND SATIRE.? BOROWITZ WHO CALLED TRUMP AND PALIN ??RAPTURE READY REALITY SHOW STARS? NOTED THAT EVEN IF COMEDIANS ARE EXCITED ABOUT PALIN THE REALITY IS SHE IS A ??QUITTER? AND COULD BAIL AT ANY MOMENT. BOROWITZ CORRECTLY NOTED THAT PALIN DIDN??T EVEN SHOW UP FOR HER FIRST TRUMP RALLY SCHEDULED FOR WEDNESDAY MORNING. AND A FEW OTHER COMEDIANS I APPROACHED DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO DISCUSS PALIN BECAUSE THEY WERE OVER HER YEARS AGO.?Ÿ THIS IS A FAR CRY FROM 2008 WHEN WE FIRST MET PALIN. WITH GEORGE W. BUSH??S PRESIDENCY COMING TO AN END COMEDIANS WERE FRANTICALLY LOOKING FOR A POLITICAL FIGURE WHO COULD REPLACE HIM IN TERMS OF GENERATING MATERIAL. (IN REALITY NO ONE EVER WILL.) ?ŸMANY OF US THEN LOOKED TO PALIN WHO WAS LIKE BUSH BUT WITH LIPSTICK. BUT THE REALITY NOW IS THAT EXCEPT FOR A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF REPUBLICANS PALIN IS TRULY YESTERDAY??S NEWS. AFTER ALL SHE WAS DUMPED FROM FOX NEWS AS A CONTRIBUTOR EARLIER THIS YEAR. AND A 2015 POLL FOUND PALIN ONLY HAD ABOUT A 27 PERCENT FAVORABILITY RATING AMONG REPUBLICANS. (AMONG ALL AMERICANS HER FAVORABLE RATINGS IS UNDERWATER AT NEGATIVE 24 POINTS.) I DOUBT MANY PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO SUPPORT A CANDIDATE JUST BECAUSE PALIN ENDORSES HIM OR HER.?Ÿ BUT I WILL SAY IF YOU WERE WAITING FOR PALIN TO TELL YOU WHO TO VOTE FOR YOU SHOULD NEVER BE ALLOWED TO VOTE AGAIN. I??M OPPOSED TO VOTER ID LAWS BUT I NOW FAVOR VOTER IQ LAWS. OF COURSE TRUMP'S OWN INTERNAL CALCULATIONS HAVE LED HIM TO CONCLUDE THAT PALIN ADDS SOMETHING TO HIS CAMPAIGN BY BEING ON STAGE WITH HIM. (MAYBE IT MAKES HIM FEEL LIKE A GENIUS.) ?ŸTHE BIG QUESTION IS: WILL PALIN HELP TRUMP IN THE LONG RUN? MAYBE MAYBE NOT. BUT WHILE MANY COMEDIANS MAY HAVE CELEBRATED PALIN??S RETURN TO THE NATIONAL STAGE WITH JOKES ON TUESDAY NIGHT IT APPEARED BY WEDNESDAY THINGS HAD CHANGED. PALIN??S NAME WAS NO LONGER TRENDING ON SOCIAL MEDIA AS IT HAD ON TUESDAY. IT HAD BEEN QUICKLY REPLACED BY THE COMMENTS OF FOX NEWS?? CURRENT CONTRIBUTOR STACEY DASH WHO WANTS TO END BLACK HISTORY MONTH AND ABOLISH BET BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT IT WOULD LEAD TO SEGREGATION. AND NOW IT WAS DASH NOT PALIN WHO WAS THE FOCUS OF COMEDIANS?? JIBES. IT SEEMS THAT EIGHT YEARS AFTER WE FIRST MET PALIN NOT ONLY ARE MOST AMERICANS INCLUDING FOX NEWS NO LONGER INTERESTED IN PALIN SHE HAS EVEN LOST THE INTEREST OF HER LAST CONSTITUENCY: THE COMEDIANS. ,11797.0

THE BURRITO GIANT??S PLANS TO REGAIN GROUND AFTER LAST YEAR??S E. COLI OUTBREAK WERE FOILED ON WEDNESDAY BY AN SEC FILING IN WHICH THE COMPANY ADMITTED THAT ITS FOURTH-QUARTER SALES WERE LOWER THAN EXPECTED AND REVEALED THAT IT HAS BEEN SERVED WITH A SUBPOENA FOR A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION INVOLVING A NOROVIRUS OUTBREAK AT A CALIFORNIA LOCATION LAST AUGUST. IN EARLY DECEMBER CHIPOTLE PREDICTED AN 8 TO 11 PERCENT FOURTH-QUARTER SALES DROP TO RESULT FROM THE CDC??S INVESTIGATION OF AN E. COLI OUTBREAK CONNECTED TO RESTAURANTS IN SEVERAL STATES. THAT INVESTIGATION EVENTUALLY ENCOMPASSED OVER 50 CASES OF FOODBORNE ILLNESS IN NINE STATES MOST OF WHICH WERE REPORTED TO HAVE BEGUN IN OCTOBER 2015. THEN ON DEC. 21 THE CDC ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS INVESTIGATING A MORE RECENT OUTBREAK OF A DIFFERENT STRAIN OF E. COLI WITH START DATES AS LATE AS NOV. 26 2015. THAT INVESTIGATION IS STILL ONGOING. NOW THE SEC FILING HAS REVEALED THE POTENTIAL TOLL OF THE COMPANY??S YEAR-END WOES: A FOURTH-QUARTER SALES DROP OF 14.6 PERCENT. IN DECEMBER ALONE COMPARABLE RESTAURANT SALES WERE DOWN A FULL 30 PERCENT AFTER TRENDING AS LOW AS NEGATIVE 37 PERCENT ??FOLLOWING THIS [DEC. 21] ANNOUNCEMENT AND RELATED NATIONAL MEDIA ATTENTION.? IN ADDITION THE SEC FILING NOTES THAT THE COMPANY HAS INCURRED ONE-TIME EXPENSES BETWEEN $14 MILLION AND $16 MILLION DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER INCLUDING ??COSTS TO REPLACE FOOD IN SELECT RESTAURANTS LAB ANALYSIS OF FOOD SAMPLES AND ENVIRONMENTAL SWABS INCREASED MARKETING EXPENSES RETAINING EXPERT ADVISORY SERVICES RELATED TO EPIDEMIOLOGY AND FOOD SAFETY AND PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES FOR LEGAL CLAIMS AND RELATED EXPENSES.? MUCH LIKE GUAC A FOOD SAFETY CRISIS COSTS EXTRA. CHIPOTLE??S STOCK TOOK A DIVE FOLLOWING THE NEWS BUT THE SEC FILING ALSO NOTES THAT THE COMPANY??S BOARD HAS AUTHORIZED A $300 MILLION BUYBACK PROGRAM. THAT??S IN ADDITION TO THE 609000 SHARES OF ITS STOCK THAT THE COMPANY ALREADY REPURCHASED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $556 PER SHARE. MOST OF THOSE SHARES WERE BOUGHT BACK DURING DECEMBER AS THE COMPANY ENDURED ITS PR CRISIS AND WENT ON A PUBLIC APOLOGY TOUR. MOST ALARMING TO INVESTORS AND WARY CUSTOMERS HOWEVER WAS THE COMPANY??S ADMISSION THAT IT WAS SERVED LAST MONTH WITH A FEDERAL GRAND JURY SUBPOENA FOR A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION CONDUCTED JOINTLY BY THE U.S. ATTORNEY??S OFFICE FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA AND THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION??S OFFICE OF CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS. ??THE SUBPOENA REQUIRES US TO PRODUCE A BROAD RANGE OF DOCUMENTS RELATED TO A CHIPOTLE RESTAURANT IN SIMI VALLEY CALIFORNIA THAT EXPERIENCED AN ISOLATED NOROVIRUS INCIDENT DURING AUGUST 2015? THE FILING NOTED. SPOKESPEOPLE FOR THE U.S. ATTORNEY??S OFFICE AND THE FDA DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE INVESTIGATION OR PROVIDE ANY FURTHER DETAILS ALTHOUGH THE LATTER STRESSED ITS COMMITMENT TO ??PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH? AND INVESTIGATING FOODBORNE ILLNESS OUTBREAKS. CHIPOTLE SPOKESPERSON CHRIS ARNOLD TOLD THE DAILY BEAST ??AS A MATTER OF POLICY WE DO NOT DISCUSS DETAILS SURROUNDING PENDING LEGAL ACTIONS BUT WE WILL COOPERATE FULLY WITH THE INVESTIGATION.? WHATEVER THE NATURE OF THE INVESTIGATION IT PERTAINS TO OUTBREAK OF NOROVIRUS A HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS STOMACH ILLNESS AT A CHIPOTLE RESTAURANT IN THE SIMI VALLEY TOWN CENTER SHOPPING MALL IN AUGUST 2015. NOROVIRUS AND E. COLI ARE SEPARATE ILLNESSES ALTHOUGH BOTH CAN RESULT FROM UNSANITARY FOOD HANDLING. AS FOOD SAFETY NEWS (FSN) REPORTED AT THE TIME 99 PEOPLE REPORTED FALLING ILL AFTER EATING AT THAT LOCATION. THE VENTURA COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT SAID THAT NUMBER INCLUDED 82 CUSTOMERS AND 17 EMPLOYEES SOME OF WHOM WENT TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM. ??I WAS THROWING UP A LOT? ONE AFFECTED CUSTOMER TOLD A LOCAL CBS AFFILIATE. ??MY AUNT WHO WORKS IN THE ER TOLD ME 19 PEOPLE CAME IN THE NIGHT I GOT SICK WITH FOOD POISONING.? THE VENTURA COUNTY ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH DIVISION INVESTIGATED THE RESTAURANT AND FOUND SEVERAL VIOLATIONS INCLUDING UNSANITARY PREMISES UNCLEAN EQUIPMENT FLYING INSECTS UNAUTHORIZED FOOD HANDLERS EQUIPMENT BEING DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO THE SEWER AND UNCLEAN RESTROOMS. ACCORDING TO FSN THE RESTAURANT CLOSED FOR AN AFTERNOON CLEANED UP BROUGHT IN NEW FOOD AND REOPENED THE NEXT DAY FOR LUNCH. ON TOP OF THE DECEMBER 2015 NOROVIRUS INCIDENT WHICH AFFECTED 120 BOSTONIANS INCLUDING SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE BOSTON COLLEGE MEN??S BASKETBALL TEAM THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION INTO THIS RELATIVELY UNDERPUBLICIZED SIMI VALLEY OUTBREAK IS ILL-TIMED INDEED. THE BOSTON INCIDENT HAS SO FAR NOT RESULTED IN ANY CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION BUT THE CIVIL SUITS HAVE ALREADY BEGUN WITH ONE MOTHER SUING THE RESTAURANT ON BEHALF OF HER 16-YEAR-OLD SON. MORE LITIGATION IS EXPECTED TO FOLLOW. JUDGING FROM ITS SEC FILING CHIPOTLE IS DIGGING IN FOR POTENTIALLY COSTLY LEGAL BATTLES. IN ADDITION TO SPENDING MONEY FOR ??PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES FOR LEGAL CLAIMS? THE COMPANY NOTED THAT ??[I]T IS NOT POSSIBLE AT THIS TIME TO DETERMINE WHETHER WE WILL INCUR OR TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF ANY FINES PENALTIES OR FURTHER LIABILITIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE INVESTIGATION.? UNTIL MORE DETAILS EMERGE IT??S HARD TO KNOW EXACTLY HOW BIG OF A BITE THIS LATEST NEWS WILL TAKE OUT OF CHIPOTLE??S ALREADY DIMINISHED PUBLIC IMAGE.

RIGHT BEHIND YOUTUBE PRANKS IN WHICH PARENTS PRETEND TO KILL THEIR OWN CHILDREN STEREOTYPE-WORSHIPPING ??SHIT PEOPLE SAY? VIDEOS AND FAST-MOTION COOKING TUTORIALS FOR DISHES THAT ARE ALMOST ALWAYS WRAPPED IN BACON STAGED ??FIRST TIME? VIDEOS ARE THE NEW WORST GENRE OF CLICKBAIT. AND THAT GENRE HAS FINALLY REACHED ITS AWFUL APOTHEOSIS WITH THE NOW-TRENDING ??LESBIANS TOUCH PENIS FOR THE FIRST TIME? PRODUCED BY LESBIAN SINGING DUO BRIA AND CHRISSY AND FAST APPROACHING ITS FIRST MILLION VIEWS. IF YOU HAVEN??T SEEN IT YET DON??T FEEL OBLIGED TO ADD TO THAT NUMBER. YOU ALREADY KNOW EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW FROM ITS TITLE. THREE LESBIANS ALL OF THEM YOUTUBE STARS IN THEIR OWN RIGHT FONDLE THE GENITALS OF AN ATTRACTIVE GAY MAN WHO SMILES COMPLIANTLY LAUGHS OCCASIONALLY AND NEVER SAYS A WORD. ??OOH IT??S SOFTER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE? SAYS ONE AS SHE TOUCHES HIM BELOW THE WAIST. ??IT FEELS LIKE PLAY-DOH THAT??S BEEN WARMED UP.? OVER THE COURSE OF THREE ETERNAL MINUTES HIS ANATOMY IS ALSO DESCRIBED AS A HOT DOG THAT??S BEEN LEFT OUT TOO LONG AND AS A NOODLE ??BUT NOT LIKE THE NOODLE YOU PLAY IN THE WATER WITH BUT LIKE THE NOODLE THAT YOU GET AT AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT.? ANOTHER LESBIAN MOVES HIS PENIS AROUND ASKING HIM IF IT HURTS WHEN SHE DOES. IF THIS WEREN??T BEING FILMED AS PART OF A SHAMELESS BID FOR EYEBALLS IT WOULD BE A PRETTY DEHUMANIZING SITUATION. AS IT STANDS HUFFPO COSMO AND DAILY MAIL HAVE ALREADY WRITTEN IT UP APPROVINGLY WITH MANY MORE MEDIA OUTLETS TO FOLLOW. THE NEVER-ENDING CHASE FOR CLICKS CONTINUES. THINGS DIDN??T HAVE TO GET THIS BAD. WE COULD HAVE CUT OFF THE POINTLESS PROLIFERATION OF VOYEURISTIC ??FIRST TIME? VIDEOS AT THE PASS BEFORE ??LESBIANS TOUCH PENIS FOR THE FIRST TIME? BECAME THE VIRAL SENSATION DU JOUR OR EVEN BEFORE THE SAME SINGING DUO MADE ??GAY MEN TOUCH BOOBS FOR THE FIRST TIME? LAST NOVEMBER WITH SIMILARLY INANE RESULTS. BUT WE DIDN??T AND NOW WELL HERE WE ARE. IT ALL STARTED SO INNOCENTLY. FIRST OUR FACEBOOK FRIENDS INVITED US TO WATCH BABIES TRYING LEMONS FOR THE FIRST TIME AND WE COMPLIED. THE VIDEOS WERE CUTE AND JUDGING BY THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF VIEWS THEY HAVE SINCE ACCRUED THEY WERE ALMOST UNIVERSALLY BELOVED. FEW SOURCES OF HUMOR TRANSLATE ACROSS LANGUAGES AND CULTURES BUT A CHILD SHUDDERING AT THE TASTE OF CITRUS IS ONE OF THEM. THEN ABOUT A YEAR AGO BUZZFEED BEGAN CONDUCTING A MEANINGLESS SET OF SOCIAL EXPERIMENTS NOT ON BABIES BUT ON ADULTS WHOM WE CAN ONLY HOPE ARE NOT THEIR INTERNS ALL UNDER THE GUISE OF GETTING PEOPLE TO TRY NEW THINGS. AND THAT??S WHEN THESE VIDEOS BECOME INESCAPABLE. THE FULL LIST OF SITUATIONS THAT BUZZFEED HAS STAGED IN THE NAME OF NOVELTY IS STAGGERING IN ITS SADISM. TO DATE THE MEDIA COMPANY HAS MADE MEN WEAR MAXI PADS SPRAY-TANNED REDHEADS ASKED EACH GENDER TO TRY ON THE OTHER??S UNDERWEAR SEVERAL TIMES FILMED WOMEN LIFTING WEIGHTS WITH THEIR VAGINAS EXPOSED PEOPLE TO TEMPERATURES BELOW MINUS 200 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT AND TWICE PUT PAIRS OF BEST FRIENDS BEHIND CURTAINS SO THEY COULD COMMENT ON EACH OTHER??S NAKED BODIES. WOULD THAT THE LIST ENDED THERE. BUT ACCORDING TO A BUZZFEED-MADE YOUTUBE PLAYLIST THEY HAVE CREATED DOZENS AND DOZENS OF THESE VIDEOS. ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS BUZZFEED HAS FILMED WOMEN URINATING STANDING UP FOR VIDEOS WITH OVER 12 MILLION COLLECTIVE VIEWS. THEY HAVE ASKED EXES TO CUDDLE WITH EACH OTHER AFTER BREAKING UP AND SOLICITED STRANGERS AND STRAIGHT MEN TO KISS ON CAMERA. SHOWING PEOPLE PORN IS ANOTHER FAVORITE THEME. ONCE THEY EVEN ASKED THREE YOUNG PEOPLE TO LIVE IN SIMULATED SOLITARY CONFINEMENT FOR 24 HOURS IN ORDER TO MAKE A STATEMENT ABOUT PRISON CONDITIONS. THE CONCLUSION: THEY ARE BAD. IN 1971 PHIL ZIMBARDO HAD TO GET A GRANT FROM THE GOVERNMENT TO CONDUCT HIS INFAMOUS STANFORD PRISON EXPERIMENT. TODAY HE COULD JUST TELL ATTRACTIVE TWENTY-SOMETHINGS THAT HE??LL BE PUTTING THE RESULTS UP ON YOUTUBE AND INCLUDING A LINK TO THEIR CHANNEL. IT??S SAFE TO SAY AS AFTERELLEN EDITOR-IN-CHIEF TRISH BENDIX OBSERVED OF THE LESBIAN PENIS-TOUCHING STUNT THAT THESE VIDEOS AREN??T REALLY TEACHING US ANYTHING NEW. CUDDLING WITH YOUR EX IS AWKWARD. WHO KNEW? STRAIGHT MEN DON??T NORMALLY KISS EACH OTHER BUT THEY ARE STILL PHYSICALLY CAPABLE OF DOING IT WITHOUT THEIR FACES MELTING OFF IN THE PROCESS. WHAT A SURPRISE! THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE IS VAST AND VARIED BUT ??FIRST TIME? VIDEOS AREN??T EXACTLY BRINGING IT TO LIGHT. EVEN AS ENTERTAINMENT THEY ARE VAGUELY UNCOMFORTABLE LIKE WATCHING FULL-GROWN ADULTS COMPLETE DARES THAT WE ALL SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN OUT OF OUR SYSTEM AS SIXTH-GRADERS. TO BE FAIR THIS TREND ISN??T ALL BUZZFEED??S FAULT ALTHOUGH THEIR SUBGENRE OF PEOPLE SAMPLING AMERICANIZED VERSIONS OF FOOD FROM THEIR COUNTRY OF ORIGIN??MEXICANS EATING TACO BELL ITALIANS TRYING OLIVE GARDEN CHINESE PEOPLE HAVING THEIR FIRST PANDA EXPRESS EXPERIENCE??DESERVES SPECIAL MENTION FOR CLOGGING FACEBOOK FEEDS FAR AND WIDE. WHO COULD HAVE GUESSED THAT MASS-PRODUCED CASUAL FARE WOULD FAIL TO CAPTURE THE FLAVOR OF HOME-COOKED FOOD? SHOCKER. NO THE THRILL OF WATCHING OTHER PEOPLE HAVE NEW EXPERIENCES IS SO TANTALIZING THAT YOUTUBERS OF ALL STRIPES HAVE SHOWN UP TO RAKE IN THE VIEWS. ONE YOUTUBE CHANNEL FILMED BLACK GIRLS KISSING WHITE GUYS AND WHITE GIRLS KISSING BLACK GUYS TO THE TUNE OF SEVERAL MILLION VIEWS. AND IN 2014 DAVEY WAVEY A GAY YOUTUBER WITH NEARLY A MILLION SUBSCRIBERS MADE ONE OF THE MOST BIZARRE AND SUCCESSFUL ??FIRST TIME? VIDEOS SO FAR. HE POSTED AN AD ON CRAIGSLIST ASKING FOR WOMEN WHO HAD NEVER SEEN THEIR VAGINAS MIRACULOUSLY FOUND FOUR PEOPLE WHO DID NOT THINK HE WAS A SERIAL KILLER AND FILMED THEIR REACTIONS AS THEY HAD AN EVE ENSLER MOMENT WITH A MIRROR INSIDE A BOOTH IN HIS STUDIO. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE INSPIRATIONAL AND SEVERAL OUTLETS DESCRIBED IT AS SUCH BUT I MOSTLY FELT DISQUIETED BY THIS BRAVE NEW WORLD IN WHICH WOMEN HELP A CRAIGSLIST STRANGER PROCURE AD REVENUE BY TALKING ABOUT THEIR GENITALS IN A MAKESHIFT NECK-HIGH CHANGING ROOM. POSTSCRIPT: THE NEXT YEAR MR. WAVEY DID SOME ??FIRST TIME? VAGINA VIEWING OF HIS OWN WHEN TWO OF HIS FEMALE FRIENDS DROPPED THEIR PANTS SO HE COULD CHECK THINGS OUT FOR HIMSELF. BUT MAYBE NOW THAT ??LESBIANS TOUCH PENIS FOR THE FIRST TIME? IS BEHIND US WE CAN PUT THE WHOLE ENTERPRISE TO BED. THE SHARK HAS OFFICIALLY BEEN JUMPED EVERY LAST ONE OF OUR ADOLESCENT CURIOSITIES HAS BEEN SATISFIED AND ALL THINGS THAT CAN BE EXPERIENCED EACH HAVE THEIR OWN YOUTUBE VIDEO.

ROBERT GATES TRASHES DONALD TRUMP DOUBTS OBAMA??S SPUNK,ROBERT GATES 72 YEARS OLD AND WIDELY RECOGNIZED THESE DAYS AS ONE OF THE FEW ??WISE MEN? LEFT AROUND WASHINGTON DOESN??T HAVE MUCH GOOD TO SAY ABOUT THE CURRENT CROP OF PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES. WHEN IT COMES TO CONFRONTING THE SO-CALLED ISLAMIC STATE AND OTHER JIHADISTS THE FORMER CIA CHIEF AND DEFENSE SECRETARY TOLD THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS IN NEW YORK LAST WEEK ??I THINK MIDDLE SCHOOL KIDS WOULD BE EMBARRASSED BY THE LEVEL OF DIALOGUE GOING ON IN THE NATIONAL CAMPAIGN.? ??I THINK THAT THESE GUYS MEN AND WOMEN ARE MAKING THESE BROAD PRONOUNCEMENTS [AND] IT??S CLEAR THEY DON??T KNOW WHAT THEY??RE TALKING ABOUT? GATES SAID CITING SOME OF THE MORE OUTRAGEOUS REMARKS ABOUT MAKING ??THE SAND GLOW? ??CARPET BOMBING? AND ??BOMBING THE SHIT OUT OF THEM? WHICH HE ATTRIBUTED TO ??THE LEADING CANDIDATE? MEANING DONALD TRUMP. ??THIS IS NOT A PARTICULARLY SOPHISTICATED ANALYSIS OF THE CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE? GATES TOLD THE THINK TANK??S AUDIENCE AMID CONSIDERABLE LAUGHTER. ??THE WORRYING THING IS [IF] THEY ACTUALLY BELIEVE WHAT THEY ARE SAYING AND IF THAT IS THE CASE WE REALLY ARE IN TROUBLE SO WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE THE OPTIMISTIC INTERPRETATION IS THEY??RE JUST BEING CYNICAL AND OPPORTUNISTIC.? BUT GATES WHO SERVED PRESIDENT OBAMA AS DEFENSE SECRETARY DURING THE FIRST TERM DEALT FRANKLY WITH SOME OF NO-DRAMA OBAMA??S FAILINGS AS WELL. ??I THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT ALL ALONG HAS UNDERESTIMATED ISIS HAS UNDERESTIMATED THE DEGREE OF FEAR THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO PROVOKE AMONG A LOT OF AMERICANS? GATES SAID. ??THE PRESIDENT I THINK HAS COMPLETELY MISREAD THE PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT OF THESE LONE WOLF ATTACKS OR THESE ??SMALL-SCALE ATTACKS?? THAT RESULT IN MULTIPLE CASUALTIES THAT HAVE BEEN SPONSORED BY ISIS OR BY PEOPLE RADICALIZED BY ISIS AND ACTING AS LONE WOLVES.? THIS QUESTION OF UNDERESTIMATED THREATS AND MISREAD REACTIONS IN FACT HAS BEEN A PROBLEM ACROSS THE BOARD FOR THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION??S FOREIGN POLICY PARTICULARLY IN RECENT YEARS. SO ON SATURDAY WHEN THE EVER-ACTIVE GATES WAS SNOWED IN A BLOCK FROM THE WHITE HOUSE WHERE HE HAD DISPENSED INFORMATION AND VITAL INSIGHTS TO EIGHT PRESIDENTS I GAVE HIM A CALL TO TRY TO FIND OUT WHY OBAMA HAS BEEN SURPRISED AGAIN AND AGAIN BY DICTATORS AND INDEED TERRORISTS AROUND THE WORLD. GATES NURSING A BIT OF A COLD MAINLY WANTED TO TALK ABOUT HIS NEW BOOK A PASSION FOR LEADERSHIP: LESSONS ON CHANGE AND REFORM FROM FIFTY YEARS OF PUBLIC SERVICE. BUT YOU CAN??T TALK ABOUT LEADERSHIP IN THE UNITED STATES AND ESPECIALLY IN FOREIGN POLICY WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT CURRENT AND FUTURE PRESIDENTS. AND GATES NAILED THE PROBLEM WITH OBAMA: HE IS A HYPER-RATIONALIST IN WHAT??S STILL AN IRRATIONAL WORLD. THE VIEW IT SHOULD BE SAID IS NOT UNIQUE TO GATES. AS A LONGTIME COLLEAGUE OF HIS AT THE CIA OBSERVED IN PRIVATE A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO IT MAY BE WISE TO KEEP ONE??S ADVERSARIES OFF BALANCE AND GUESSING JUST HOW CRAZY YOU MIGHT BE. ONE REMEMBERS PRESIDENT NIXON??S FAMOUS AND INFAMOUS ??MADMAN THEORY? TRYING TO CONVINCE THE NORTH VIETNAMESE IN 1968 THAT HE ??MIGHT DO ANYTHING TO STOP THE WAR? THAT WAS RAGING IN SOUTHEAST ASIA. IN THE 1980S THE RUSSIANS REALLY WERE UNSURE HOW FAR PRESIDENT REAGAN WOULD PUSH THEM ON LAND AT SEA IN THE AIR AND MOST IMPORTANT IN OUTER SPACE. PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH ONE MIGHT ARGUE TOOK THE MADMAN THEORY FAR TOO FAR LAUNCHING A WAR IN IRAQ THAT PROVED INSANELY DESTRUCTIVE TO U.S. INTERESTS. OBAMA ON THE OTHER HAND IS A ??MATURE MEASURED RESPONSIBLE INDIVIDUAL? AS THE VETERAN SPOOK PUT IT. ??AND VLADIMIR PUTIN AND XI JINPING AND ABU BAKR AL-BAGHDADI??THEY DON??T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT MATURE MEASURED AND RESPONSIBLE.? GATES RATHER MORE ELEGANTLY MADE MUCH THE SAME ARGUMENT OVER THE PHONE. ??I THINK THAT PHILOSOPHICALLY THE PRESIDENT AND [SECRETARY OF STATE] JOHN KERRY HAVE BELIEVED THAT THEY WERE AT A POINT IN HISTORY WHERE THE RULE OF LAW AND RATIONAL DECISION MAKING ON THESE ISSUES AND A NATION??S GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF ITS LONG TERM NATIONAL INTEREST WOULD PREVAIL? GATES TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. ??BUT THAT CERTAINLY DOES NOT APPLY TO MOST OF THE REST OF THE WORLD WHERE YOU HAVE LEADERS WHO FRANKLY ARE STUCK IN A 19TH-20TH CENTURY APPROACH TO ADVANCING THEIR NATIONS?? INTERESTS AND DEFENDING THEIR NATIONS?? INTERESTS? GATES SAID. ??AND FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE PERSON WHO IS LOGICAL AND RATIONAL YOU ASK YOURSELF ??WHY ARE THEY DOING THAT? THAT MAKES NO SENSE WHATSOEVER.??? THE PROBLEM IS NOT NEW. GATES REMEMBERED THAT WHEN HE WAS AT THE CIA IN 1979 THE CONSENSUS AT THE AGENCY WAS THAT THE RUSSIANS WOULD NOT INVADE AFGHANISTAN. THERE WAS NO REASON FOR THEM TO DO IT. OBVIOUSLY IT WOULD BE A HUGE MISTAKE. SO EVEN THOUGH MOSCOW HAD 30000 TO 40000 TROOPS READY TO CROSS THE BORDER THE CIA CONCLUDED ??WE DON??T THINK THEY??LL DO IT.? BUT OF COURSE THEY DID. SIMILAR UNREAL REALISM AFFLICTS OBAMA AND KERRY ACCORDING TO GATES: ??I JUST THINK THAT THERE??S A SENSE IN THEIR MINDS THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS ADVANCED TO THAT KIND OF A RATIONAL ASSESSMENT OF ITS NATIONAL INTERESTS??AND ??WHY ISN??T EVERYBODY ELSE LINING UP??? AND IT??S BECAUSE NEARLY EVERYBODY ELSE IS STUCK IN AN OLD PARADIGM.? HOW DO YOU CHANGE THAT? DO WE WANT CREDIBLY CRAZY PEOPLE IN OFFICE? (THE VETERAN SPOOK HAD SUGGESTED TRUMP MIGHT QUALIFY ON THAT COUNT.) AGAIN GATES??S RESPONSE WAS MORE MEASURED. ??YOU HAVE TO START WITH WHAT IS LOGICAL AND SENSIBLE AND WHAT??S COMMON SENSE? HE SAID. ??BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO PRESENT YOUR POLICIES??YOU HAVE TO TALK ABOUT YOUR POLICIES??IN A WAY THAT ADDRESSES THESE 19TH- AND 20TH-CENTURY APPROACHES TO PROBLEM SOLVING.? CASE IN POINT: IRAN. ??YOU MAY DECIDE THAT A NUCLEAR ACCORD WITH IRAN IS ENTIRELY IN EVERYBODY??S INTERESTS INCLUDING OURS AND THE IRANIANS??? SAID GATES. ??BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU REALIZE THAT THERE IS A POWER STRUGGLE GOING ON CONTINUALLY IN IRAN AND YOU BASICALLY ANNOUNCE IN PARALLEL WITH THE ARMS CONTROL AGREEMENT ??AND OH BY THE WAY HERE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE ARE GOING TO DO TO STRENGTHEN OUR MILITARY PRESENCE AND INCREASE OUR ENGAGEMENT IN THE REGION AS A WAY OF REASSURING OUR FRIENDS AND ALLIES IN THE REGION.??? ARGUABLY THAT??S WHAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE OR THINKS IT HAS DONE BUT AS GATES SEES IT THERE??S NOT A SHARP ENOUGH EDGE. THE STAND CONFRONTING IRANIAN ADVENTURISM OUTSIDE THE FRAMEWORK OF THE NUCLEAR AGREEMENT ??HAS BEEN VERY WEAK? SAID GATES. HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE ??SOMETHING MUCH BROADER THAN JUST MORE SPECIAL OPS FORCES TO FIGHT ISIS AND SO ON. I AM TALKING ABOUT A MAJOR U.S. INITIATIVE IN TERMS OF AN INCREASED MILITARY PRESENCE INCREASED MILITARY SUPPORT FOR OUR FRIENDS AND ALLIES A MAJOR EFFORT TO GET THEM TO WORK TOGETHER AS A REGIONAL SECURITY EFFORT AND A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY ON HOW YOU PUSH BACK AGAINST IRANIAN MEDDLING.? ??THE IRONY? SAID GATES ??IS THE AYATOLLAH [SUPREME LEADER ALI KHAMENEI] ANNOUNCED EXACTLY THAT THING ON THE IRANIAN SIDE: ??JUST BECAUSE WE SIGNED THAT AGREEMENT DON??T EXPECT US TO CHANGE ANY OF OUR BEHAVIOR. WE ARE GOING TO BE JUST AS AGGRESSIVE GOING AFTER THE GREAT SATAN.??? THE FORMER CIA CHIEF AND DEFENSE SECRETARY HAS SAID MANY TIMES THAT HE THINKS PRESIDENTS RESORT TO FORCE TOO OFTEN BUT THAT IS DISTINCT IN FACT FROM MAKING A THREAT OF FORCE CREDIBLE WHETHER IT IS IMPLICIT OR EXPLICIT. GATES LIKES TO CITE THE EXAMPLE OF PRESIDENT EISENHOWER WHO WAS THE COMMANDER OF ALLIED FORCES IN EUROPE IN WORLD WAR II THEN PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES FROM 1953 TO 1961 IN THE POTENTIALLY APOCALYPTIC EARLY DAYS OF THE COLD WAR. GATES RATTLED OFF HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS: ??EISENHOWER CAME IN FACED A RUSSIA THAT HAD JUST DEVELOPED A THERMONUCLEAR WEAPON CHINA HAD JUST DEVELOPED THEIR OWN NUCLEAR WEAPON FOR THE FIRST TIME. HE FACED A FRENCH WAR IN INDOCHINA WHERE THE [U.S] JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF UNANIMOUSLY ASKED HIM TO USE NUCLEAR WEAPONS TO HELP THE FRENCH. HE FACED REPEATED CRISES WITH CHINA OVER TAIWAN AND THE TAIWAN STRAIT. HE FACED A MIDDLE EAST WAR INVOLVING OUR CLOSEST ALLIES AND HE GOT THEM TO STOP. HE FACED REVOLUTIONS IN EAST GERMANY POLAND AND HUNGARY A REVOLUTION IN CUBA. AND YET BETWEEN THE TIME THAT HE BECAME PRESIDENT AND SIGNED THE NORTH KOREAN ARMISTICE IN THE MIDDLE OF 1953 UNTIL HE LEFT OFFICE NOT ONE AMERICAN SOLDIER WAS KILLED IN COMBAT.? ??I DON??T THINK DWIGHT EISENHOWER WAS A WIMP? SAID GATES ??AND THE FUNNY THING WAS HE DID IT ALL KIND OF EFFORTLESSLY. EVERYBODY THOUGHT ALL HE DID WAS GO OUT AND PLAY GOLF ON THE WHITE HOUSE LAWN. AND YOU KNOW THERE WASN??T A LOT OF BLUSTER OR ANYTHING HE JUST GOT IT DONE.? SO GETTING BACK TO THE CURRENT CAMPAIGN TO CHOOSE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO DOES GATES FAVOR? HE SAYS THERE MIGHT BE TWO OR THREE AMONG THE CANDIDATES ??BUT ONLY TWO OR THREE? WHO BRING THE SKILLS NEEDED AND HE??S NOT NAMING THEM. ONE MIGHT SURMISE THAT HILLARY CLINTON OR JEB BUSH COULD THEORETICALLY BE ON THE GATES SHORT LIST. BUT IT??S CLEAR THAT DONALD TRUMP IS NOT. ??IF YOU READ THE CHAPTER ON PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS I REQUIRE FOR SUCCESSFUL LEADERSHIP YOU WOULD FIND THAT HE PROBABLY DOES NOT FILL THE BILL ON A NUMBER OF THOSE COUNTS? SAID GATES. ??IT??S JUST PURE SPECULATION BUT THE KIND OF PEOPLE HE WOULD LIKELY SURROUND HIMSELF WITH: ARE THEY GOING TO BE INDEPENDENT-MINDED? AND IS HE GOING TO WELCOME CONTRARY POINTS OF VIEW AND CONSIDER THOSE CAREFULLY AND TRY AND BUILD A TEAM AND ALLOW OTHERS TO TAKE CREDIT?? DOES THAT MEAN YOU CAN??T BE A BULLY AND ALSO A GOOD LEADER? ??I DON??T THINK SO? SAID GATES. ,46303.0

IT WAS ICY COLD AND SNOWY IN MOSCOW BUT WARM AND SUNNY IN SOCHI THE BLACK SEA RESORT WHERE PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN WAS SURROUNDED WITH MAGNOLIAS PALMS AND CYPRESS TREES. HERE IN MOSCOW YOU NEEDED A THICK OVERCOAT IF YOU WANTED TO DARE A WALK IN THE SNOW WHILE IN SOCHI A SHIRT AND A LIGHT JACKET WERE GOOD ENOUGH. TRULY THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT LIVES IN HIS OWN WORLD WHOLLY DIFFERENT FROM MOST OF RUSSIA??S REALITY AND HIS WORLD OF THE MOMENT IS SUB-TROPICAL. MAYBE THE WARM AIR AND GREEN LEAVES INSPIRE OPTIMISM. CERTAINLY PRESIDENT PUTIN BEGAN THE NEW YEAR WITH A SUNNY ANALYSIS OF THE RUSSIAN ECONOMY FOR BILD ONE OF GERMANY??S LEADING NEWSPAPERS. THE PRESIDENT??S CONFIDENT STATEMENTS IN RUSSIAN WITH GERMAN PHRASES MIXED IN DESCRIBED THE COUNTRY??S BUDGET DEFICIT AS LOW NATIONAL RESERVES AS RICH AND THE COLLAPSING OIL PRICE AS HEALTHY FOR THE RUSSIAN ECONOMY. RUSSIA HAS ??OVER $300 BILLION? OF RESERVES IN THE CENTRAL BANK OF RUSSIA ON TOP OF $70 AND $80 BILLION IN THE GOVERNMENT RESERVE FUNDS PUTIN TOLD BILD IN SOCHI. SO BY PRESIDENT PUTIN??S CALCULATION RUSSIA STILL HAS ABOUT $450 BILLION IN RESERVES. EXCEPT THAT IT DOESN??T. MOSKOVSKIJ KOMSOMOLETS (MK) A NEWSPAPER READ BY NEARLY ONE THIRD OF MUSCOVITES CAME OUT WITH A HEADLINE: ??PUTIN MADE A $150 BILLION MISTAKE EVALUATING RUSSIAN RESERVES.? THE NEWSPAPER INTERVIEWED STATE EXPERTS AND INDEPENDENT FINANCIAL ANALYSTS WHO SOUNDED SURPRISED AS THE TRUE INFORMATION COULD BE FOUND ON THE GOVERNMENT WEBSITES. PUTIN??S ADVISERS MUST HAVE MISINFORMED THE PRESIDENT THE PAPER SUGGESTED. THE TRUE PICTURE DID NOT SOUND OPTIMISTIC AT ALL. RUSSIA??S ECONOMY DEPENDS ON OIL LIKE LIFE DEPENDS ON OXYGEN. IT REPRESENTS AT LEAST 15 PERCENT OF RUSSIA??S GDP. ON WEDNESDAY RUSSIA??S LEADING ECONOMISTS GATHERED TO HEAR PRIME MINISTER DMITRIY MEDVEDEV??S PREDICTIONS FOR THE STATE BUDGET THAT WAS CALCULATED ON THE BASIS OF $50 PER BARREL OF URALS OIL. BUT THE PRICE IS MORE LIKE $30 PER A BARREL. MEDVEDEV SAID THAT RUSSIA HAD TO PREPARE ITSELF ??FOR THE WORST SCENARIO? AS THEY DO THAT IN OTHER COUNTRIES. RBC REPORTED THAT IF THE OIL PRICE DROPS TO $24 PER BARREL RUSSIA??S DEFICIT MIGHT INCREASE TO 7.5 PERCENT OF GDP. ??IN FACT WE ARE NOW IN A MUCH WORSE POSITION THAN WE WERE IN 2008 WHEN OUR RESERVES WERE ACTUALLY OVER $600 BILLION AND WE HAD ONLY 15 MILLION PEOPLE LIVING IN POVERTY? ONE OF THE FORUM??S PARTICIPANTS VLADIMIR RYZHKOV TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. ??NOW WE HAVE A BIT OVER $300 BILLION IN RESERVES AND FAST GROWING POVERTY? RUSSIA??S USABLE RESERVES ARE SHRINKING AT A DANGEROUS SPEED. THE CENTRAL BANK OF RUSSIA SAID LAST YEAR THAT RUSSIAN INTERNATIONAL RESERVES AMOUNTED TO $364 BILLION IN NOVEMBER. THAT MEANS THAT THE RESERVES FELL BY OVER $150 BILLION FROM $524 BILLION SINCE OCTOBER 31 2013. IN THE YEARS SINCE CRIMEA WAS ANNEXED AND THE UKRAINE WAR BEGAN THE NUMBER OF RUSSIANS BELOW THE POVERTY LINE HAS INCREASED TO 23 MILLION. AS RYZHKOV PUT IT ??IF THE OIL PRICE STAYS AT $30 PER BARREL WE ARE GOING TO SPEND ABOUT $100 BILLION OF NATIONAL RESERVES BEFORE THE END OF 2016 AND IF IT DOES NOT GROW NEXT YEAR WE??LL GO THROUGH $200 BILLION OF THE CENTRAL BANK??S RESERVES WITH THE RUBLE DEVALUING TO OVER 100 TO 1 DOLLAR.? OPTIMISM ABOUT STABILITY IS PUTIN??S TRADEMARK AND SOMETHING THE PRESIDENT??S FANS ADMIRE HIM FOR. ??THE PRESIDENT HAS TO STAY CONFIDENT SURROUNDING HIMSELF WITH PEOPLE CAPABLE OF HOLDING POWER AND PROPERTY (THAT IS WHAT MAKES A POLITICIAN STRONG) AND NOT WITH IDEALISTS? SAID SERGEI MARKOV A MEMBER OF RULING UNITED RUSSIA PARTY AND THE PUBLIC CHAMBER. MAYBE RUSSIA??S ECONOMY COULD RECOVER IF STATE BUREAUCRATS STOPPED STEALING FROM THE RUSSIAN BUDGET? IN 2014 RUSSIA WAS 136TH OUT 175 COUNTRIES IN TRANSPARENCY INTERNATIONAL??S GLOBAL RANKING OF CORRUPTION. BUT THE KREMLIN??S LOYALISTS IMMEDIATELY SAID THAT THE RANKING WAS POLITICIZED AND THAT CORRUPTION WAS A NON-OFFICIAL DEAL BETWEEN AUTHORITIES AND LOCAL POPULATIONS. ??EVEN IF GOVERNORS AND OTHER STATE OFFICIALS ARE CORRUPT WE ARE NOT GOING TO FIGHT THAT AS A REAL WAR AGAINST CORRUPTION WOULD MEAN ANOTHER REVOLUTION AND THAT IS WHAT RUSSIAN SOCIETY DOES NOT DESIRE? MARKOV TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. THOSE WHO CRITICIZED THE PRESIDENT??S POINT OF VIEW HAVE BEEN CAST AS PROVOCATEURS OR LIARS OR FOREIGN AGENTS FIGHTING AGAINST RUSSIA IN ??THE HYBRID WAR? BEING WAGED AGAINST IT AT DIFFERENT LEVELS BY WESTERN POWERS. ON TUESDAY CHECHEN LEADER RAMZAN KADYROV DECLARED AT A PRESS CONFERENCE IN THE CHECHEN CAPITAL OF GROZNY THAT PUTIN??S CRITICS ALLEGEDLY HIRED BY FOREIGN SECRET SERVICES WERE JUMPING ALL OVER THEMSELVES TO OPPOSE PRESIDENT PUTIN. ??SUCH PEOPLE SHOULD BE TREATED AS ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE AS BETRAYERS. THEY SHOULD BE PUT ON TRIAL? KADYROV SAID. EVERY RUSSIAN KNOWS THAT STALIN EXECUTED ??ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE? SO THE WORDS SOUNDED LIFE THREATENING ESPECIALLY AFTER ONE OF THE HIGH-PROFILE CRITICS OF PUTIN??S POLITICS BORIS NEMTSOV WAS ASSASSINATED OUTSIDE THE KREMLIN??S WALL LAST FEBRUARY. ??AFTER NEMTSOV??S MURDER KADYROV??S WORDS SOUND LIKE A DIRECT THREAT? SAID RYZHKOV. ??HE SPEAKS AS A CLASSICAL DICTATOR MAO OR STALIN. ALL DICTATORS SAY THE SAME THING THAT OPPOSITION IS A NATIONAL THREAT INSPIRED BY FOREIGN POWERS. BUT RUSSIA IS A DEMOCRATIC STATE ACCORDING TO ITS CONSTITUTION AND KADYROV??S DICTATORIAL MESSAGES ARE ANTI-CONSTITUTIONAL.? DEMOCRACY MAY BE STRUGGLING BUT IT IS STILL ALIVE IN RUSSIA.

AS RECENTLY AS 2014 COFFEE CONSUMPTION WAS LINKED TO AN INCREASED RISK OF BLADDER CANCER. SO WHY TRUST THE LATEST RESEARCH?

DR. ECKEL IS ALSO QUICK TO POINT OUT THAT ALL OF THE POSITIVE EFFECTS OF COFFEE WERE ONLY SEEN IN NON-SMOKERS. OLDER STUDIES HAVE SUGGESTED THAT COMBINING COFFEE AND SMOKING CAN ACTUALLY HAVE A GREATER NEGATIVE HEALTH IMPACT THAN SMOKING ALONE AND BOTH INCREASE BLOOD PRESSURE WHICH COULD BE DANGEROUS FOR THOSE WHO ALREADY HAVE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.

FORMER U.S. OFFICIALS AND MIDDLE EAST ANALYSTS TOLD THE DAILY BEAST THAT IT??S INCONCEIVABLE THAT RIYADH COULD NOT HAVE KNOWN THAT KILLING NIMR AL-NIMR A PROMINENT CRITIC OF THE ROYAL FAMILY AND AN ICON TO SHIITE PROTESTERS ACROSS THE PERSIAN GULF REGION DURING THE ARAB SPRING UPRISINGS WOULD NOT DRAW CONDEMNATION AND POTENTIALLY A VIOLENT RESPONSE. ??THE SAUDIS CERTAINLY WERE AWARE THIS WAS GOING TO HAVE SOME DEGREE OF REACTION? MATTHEW MCINNIS A FORMER PENTAGON ANALYST AND NOW A MIDDLE EAST EXPERT AND FELLOW AT THE AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. AL-NIMR??S DEATH PROMPTED PROTESTERS TO STORM THE SAUDI EMBASSY IN TEHRAN WHICH LED TO SAUDI ARABIA SEVERING DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH THEIR PERSIAN RIVALS. MOHAMMED BIN NAYEF SAUDI ARABIA??S CROWN PRINCE AND INTERIOR MINISTER AND A CLOSE ALLY OF WASHINGTON OVERSAW THE EXECUTION SO IT COULDN??T HAVE COME AS MUCH OF A SURPRISE TO THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. BUT THE SAUDIS HAD THREATENED TO KILL AL-NIMR BEFORE ACCUSING HIM OF PROMOTING IRANIAN MEDDLING IN THE COUNTRY AND HAD ALWAYS BACKED DOWN. SO WHY FOLLOW THROUGH NOW? THE DECISION COMES AT A MOMENT WHEN THE SAUDIS HAVE SEVERAL REASONS TO FEEL VULNERABLE TO RISING IRANIAN INFLUENCE??BOTH IN THEIR COUNTRY AND ACROSS THE REGION??AND MAY NOT THINK THE U.S. IS DOING ENOUGH TO CURB IT. IT??S NOT JUST THAT IRAN HAS APPROACHED MORE NORMAL RELATIONS WITH EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES FOLLOWING A LANDMARK DEAL TO CURB IRAN??S NUCLEAR WEAPONS AMBITIONS. IN YEMEN SAUDI FORCES ARE FIGHTING IRANIAN-BACKED MILITANTS IN WHAT IS FREQUENTLY SEEN AS A PROXY WAR. AND IN IRAQ AND SYRIA THE IRANIANS ARE ALSO PLAYING AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE U.S.-LED FIGHT AGAINST ISIS. IRANIAN-BACKED SHIITE MILITIAS HAVE BEEN A KEY FIGHTING FORCE IN SEVERAL KEY BATTLES IN IRAQ. TEHRAN HAS FORGED AN ALLIANCE WITH MOSCOW THAT IS LIKELY TO HELP SHAPE THE POLITICAL FUTURE OF SYRIA AND ITS EMBATTLED PRESIDENT BASHAR AL-ASSAD. THE SAUDIS SEE NO GOOD COMING FROM THE RISE OF IRAN AS A REGIONAL POWER. ??THEY??RE IN THIS VERY INSECURE PERIOD? MCCINNIS SAID. VIEWED THROUGH THAT LENS THE EXECUTION OF AL-NIMR AFTER YEARS OF THREATS COULD BE READ AS A ??DEMONSTRATION OF STRENGTH.? BRUCE RIEDEL A FORMER CIA OFFICER AND MIDDLE EAST ANALYST AT THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTION AGREED THAT THE EXECUTION OF AL-NIMR WAS MEANT IN PART TO SEND A SIGNAL TO TEHRAN. ??I SUSPECT THEY WANTED AN IRANIAN REACTION. SALMAN IS A RISK TAKER? RIEDEL SAID REFERRING TO THE SAUDI KING. RIEDEL NOTED THAT THE SAUDI MONARCHY WAS ALSO MAKING CLEAR TO ITS OWN CITIZENS THAT IT WOULDN??T TOLERATE ANY INTERNAL POLITICAL DISSENT FOMENTED BY IRAN. INCITING A DIPLOMATIC RIFT ALSO MAY PLAY INTO RIYADH??S LONG-TERM STRATEGY OF UNDERMINING TEHRAN. ??SAUDI HAS LONG OPPOSED DIPLOMATIC INITIATIVES??BE IT IN SYRIA OR ON THE NUCLEAR ISSUE??THAT IRAN PARTICIPATED IN AND THAT RISKED NORMALIZING IRAN??S REGIONAL ROLE AND INFLUENCE? TRITA PARSI THE PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL IRANIAN AMERICAN COUNCIL TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. ??FROM THE SAUDI PERSPECTIVE GEOPOLITICAL TRENDS IN THE REGION HAVE GONE AGAINST ITS INTEREST FOR MORE THAN A DECADE NOW AND THE RISE OF IRAN??AND THE U.S. DECISION TO NEGOTIATE AND COMPROMISE WITH IRAN OVER ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM??HAS ONLY ADDED TO THE SAUDI PANIC.? PARSI NOTED THAT SAUDI ARABIA??S SEVERING OF DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH IRAN GIVES THE MONARCHY ??THE PERFECT EXCUSE TO SLOW DOWN UNDERMINE AND POSSIBLY COMPLETELY SCUTTLE? U.S.-LED TALKS PLANNED IN GENEVA LATER THIS MONTH AIMED AT REACHING A POLITICAL SETTLEMENT IN THE SYRIAN CIVIL WAR. SAUDI ARABIA HAS BEEN A RELUCTANT PARTNER IN THAT EFFORT AND ONLY JOINED AFTER THREATENING A BOYCOTT IF IRAN WAS EXCLUDED PARSI SAID. ANOTHER UNANSWERED QUESTION IS WHAT IF ANYTHING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION MAY HAVE DONE TO DETER THE SAUDIS FROM EXECUTING AL-NIMR AND SETTING OFF A REGIONAL CRISIS. WASHINGTON HADN??T MADE A STRONG PUBLIC PUSH TO STOP THE EXECUTION. AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT HASN??T CONDEMNED IT DESPITE THE FACT THAT SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES HAVE DONE SO. ON SATURDAY STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON JOHN KIRBY ISSUED A STATEMENT THAT THE UNITED STATES WAS ??PARTICULARLY CONCERNED THAT THE EXECUTION OF PROMINENT SHIA CLERIC AND POLITICAL ACTIVIST NIMR AL-NIMR RISKS EXACERBATING SECTARIAN TENSIONS AT A TIME WHEN THEY URGENTLY NEED TO BE REDUCED.? IF WASHINGTON TRIED MORE FORCEFULLY IN PRIVATE TO GET THE SAUDIS TO CHANGE COURSE THAT EFFORT OBVIOUSLY FAILED. THE SAUDIS MAY ALSO HAVE BEEN PLAYING TO A DOMESTIC AUDIENCE. AL-NIMR WAS JUST ONE OF 47 MEN PUT TO DEATH A FACT THAT HAS BEEN OVERSHADOWED IN THE DISPUTE OVER AL-NIMR. NEARLY ALL OF THEM WERE SUNNI JIHADISTS INCLUDING A GROUP THAT HAD PLOTTED TO OVERTHROW THE MONARCHY ON THE ORDERS OF OSAMA BIN LADEN. ??THIS WAS MORE FOR INTERNAL POLITICAL REASONS IT SEEMS TO ME? HENRI BARKEY THE DIRECTOR OF THE MIDDLE EAST PROGRAM AT THE WILSON CENTER TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. KILLING AL-NIMR PROVOKED IRAN BUT IT MAY ALSO HAVE PLACATED SUPPORTERS OF THOSE SUNNI JIHADISTS WHO CONTINUE TO POSE A SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO INTERNAL SECURITY. ??IF [THE SAUDIS] WERE TRYING TO DISTRACT DOMESTIC ATTENTION FROM THEM BY SACRIFICING A FEW SH??IA INCLUDING NIMR THEY??VE DONE A GOOD JOB? BARKEY SAID. ??THEY ARE MORE WORRIED ABOUT SALAFISTS [JIHADISTS] AT HOME THAN ANYTHING THE IRANIANS CAN THROW AT THEM.? ,22652.0

THEOLOGY. ??WHO AMONG US FEELS HIMSELF SO EXALTED ABOVE HIS FELLOWS AS TO HAVE A RIGHT TO DICTATE TO THEM THEIR MODE OF BELIEF?? HE THUNDERED. IN HIS ERA??S MALE-CENTERED RHETORIC HENRY CALLED SUCH PRONOUNCEMENTS ??A QUESTION BETWEEN A MAN AND HIS MAKER? BECAUSE IT ??REQUIRES MORE THAN HUMAN ATTRIBUTES TO PRONOUNCE WHICH OF THE NUMEROUS SECTS PREVAILING IN THE WORLD IS MOST ACCEPTIBLE [SIC] TO THE DEITY.? MOREOVER HENRY INSISTED DEMOCRATIC ??GOVERNMENTS ONLY CONCERN THE ACTIONS AND CONDUCT OF MAN AND NOT HIS SPECULATIVE NOTIONS.? HE INSISTED: ??IF A MAN FULFILLS THE DUTIES OF THAT RELIGION WHICH HIS EDUCATION AND CONSCIENCE HAVE [CONVINCED] HIM IS THE TRUE ONE NO PERSON?? IN THIS OUR LAND OF LIBERTY HAS A RIGHT? TO PROSECUTE HIM OR MAKE HIM ??SUFFER CIVIL DISQUALIFICATION.? THIS NOTION OF JUDGING WHAT WE DO NOT WHAT WE BELIEVE PROTECTS OUR FREEDOMS AND ENCOURAGES DIVERSITY IN THOUGHT. AT THIS POINT TWO-THIRDS OF THE WAY THROUGH THE SPEECH HENRY HAD DEFENDED THE NOTION OF FREEDOM OF WORSHIP AND CONSCIENCE GENERALLY. BUT THIS PROUD AMERICAN THIS COURAGEOUS AMERICAN JEW EMBRACED HIS RELIGION REFUSING TO COWER BEHIND GENERIC FREEDOMS FOR ALL RATHER THAN SPECIFIC FREEDOMS FOR HIM AND HIS FAITH. ??THE RELIGION I PROFESS??? HE SAID ??ENJOINS UPON ITS VOTARIES THE PRACTICE OF EVERY VIRTUE AND THE DETESTATION OF EVERY VICE.? AND THEN ARTICULATING TRADITION??S CRADLE-TO-GRAVE NURTURING HE SAID: ??THIS THEN ?? IS MY CREED IT WAS IMPRESSED UPON MY INFANT MIND IT HAS BEEN THE DIRECTOR OF MY YOUTH THE MONITOR OF MY MANHOOD AND WILL I TRUST BE THE CONSOLATION OF MY OLD AGE.? HENRY ENDED BY AFFIRMING THAT HE HAD NO NEED ??TO MAKE CONVERTS TO MY FAITH? AND EXPECTED ??THE SAME CHARITY ?? WILL BE EXTENDED TO MYSELF? MISCHIEVOUSLY QUOTING MATTHEW 7:12 ABOUT DOING UNTO OTHERS AS YOU WISH THEM TO DO UNTO YOU. AS HENRY SAT DOWN THE ENTIRE NORTH CAROLINA HOUSE OF COMMONS STOOD UP IN THE KIND OF MASS DEMONSTRATION AGAINST ANTI-SEMITISM??AND AGAINST ALL FORMS OF INJUSTICE??WE NEED IN SOME POCKETS OF AMERICA TODAY. IN TRUTH CATHOLICS HAD ALREADY SERVED AS BOTH SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE AND STATE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. RATHER THAN AMENDING THEIR STATE CONSTITUTION THE LEGISLATORS USED A LOOPHOLE DECIDING THAT A SEAT IN THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY WAS NOT WHAT THE CONSTITUTION CONSIDERED AN ??OFFICE?? OF TRUTH OR PROFIT.? NORTH CAROLINA LAW DEMANDED A PROTESTANT OATH UNTIL AFTER THE CIVIL WAR IN 1868 BUT IT WAS NOT APPLIED (AND RARELY RELEVANT). TODAY FEW REMEMBER JACOB HENRY ALTHOUGH THE SUCCESSFUL APPLICATION (PDF) TO LIST HIS HOUSE ON THE NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC PLACES NOTED TWO DISTINCTIONS. FIRST HIS HOUSE STANDS AS ??THE LARGEST AND MOST AMBITIOUS FEDERAL HOUSE IN BEAUFORT.? SECOND THE HOUSE TESTIFIES TO JACOB HENRY??S ??EARLY AND SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION IN THE STRUGGLE TO REALIZE SOME OF THE FREEDOMS PROVIDED FOR IN THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION.? WE SHOULD HONOR HIM??AND MIMIC HIS COLLEAGUES TOO??DRAMATICALLY REPUDIATING ALL BIGOTRY TODAY. ,30588.0
30,9558498.0,2016-01-02T05:01:00+00:00,ORSON WELLES??S FORGOTTEN MASTERPIECE,EVEN TODAY ORSON WELLES HAS A TROUBLED REPUTATION. THERE ARE STILL THOSE WHO WILL ARGUE THAT HE PEAKED WITH CITIZEN KANE AND NEVER FULFILLED HIS PROMISE. FRANKLY AND THIS IS NO KNOCK ON KANE BUT I FIND THAT PREPOSTEROUS. HOW CAN A MAN WHO MADE THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS TOUCH OF EVIL AND THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI??THREE OF THE GREATEST FILMS EVER MADE??BE SAID TO HAVE NOT FULFILLED HIS PROMISE? BUT EVEN SO IT IS A COMPLICATED TRACK RECORD. THERE ARE THE FILMS BUTCHERED BY THE STUDIOS INCLUDING AMBERSONS AND UNTIL RECENTLY TOUCH OF EVIL. THERE ARE FILMS SUCH AS THE TRIAL AND THE IMMORTAL STORY THAT ARE RARELY SEEN AND OTHERS SUCH AS IT??S ALL TRUE THAT WERE NEVER FINISHED. AND THEN THERE IS CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT WELLES??S MOVIE ABOUT SHAKESPEARE??S FALSTAFF WHICH HAS ALMOST NEVER BEEN SEEN AT ALL BY ANYONE SINCE ITS INITIAL RELEASE IN 1966. PANNED WHEN IT OPENED IN THE U.S. QUICKLY REMOVED FROM CIRCULATION AND THEREAFTER TIED UP IN DISPUTES OVER OWNERSHIP IT HAS RARELY BEEN AVAILABLE ON TAPE OR DVD??UNLESS LIKE ME YOU WERE LUCKY ENOUGH TO OWN A PIRATED COPY. FOR ANY WELLES FAN IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A SORT OF HOLY GRAIL NOT LEAST BECAUSE IT WAS WELLES??S FAVORITE OF HIS FILMS THE ONE OF WHICH HE SAID ??IF I WANTED TO GET INTO HEAVEN ON THE BASIS OF ONE MOVIE THAT??S THE ONE I WOULD OFFER UP. I THINK IT??S BECAUSE IT IS TO ME THE LEAST FLAWED ?? I SUCCEEDED MORE COMPLETELY IN MY VIEW WITH THAT THAN WITH ANYTHING ELSE.? IF YOU WERE A WELLES FAN WOULDN??T YOU WANT TO SEE THAT MOVIE? NOW AFTER FOUR DECADES THE WAIT IS OVER. UNDER THE AUSPICES OF JANUS FILMS A NEWLY RESTORED VERSION OF THE FILM WELLES CONSIDERED HIS MASTERPIECE MADE FROM THE ORIGINAL 35 MM PRINT WILL BE RELEASED IN NEW YORK AND LOS ANGELES ON NEW YEAR??S DAY WITH OTHER DATES IN SELECT CITIES NATIONWIDE OVER THE COURSE OF THE WINTER AND SPRING. HAVING SEEN THE NEWLY MINTED VERSION I CAN??T SAY IF YOU??LL AGREE WITH WELLES??S VERDICT BUT IF YOU CARE ANYTHING ABOUT HIS MOVIES OR ABOUT SHAKESPEARE I DON??T THINK YOU WILL COME AWAY DISAPPOINTED. TO MAKE CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT WELLES COMBINED PASSAGES FROM SEVERAL SHAKESPEARE PLAYS BUT MOSTLY HENRY IV PARTS ONE AND TWO ELEVATING THE CHARACTER OF FALSTAFF FROM AN ENSEMBLE ROLE AND MAKING HIM THE MAIN ATTRACTION (WITH WELLES HIMSELF AS THE STAR). NO ONE TALKS MUCH ABOUT WELLES??S SKILL AS AN ADAPTOR BUT THE SEEMING EASE WITH WHICH HE SEAMLESSLY COMBINES AND CONDENSES SHAKESPEARE IS ONE OF THE TRUE MIRACLES OF THIS PRODUCTION. HE GIVES US JUST ENOUGH OF THE REST OF THE STORY TO MAKE IT ALL MAKE SENSE WITHOUT TAKING OUR EYES OFF THE CORPULENT MAIN ATTRACTION. THE RESULT IS A FILM AS NUANCED AS ANY WELLES EVER MADE ULTIMATELY A COMEDY AND A TRAGEDY IN EQUAL MEASURE WHICH IS NO MEAN FEAT. IT ALSO CONTAINS IN MY OPINION THE BEST BATTLE SCENE EVER FILMED. THE ROUGHLY TEN MINUTES DEVOTED TO THE BATTLE OF SHREWSBURY IS WAR FROM THE FOOT SOLDIER??S POINT OF VIEW??CHAOTIC VICIOUS AND UTTERLY CONFUSING ALBEIT EXTREMELY WELL EDITED: THE CONFUSION IS THE POINT: WARFARE TO WELLES WAS INDEED NASTY BRUTISH AND NOT NEARLY SHORT ENOUGH. THE SLAUGHTER THAT HE ETCHES ON THE SCREEN WILL HAUNT YOU FOR DAYS. ??HE HAS DIRECTED A SEQUENCE THE BATTLE OF SHREWSBURY? WROTE PAULINE KAEL IN THE NEW REPUBLIC IN 1967 ??WHICH IS UNLIKE ANYTHING HE HAS EVER DONE INDEED UNLIKE ANY BATTLE EVER DONE ON THE SCREEN BEFORE. IT RANKS WITH THE BEST OF GRIFFITH FORD EISENSTEIN KUROSAWA??THAT IS WITH THE BEST EVER DONE.? THE FIRST TIME I SAW THE FILM THAT BATTLE SCENE WAS THE THING THAT THRILLED ME MOST INSTANTLY. KAEL IS RIGHT: YOU??VE NEVER SEEN ITS LIKE. BUT ON SUBSEQUENT VIEWINGS I CAME TO REALIZE THAT THE BATTLE IS JUST THE CHERRY ON THE SUNDAE. WHAT DRAWS YOU BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN TO CHIMES OF MIDNIGHT IS THE COMPLICATED CHARACTER OF FALSTAFF HIMSELF A CHARACTER EMBRACED BY CRITICS FROM SAMUEL JOHNSON TO HAROLD BLOOM (WHO THOUGHT FALSTAFF AND HAMLET WERE SHAKESPEARE??S TWO GREATEST CREATIONS) AND THE CHARACTER THAT WELLES HIMSELF CALLED ??THE MOST DIFFICULT PART I EVER PLAYED IN MY LIFE.? I THINK I KNOW WHAT HE MEANT. SIR JOHN FALSTAFF IS A LIAR A THIEF A COWARD AND OBSEQUIOUS IN THE FACE OF POWER. HE IS ALSO A FAT GOATISH OLD DRUNK. AND YET HE IS ULTIMATELY A GOOD MAN. AND SO AS HE WOULD BE THE FIRST TO TELL YOU WE LOVE HIM AS PRINCE HAL HIS APPRENTICE IN SIN LOVES HIM. ??BANISH PLUMP JACK? FALSTAFF WARNS HAL ??AND BANISH ALL THE WORLD.? FLAWED AND SOMETIMES EVEN PITIABLE FALSTAFF DRAWS US IN BECAUSE HE IS FLAWED NEVER LESS THAN HUMAN OFTEN FUNNY (OFTEN AT HIS OWN EXPENSE) AND A TRULY JOYFUL MAN WHO EMBRACES FRIENDSHIP ABOVE ALL ELSE A TRAIT THAT IN SHAKESPEARE??S TELLING AND IN WELLES??S WILL PROVE HIS TRAGIC UNDOING. THERE IS ONE SHOT IN CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT A SHOT THAT SEEMS TO TAKE AN ETERNITY BUT WHICH CAN??T LAST AS MUCH AS HALF A MINUTE IN WHICH THE CAMERA GAZES UPON FALSTAFF??S MUTE FACE WHEN HAL NOW CROWNED HENRY V TELLS HIM ??I KNOW THEE NOT OLD MAN? AND BANISHES HIM. THE LOOK ON WELLES??S FACE IS NOT PURELY SAD OR EVEN SHOCKED. THOSE THINGS ARE THERE YES. BUT A HALF SMILE PLAYS ACROSS HIS FACE. THERE IS ALMOST SOMETHING ADMIRING IN HIS GAZE. IT IS A MIXTURE OF EMOTION THAT BLENDS CONFUSION REJECTION LOVE AND PATHOS ALL AT ONCE AND IN ITS STILLNESS AND COMPLEXITY IT IS ONE OF THE GREATEST PIECES OF ACTING I HAVE EVER SEEN. PEOPLE WE KNOW DO THINGS THAT IN THE MOMENT MAKE US SAY ??HOW LIKE IAGO? OR ??HOW LIKE MACBETH.? BUT MOST OF US WOULD ADMIT THAT WE DO NOT KNOW ANYONE COMPLETELY LIKE IAGO OR MACBETH OR VIOLA OR CORDELIA. BUT WITH FALSTAFF IT IS DIFFERENT. HE IS SUCH A MAN OF PARTS A MAN SO DELIGHTFULLY INFURIATINGLY HUMAN THAT WE CANNOT HELP BUT THINK HIM REAL. AND WE DO KNOW PEOPLE LIKE HIM PEOPLE WHO WE LOVE EVEN AS THEY DRIVE US MAD. NO WONDER HE WAS QUEEN ELIZABETH??S FAVORITE SHAKESPEARE CHARACTER SO MUCH SO THAT SHE ORDERED HIM TO WRITE A WHOLE PLAY AROUND FALSTAFF. (AND IF SHE??D GIVEN HIM MORE THAN A FORTNIGHT TO COMPLETE IT HE MIGHT HAVE DONE BETTER THAN THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR.) PUTTING THE FAT MAN IN THE SPOTLIGHT WELLES GIVES HIM HIS RIGHTFUL PLACE AT LAST IF NOT IN HIS OWN PLAY THEN AT LEAST IN HIS OWN MOVIE AND A GREAT ONE TOO. IF CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT WON??T GET YOU INTO HEAVEN WHO WOULD WANT TO GO THERE? ,19395.0
829,10062851.0,2016-01-19T05:01:00+00:00,AMMON BUNDY AND HIS GANG MUST GO TO JAIL,IF WE DON??T WANT TO SEE MORE GANGS OF ARMED MEN TAKE UP ARMS AGAINST THE UNITED STATES EVERY TIME THEY DISAGREE WITH FEDERAL GOVERNMENT POLICY THEN EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THE OREGON SIEGE MUST BE ARRESTED AND PROSECUTED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW. PERIOD. BUT SHOCKINGLY THERE ARE SIGNS THAT THESE MEN MAY GO FREE. THE LOCAL SHERIFF DAVID WARD JUST A FEW DAYS AGO MET WITH THEIR LEADER AMMON BUNDY AND OFFERED THEM ??SAFE PASSAGE? OUT OF THE STATE. BUNDY WHO HAS CALLED FOR A MEETING ON FRIDAY BETWEEN HIS MEN AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO DISCUSS THIS NOTED THAT THEY WILL LIKELY TAKE THE SHERIFF??S OFFER AND ??WE WILL GO OUT OF THIS STATE AND OUT OF THIS COUNTY AS FREE MEN.? FREE MEN?! WELL ACTUALLY I??M ALL FOR THESE MEN BEING FREE EVENTUALLY. BUT FIRST THEY DESERVE ??SAFE PASSAGE? FROM THE FEDERAL BUILDING THEY HAVE ILLEGALLY COMMANDEERED TO THE BACK OF POLICE CAR. FROM THERE THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN TO POLICE STATION WHERE THEY WILL BE FINGERPRINTED ETC. AND CHARGED WITH A STRING OF FEDERAL CRIMES. THEN THEY SHOULD BE ARRAIGNED BEFORE A JUDGE AND IF THEY CAN MAKE BAIL RELEASED UNTIL THEY HAVE THEIR DAY IN COURT. IF ALL GOES AS IT SEEMS IT SHOULD THEY WILL BE CONVICTED OF AT LEAST ONE FELONY BE REQUIRED UNDER FEDERAL LAW TO GIVE UP THEIR WEAPONS AND THEN SERVE TIME IN PRISON. AND ASSUMING THEY DON??T CAUSE MORE PROBLEMS WHILE IN FEDERAL PRISON THEY WILL THEN BE RELEASED AND FINALLY HAVE EARNED THE RIGHT TO BE ??FREE MEN.? BUT ONLY THEN SHOULD THEY BE FREE MEN. THESE ARMED MEN MUST BE CALLED TO ANSWER FOR THEIR CRIMES JUST LIKE ANY OTHER AMERICAN. THE MOST SERIOUS CHARGE THEY LIKELY FACE IS ??SEDITION.? UNDER FEDERAL LAW ??SEDITIOUS CONSPIRACY? IS DEFINED AS USING FORCE ??TO SEIZE TAKE OR POSSESS ANY PROPERTY OF THE UNITED STATES CONTRARY TO THE AUTHORITY.? THE BUNDY GANG ILLEGALLY TAKING CONTROL OF FEDERAL PROPERTY BECAUSE THEY WANT TO COERCE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CHANGE ITS POLICIES IS THE VERY DEFINITION OF SEDITION. THIS CRIME CARRIES WITH IT A PRISON TERM OF UP TO 20 YEARS. THEY ALSO INTENTIONAL DESTROYED FEDERAL PROPERTY A FEW DAYS AGO NAMELY A FENCE THAT WAS ERECTED TO PREVENT LOCAL FAMERS FROM ALLOWING THEIR CATTLE TO GRAZE ON FEDERAL PROPERTY. THIS FENCE WAS BUILT BY THE U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE USING A $100000 GRANT. DESTRUCTION OF FEDERAL PROPERTY THAT EXCEEDS $1000 IN VALUE IS PUNISHABLE BY A FINE AND IMPRISONMENT OF UP TO 10 YEARS. AND THE LIST OF CRIMES GOES ON FROM THERE FROM TRESPASSING TO UNAUTHORIZED USE OF GOVERNMENT PROPERTY (THEY USED A GOVERNMENT COMPUTER TO BUILD A WEBSITE AND UTILIZED GOVERNMENT VEHICLES.) THEY ALSO MAY BE CHARGED FOR VIOLATING OREGON STATE LAW. IN ADDITION TO JAIL TIME THESE MEN SHOULD BE ORDERED TO REIMBURSE THE GOVERNMENT FOR THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR CRIMES. AN OREGON JUDGE NOTED THAT THE COUNTY??S SECURITY COSTS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS SIEGE ARE $70000 PER DAY. DESPITE WHAT SOME ON THE RIGHT ARGUE THESE ARMED ANTI-GOVERNMENT PROTESTERS ARE NOT JUST LIKE THE OCCUPY WALL STREET PROTESTERS. BUT IF YOU DO WANT TO COMPARE THEM THEN KEEP IN MIND THAT NEARLY 8000 OCCUPY PROTESTERS WERE ARRESTED. AND WHILE THE CRIMINAL CHARGES WERE LATER DISMISSED AGAINST MANY SOME HAD TO ENDURE A FULL TRIAL AND EVEN JAIL TIME. IN ADDITION OCCUPY PROTESTERS WERE FORCIBLY DRAGGED OFF SIDEWALKS BY THE POLICE AND INFAMOUSLY ONE GROUP OF PROTESTERS HAD MACE SPRAYED IN THEIR FACES WHILE DOING NOTHING MORE THAN SITTING ON THE SIDEWALK. WHAT A CONTRAST TO WHAT WE ARE SEEING NOW WITH THE BUNDY INSURGENTS. THESE MEN ARE DESTROYING FEDERAL PROPERTY IN FULL PUBLIC VIEW AND THE POLICE SIMPLY SIT IDLY BY. (AND I HARDLY EVEN NEED TO NOTE HOW MUCH DIFFERENTLY THE AUTHORITIES WOULD TREAT THE ARMED MEN IF THEY WERE BLACK OR MUSLIM.) JUSTICE DEMANDS THAT THESE MEN GO TO JAIL. AFTER ALL SISTER KATHLEEN DESAUTELS WAS SENTENCED TO SIX MONTHS IN JAIL FOR TRESPASSING ON A U.S. MILITARY BASE FOR A MATTER OF MINUTES IN CONNECTION WITH A PROTEST OPPOSING U.S. MILITARY POLICY. DESAUTELS AND OTHERS SIMPLY WENT AROUND THE FENCE SURROUNDING THE MILITARY BASE AND WERE THEN IMMEDIATELY ARRESTED BY POLICE WAITING ON THE OTHER SIDE. SHOULD AN UNARMED NUN WHO SNUCK UNTO A MILITARY BASE AND WAS QUICKLY ARRESTED WITHOUT INCIDENT GET MORE JAIL TIME THAN AN ARMED GROUP OF MEN WHO HAVE ILLEGALLY TAKEN CONTROL OF A FEDERAL BUILDING FOR WEEKS INTENTIONALLY DESTROYED FEDERAL PROPERTY AND VOWED THAT THEY WILL KILL PEOPLE IF THEY ARE ATTACKED? SHERIFF WARD SHOULD BE COMMENDED FOR WANTING TO END THIS STAND-OFF PEACEFULLY. AND HIS OFFER OF SAFE PASSAGE DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN NO CRIMINAL CHARGES WILL BE FILED DESPITE HOW BUNDY VIEWS IT. ALTHOUGH EVEN SAFE PASSAGE ALONE IS A GENEROUS OFFER GIVEN THAT NOT ONLY HAS WARD BEEN SUBJECT TO DEATH THREATS BY BUNDY SUPPORTERS HIS WIFE HAD TO LEAVE TOWN FOR HER OWN SAFETY AFTER HER TIRES WERE SLASHED AND SHE WAS FOLLOWED BY STRANGERS. AND EVEN MORE DISTURBING THE SHERIFF??S ELDERLY PARENTS HAVE BEEN HARASSED BY BUNDY SUPPORTERS. AS A NATION WE CANNOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE AS LAST YEAR WHEN THE ARMED STAND-OFF AT THE BUNDY RANCH IN NEVADA ENDED WITH NO ARRESTS. IF THAT HAPPENS HERE EXPECT EVEN MORE OF THESE TYPES OF ARMED STAND-OFFS AND POSSIBLY EVEN INNOCENT AMERICANS BEING KILLED. BUNDY AND HIS MEN ARE NOT ABOVE THE LAW SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY CLAIM THEY ARE ON A MISSION FROM GOD. JUST LIKE ISIS MILITANTS ARE NOT ABOVE THE LAW BY MAKING THE IDENTICAL CLAIM. ,63771.0

ORGANIZERS ORIGINALLY BILLED THE 1980S HITMAKERS AS ENTERTAINMENT FOR A PARTY DURING THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION HONORING PROMINENT REPUBLICAN POLITICIANS??AND LIKELY AWASH IN LOBBYISTS AND CORPORATE INFLUENCE PEDDLERS. BUT CARLA EUDY A PROMINENT GOP FUNDRAISER WHOSE PAST CONVENTION PARTIES HAVE BEEN?ŸSPONSORED BY THE LIKES OF KOCH INDUSTRIES AND MEGADONOR SHELDON ADELSON??S LAS VEGAS SANDS CORP. SAID KOOL & THE GANG WAS NO LONGER PARTICIPATING. EUDY DECLINED TO EXPLAIN WHY THE BAND NOW WON??T BE PERFORMING AT THE EVENT SCHEDULED FOR JULY 17 IN CLEVELAND. ??THE REASONS ARE BETWEEN US AND THE BAND AND WE AGREED NOT TO DISCUSS THE TERMS? SHE SAID IN AN E-MAIL. KOOL & THE GANG??S MANAGEMENT COMPANY RED LIGHT MANAGEMENT DID NOT RESPOND TO A REQUEST FOR COMMENT. A SOLICITATION SENT TO PROSPECTIVE SPONSORS STATES THE PARTY IS MEANT TO HONOR REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP AND MEMBERS OF THE U.S. SENATE WITH NATIONAL REPUBLICAN SENATORIAL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN ROGER WICKER A U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSISSIPPI AS THE FEATURED SPEAKER. THE BRIGHT SIDE FOR THE ORGANIZERS WHO HAVE A LONG TRACK RECORD OF ORGANIZING THESE PARTIES: THEY??RE UNLIKELY TO HAVE MUCH TROUBLE FINDING AN ACT TO TAKE KOOL & THE GANG??S PLACE. KID ROCK JOURNEY LYNYRD SKYNYRD AND THE COMMODORES HAVE PLAYED REPUBLICAN CONVENTION-ASSOCIATED EVENTS IN PAST YEARS. DEMOCRATS HAVE?ŸROCKED OUT TO KANYE WEST THE BLACK EYED PEAS AND DEATH CAB FOR CUTIE. BUT CLEARLY IT??S TIME TO GET DOWN ON IT. THAT??S BECAUSE REGARDLESS OF WHICH PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES WIN THEIR PARTIES?? NOMINATIONS PARTISAN OPERATIVES VIEW NATIONAL CONVENTIONS AS PRIME POWER NETWORKING OPPORTUNITIES. LAVISH CORPORATE-AND-LOBBYIST-SPONSORED EVENTS THAT HAPPEN ALONGSIDE THE CONVENTIONS ARE CLASSIC VENUES FOR POLITICOS AND POLITICAL INFLUENCERS TO CONNECT. CONGRESS PASSED SWEEPING ETHICS REFORM LEGISLATION IN 2007 THAT IN PART ATTEMPTED TO CURB THE CONVENTION-RELATED MINGLING BETWEEN LAWMAKERS AND THE CORPORATIONS AND LOBBYISTS THAT ADVOCATE BEFORE THEM. STILL THERE ARE MULTIPLE LOOPHOLES THAT HAVE ALLOWED THE PARTIES TO CONTINUE. BECAUSE OF THEM CONVENTION ATTENDEES ESPECIALLY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS CONTINUE TO HAVE THEIR PICK OF FANCY FUNCTIONS CAREFULLY TAILORED TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW. FOR EXAMPLE SOME RULES APPLY SPECIFICALLY TO EVENTS HELD DURING THE DATES OF THE CONVENTION. THE JULY 17 AFFAIR COMES ONE DAY BEFORE THE KICKOFF OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION. ??SIMPLY BY STAGING THIS PARTY PRIOR TO THE OFFICIAL DATE OF THE CONVENTION THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD THE PRICE OF ADMISSION WILL NO DOUBT BE DULY RECOGNIZED AND GIVEN ONE-ON-ONE FACE TIME WITH THE SENATORS AND PARTY OFFICIALS? SAID CRAIG HOLMAN GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS LOBBYIST FOR THE NONPROFIT ADVOCACY GROUP PUBLIC CITIZEN AFTER SEEING A FLIER ADVERTISING SPONSORSHIP PACKAGES FOR THE JULY 17 PARTY. IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE CENTER FOR PUBLIC INTEGRITY EUDY SAID THE POINT OF THE DATE OUTSIDE OF THE CONVENTION PERIOD WASN??T EVADING ETHICS RULES THAT APPLY SPECIFICALLY TO EVENTS HELD WITHIN THE DATES OF THE CONVENTION. RATHER IT WAS BECAUSE THERE??S LESS COMPETITION FROM OTHER PARTIES FOR VENUES AND ATTENDEES SHE SAID. NONETHELESS ??THE PARTY CONVENTIONS ARE THE MOST TROUBLING BIG MONEY BONANZAS ON THE ELECTION CALENDAR RIFE WITH OPPORTUNITIES FOR SPECIAL INTERESTS TO BUY FACE TIME WITH OUR NATION??S ELECTED LEADERS AND THEIR STAFF? SAID PAUL S. RYAN DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE NONPARTISAN CAMPAIGN LEGAL CENTER. THE LOWEST-TIER SPONSORSHIP OPTION FOR THE PARTY??THE $25000 ??HURON? PACKAGE??INCLUDES 10 TICKETS TO A VIP AREA 10 GENERAL ADMISSION TICKETS AND CORPORATE NAME AND LOGO PLACEMENT ON INVITATIONS CREDENTIALS AND EVENT SIGNAGE. THEN THERE??S THE $100000 ??SUPERIOR? PACKAGE FOR THE MAIN EVENT UNDERWRITER WHICH INCLUDES MORE TICKETS A ROPED-OFF AREA WITHIN THE VIP SECTION PROMINENT CORPORATE LOGO PLACEMENT AND A BACKSTAGE PHOTO OP WITH THE BAND FOR UP TO SIX COUPLES. OTHER PAST CLIENTS AND EVENT SPONSORS FOR EVENTS PUT TOGETHER BY EUDY??S TEAM INCLUDE TRADE ASSOCIATION AMERICA??S HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS GOOGLE EXXONMOBIL AND A LONG LIST OF OTHER WELL-KNOWN COMPANIES AND TRADE ASSOCIATIONS. SO FAR MOST LOBBYING FIRMS AND COMPANIES ARE KEEPING THEIR NATIONAL CONVENTION PLANS QUIET. FOR EXAMPLE PROMINENT DEMOCRATIC LOBBYIST TONY PODESTA DID CONFIRM HIS FIRM THE PODESTA GROUP WILL HOST EVENTS AT BOTH CONVENTIONS. REPUBLICAN LOBBYING FIRM BGR GROUP HEADED BY FORMER REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN AND MISSISSIPPI GOV. HALEY BARBOUR CONFIRMED IT WILL BE HOSTING A PARTY BUT DECLINED TO RELEASE DETAILS. THERE??S SOME EVIDENCE HOWEVER THAT HIGH-PROFILE VENUES IN BOTH CITIES ARE BOOKING UP. FOR INSTANCE JENNY PACKER A SPOKESWOMAN FOR THE?ŸNATIONAL CONSTITUTION CENTER IN PHILADELPHIA SAID THE MUSEUM WHICH IS DEDICATED TO INCREASING AWARENESS OF THE CONSTITUTION HAS HAD MULTIPLE QUERIES FOR DATES DURING OR AROUND THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION AND ALREADY HAS SEVERAL NIGHTS ON HOLD. ??I EXPECT THAT WE WILL DEFINITELY BE BOOKED EVERY SINGLE EVENING OF THE CONVENTION? SHE SAID. THE CONSTITUTION CENTER??S VENUE OPTIONS RANGE FROM THE GRAND HALL OVERLOOK WHICH BOASTS A VIEW OF INDEPENDENCE MALL AND CAN ACCOMMODATE A COCKTAIL RECEPTION FOR 800 PEOPLE AND RENTS FOR ABOUT $5000 TO THE KIRBY AUDITORIUM WHICH SEATS 200 PEOPLE AND GOES FOR ABOUT $1500 FOR THE NIGHT.

NORMALLY SUCH A RABID RUSH TO PIN A CRISIS ON OBAMA COULD BE SHRUGGED OFF AS PARTISANSHIP BUT IN THIS CASE. NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION EXPERTS AGREE: OBAMA THEY CLAIM IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FAILURE OF AMERICA TO PREVENT NORTH KOREA FROM EXPANDING ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM. AMERICA'S STRATEGY ON NORTH KOREA IN THE FIRST YEARS OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WAS LED BY THE WHITE HOUSE AND NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION CONCEPT OF 'STRATEGIC PATIENCE' EMERGED EARLY ON IN THE ADMINISTRATION AFTER THE SCATHING EXPERIENCE OF NORTH KOREA??S 2009 NUCLEAR TEST. THE STRATEGY ESSENTIALLY DEMANDED THAT NORTH KOREANS RECOMMIT TO CONCRETE STEPS TOWARDS DENUCLEARIZATION??SUCH AS ALLOWING INSPECTORS AND FREEZING FISSILE MATERIAL PRODUCTION??AS A PRECONDITION OF ANY FUTURE TALKS.?Ÿ \IT MEANT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION DIDN??T WANT TO BE DRIVEN BY A DPRK-ORCHESTRATED SENSE OF CRISIS AND WOULD RESPOND IN ITS OWN TIME TO NORTH KOREAN INITIATIVES\"" SAID SCOTT SYNDER A SENIOR FELLOW AT THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS. \""THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION CAME INTO OFFICE WITH A HEALTHY SKEPTICISM OF NORTH KOREA'S ABILITY TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON ITS COMMITMENTS.? EXPLAINS DARYL KIMBALL PUBLISHER OF ARMS CONTROL TODAY.

WE ARE PROUD TO ENDORSE HILLARY CLINTON FOR PRESIDENT AND BELIEVE THAT SHE IS THE CHAMPION WE CAN COUNT ON IN NOVEMBER??AND EVERY DAY SHE OCCUPIES THE OVAL OFFICE.? ACCORDING TO NATIONAL POLL NUMBER AVERAGES FROM REAL CLEAR POLITICS THE ENDORSEMENT WAS A SAFE BET. ALTHOUGH SHE APPEARS TO BE LOSING MOMENTUM CLINTON IS STILL BEATING HER DEMOCRATIC OPPONENTS??LEADING HER CLOSEST RIVAL SEN. BERNIE SANDERS BY 13 POINTS. SHE REMAINS THE FRONTRUNNER BUOYED BY HER STATUS AS THE MAINSTREAM ALTERNATIVE TO SANDERS?? FAR-LEFT VIEWS. AND IN A STATEMENT SANDERS ARGUED THAT THE HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN ENDORSEMENT WHILE A FRUSTRATING CHOICE GIVEN HIS RECORD ON LGBT RIGHTS IS AN INDICATOR OF HER STATUS AS THE ??ESTABLISHMENT? PICK. ??WHAT WE ARE DOING IN THIS CAMPAIGN IT JUST BLOWS MY MIND EVERY DAY BECAUSE I SEE IT CLEARLY WE??RE TAKING ON NOT ONLY WALL STREET AND ECONOMIC ESTABLISHMENT WE??RE TAKING ON THE POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT? SANDERS SAID. ??SOME OF THESE GROUPS ARE IN FACT A PART OF THE ESTABLISHMENT.? THE STATEMENT MAY HAVE PROVEN CONTROVERSIAL ON THE INTERNET BUT BERNIE SANDERS IS BOTH ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND COMPLETELY MISSING THE POINT. THE HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN HAS LONG BEEN CRITICIZED BY QUEER ACTIVISTS AS THE EMBODIMENT OF ??BIG GAY? POLITICS MARGINALIZING THE INTERESTS OF TRANS FOLKS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR IN FAVOR OF ISSUES THAT FAVOR RICH WHITE GAY MEN. BUT IN DISTANCING HIMSELF FROM THE POLITICS OF THE MRS. CLINTON AND THE ??ESTABLISHMENT? THAT SUPPORTS HER HE FAILS TO RECOGNIZE THAT HIS OWN HISTORY ON THE ISSUES IS HARDLY RADICAL. WHILE THE HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN PUSHED THE ISSUES OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY AND GAYS SERVING OPENLY IN THE MILITARY THROUGHOUT THE 1990S AND 2000S THE ORGANIZATION PERSISTENTLY FOUGHT THE INCLUSION OF TRANS PEOPLE IN EQUAL RIGHTS LEGISLATION. THE HRC FAMOUSLY OPPOSED GENDER IDENTITY PROTECTIONS IN THE EMPLOYMENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT. FIRST INTRODUCED TO CONGRESS BY SEN. GERRY STUDDS (D-MASS.) BACK IN 1994 THE BILL SOUGHT TO PROHIBIT IDENTITY-BASED WORKPLACE DISCRIMINATION??MEANING THAT EMPLOYERS WOULD NO LONGER BE ABLE TO FIRE SOMEONE (OR PREVENT THEM FROM BEING HIRED) ON THE BASIS OF THEIR LGBT STATUS. BUT THE HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN??S THEN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR ELIZABETH BIRCH OPPOSED OFFERING THOSE PROTECTIONS TO TRANSGENDER WORKERS STATING IT WOULD HAPPEN ??OVER HER DEAD BODY.? AS TRANSGRIOT??S MONICA ROBERTS EXPLAINS BIRCH??S OPPOSITION WAS BASED ON AN OLD TACTIC OF GAY RIGHTS LEADERS: BY THROWING TRANS PEOPLE UNDER THE BUS THEY HOPED TO MAKE BILLS LIKE ENDA MORE PALATABLE TO THE MAINSTREAM??IN CUTTING OUT SUCH ??EXTREME LANGUAGE.? THE GAY LIBERATION FRONT??S JIM FOURATT USED THE SAME EXACT ARGUMENT TO OPPOSE TRANS INCLUSION IN A 1971 ANTI-DISCRIMINATION MEASURE. WHILE CHAD GRIFFIN THE CURRENT PRESIDENT OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN HAS PUBLICLY APOLOGIZED TO THE COMMUNITY FOR THE ORGANIZATION??S HISTORICALLY BAD RECORD ON TRANS RIGHTS THE HRC HAS STILL STRUGGLED TO OVERCOME ITS OWN LEGACY OF DISCRIMINATION. DURING A 2012 RALLY IN SUPPORT OF SAME-SEX MARRIAGE THE GROUP ASKED ATTENDEES NOT TO DISPLAY A FLAG REPRESENTING THE TRANS COMMUNITY. ACCORDING TO MIC??S MARIBEL HERMOSILLO HRC WORKERS TOLD THEM THAT ??MARRIAGE EQUALITY ISN??T A TRANS ISSUE.? IN ADDITION TO SIDELINING TRANS VOICES IN FAVOR OF APPEALING TO THE MAINSTREAM THE HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN??S WORKPLACE EQUALITY INDEX HAS LONG SUPPORTED COMPANIES THAT WORK AGAINST QUEER INTERESTS. 2015 MARKED THE 12TH YEAR IN A ROW THAT THE HRC AWARDED GOLDMAN SACHS??THE WALL STREET FIRM WHOSE SUBPRIME MORTGAGE PRACTICES WERE INSTRUMENTAL IN CRASHING THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IN 2008??WITH A PERFECT RATING. AS QUEER PEOPLE (ESPECIALLY TRANS FOLKS) ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY LIKELY TO LIVE UNDER THE POVERTY LINE THESE MARGINALIZED GROUPS ARE UNIQUELY AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC CRISES. ASIDE FROM SIMILAR ACRONYMS HILLARY CLINTON HAS MUCH IN COMMON WITH THE HRC. KNOWN AS ??MRS. WALL STREET? SHE??S VIEWED BY INSIDERS AS THE CANDIDATE MOST FAVORABLE TO CORPORATE INTERESTS. THIS STANDS IN STARK CONTRAST TO SANDERS WHO HAS DEDICATED HIS CAREER TO TAKING ON THE EXCESSES OF UNREGULATED CAPITALISM. ??LET US WAGE A MORAL AND POLITICAL WAR AGAINST THE BILLIONAIRES AND CORPORATE LEADERS ON WALL STREET AND ELSEWHERE WHOSE POLICIES AND GREED ARE DESTROYING THE MIDDLE CLASS OF AMERICA? SANDERS URGED IN A 2012 ESSAY FOR THE HUFFINGTON POST. IF THOSE LEANINGS PUT CLINTON AT ODDS WITH THE ECONOMIC INTERESTS OF MANY LGBT PEOPLE HER QUEER ADVOCACY HAS ALSO BEEN THE PRODUCT OF ESTABLISHMENT THINKING. DURING THE 1990S HILLARY CLINTON SUPPORTED BOTH DON??T ASK DON??T TELL AND THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT A PAIR OF BILLS THAT RESPECTIVELY BARRED GAYS FROM MILITARY SERVICE AND RESTRICTED THE LEGAL DEFINITION OF ??MARRIAGE? TO THE UNION BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN. BOTH POLICIES??WHICH WERE WILDLY POPULAR AT THE TIME??WERE INSTITUTED DURING HER HUSBAND??S TENURE AS PRESIDENT. DURING HER SUCCESSFUL NEW YORK SENATE RUN IN 2000 CLINTON CONTINUED TO BACK DOMA??ALTHOUGH SHE WOULD DISTANCE HERSELF FROM THE BILL DURING HER 2008 CAMPAIGN FOR THE WHITE HOUSE. THIS WAS A TIME WHEN MOST AMERICANS STILL OPPOSED FULL LEGAL RECOGNITION FOR SAME-SEX COUPLES BUT AS PUBLIC OPINION SHIFTED SO DID HILLARY CLINTON??S OPINIONS ON THE SUBJECT. MAY 2012 MARKED THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY A MAJORITY OF U.S. CITIZENS (AT 50 PERCENT) SUPPORTED MARRIAGE EQUALITY AND JUST 10 MONTHS LATER CLINTON WOULD ANNOUNCE SHE TOO HAD ??EVOLVED? ON THE ISSUE. SHE FINALLY CAME OUT IN SUPPORT OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY IN 2013. IN CONTRAST WITH CLINTON??S ??WAIT AND SEE? APPROACH SANDERS HAS TOUTED HIMSELF AS AHEAD OF THE CURVE ON QUEER EQUALITY. LAST MAY SANDERS EXPLAINED TO THE NEW YORK TIMES THAT HE DIDN??T HAVE TO ??COME AROUND? TO THE ISSUE. ??I??M NOT EVOLVING WHEN IT COMES TO GAY RIGHTS? HE SAID. ??I WAS THERE!? LEANING ON HIS TRACK RECORD IS A FAMILIAR ARGUMENT FOR THE VERMONT SENATOR WHO ALSO TOUTS HIS HISTORY ON CIVIL RIGHTS AS PROOF THAT HE STANDS WITH THE GOALS OF THE #BLACKLIVESMATTER CAMPAIGN. BUT WHETHER HE LIKES IT OR NOT HE??S BEEN JUST AS MUCH A PARTICIPANT IN ??ESTABLISHMENT? POLITICS AS THE GROUPS THAT HE??S CRITICIZING. SANDERS VOICED SUPPORT FOR GAY RIGHTS IN AN EARLY-1970S OPEN LETTER AND OPPOSED DOMA AND WHILE HE WAS AHEAD OF HIS TIME ON BOTH COUNTS NEITHER OF THESE STANCES SHOWED AN EXPLICIT CONCERN FOR LGBT PEOPLE. INSTEAD HIS APPEALS WERE BASED ON GOVERNMENT OVERREACH AND CONSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS. ??[T]HERE ARE ENTIRELY TOO MANY LAWS THAT REGULATE HUMAN BEHAVIOR? HE WROTE IN THE LETTER. ??LET US ABOLISH ALL LAWS WHICH ATTEMPT TO IMPOSE A PARTICULAR BRAND OF MORALITY OR ??RIGHT?? ON PEOPLE.? IN RESPONSE TO SANDERS?? ??NO? VOTE AGAINST THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT HIS WIFE JANE SANDERS SPECIFIED THAT IT WAS NOT AN IDENTITY-BASED DECISION. INSTEAD HER HUSBAND FELT THAT IT CONSTITUTED A VIOLATION OF THE LEGAL JURISDICTION GRANTED TO INDIVIDUAL STATES TO DECIDE MARRIAGE LAWS. ??WE??RE NOT LEGISLATING VALUES? MRS. SANDERS ARGUED. ??WE HAVE TO FOLLOW THE CONSTITUTION.? ACCORDING TO THE HUFFINGTON POST ??[BERNIE SANDERS??] SPOKESMAN MICHAEL BRIGGS MADE THE CASE?? THAT SANDERS HAS BEEN WAY AHEAD OF CLINTON??AND PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE??IN ADVOCATING SAME-SEX MARRIAGE.? BUT THAT??S SIMPLY NOT TRUE. IN AN ESSAY FOR SLATE MARK JOSEPH STERN WRITES ??AS MAYOR OF BURLINGTON IN 1990 SANDERS TOLD AN INTERVIEWER THAT LGBT RIGHTS WERE NOT A ??MAJOR PRIORITY?? FOR HIM.? HE OPPOSED MARRIAGE EQUALITY THROUGHOUT THE 2000S CALLING IT A ??DIVISIVE? ISSUE AND MAINTAINING HIS SUPPORT FOR CIVIL UNIONS BEFORE EVENTUALLY COMING AROUND IN 2009. AND ALTHOUGH VERMONT WOULD BECOME THE FIRST STATE TO PASS CIVIL UNIONS IN 2000 HIS SUPPORT FOR THAT GROUNDBREAKING MEASURE WASN??T ABOUT MAKING HISTORY FOR SAME-SEX COUPLES BUT BASED IN THE EXACT SAME MINDSET: PROTECTING STATES?? RIGHTS. SANDERS FINALLY ??EVOLVED? ON MARRIAGE FOUR YEARS BEFORE HILLARY CLINTON??THE LENGTH OF AN ENTIRE PRESIDENTIAL TERM??BUT IT??S HARDLY THE LIGHTYEARS-AHEAD-OF-ITS-TIME STANCE HIS CAMPAIGN IS TOUTING. WHETHER OR NOT HE LIKES TO ADMIT IT THAT MEANS THE PROGRESSIVE SENATOR HAS MORE IN COMMON WITH CLINTON AND THE HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN THAN HE??D LIKE TO BELIEVE.

A TWITTER EXCHANGE BETWEEN AMY SCHUMER AND A RELATIVELY UNKNOWN 17-YEAR-OLD FILM CRITIC JACKSON MURPHY HAS CRITICS TAKING UP ARMS OR MORE ACCURATELY THEIR SMARTPHONES. AFTER TAKING A PHOTO WITH SCHUMER AT THE CRITICS CHOICE AWARDS ON SUNDAY MURPHY (TWEETING UNDER THE TINNY USERNAME @LIGHTSCAMERAJACKSON) SHARED THE IMAGE WITH THE CAPTION ??SPENT THE NIGHT WITH @AMYSCHUMER. CERTAINLY NOT THE FIRST GUY TO WRITE THAT.? MURPHY HAS SINCE DELETED THE TWEET BUT SCHUMER RESPONDED SWIFTLY OVER TWITTER: ??I GET IT. CAUSE I'M A WHORE? GLAD I TOOK A PHOTO WITH YOU. HI TO YOUR DAD.? MURPHY WAS FAST CALLED OUT BY MULTIPLE OUTLETS FOR HIS ??SEXIST? ??MISGOYNISTIC? TWEET AND THE MISGUIDED CHUTZPAH TO CONSIDER ??SLUT-SHAMING? THE CAN-DO-NO-WRONG SCHUMER. BUT THAT??S THE THING--THIS BACKLASH AGAINST MURPHY APPEARS TO HAVE SWUNG THE PUBLIC OPINION PENDULUM AGAINST SEEMINGLY TEFLON SCHUMER AT LEAST IN SOME CIRCLES. TO SOME (INCLUDING THIS WRITER) SCHUMER??S INITIAL TWEET SEEMED A BIT HYPOCRITICAL AND HEAVY-HANDED. WHILE SCHUMER DIDN??T PERSONALLY TELL COSMOPOLITAN OR PEREZ HILTON TO TURN THE SCREWS ON MURPHY BY CALLING HIM ON TWITTER SHE GAVE THEM THE GO-AHEAD TO RUN WITH IT. THE PROCEEDING MEDIA TAKEDOWN FOR AN UNFUNNY TWEET--BUT ONE THAT THIS FEMINIST WOULD BE LOATHE TO CALL SEXIST OR A FORM OF SLUT-SHAMING ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT WAS AN (ALBEIT WEAK) ATTEMPT TO TAG ALONG ON A JOKE SCHUMER REGULARLY MAKES ABOUT HERSELF--RUBBED PEOPLE THE WRONG WAY. LESS NOTICED IS THE FACT THAT MURPHY ELOQUENTLY AND MATURELY OFFERED A FULL APOLOGY. IN TURN SCHUMER TWEETED ??THAT'S REALLY OKAY HONEY. I JUST REMEMBER THINKING YOU AND YOUR DAD WERE SWEET AND IT WAS A BUMMER TO READ THAT.? IN ANOTHER WORLD PERHAPS ONE IN WHICH THE MEDIA WEREN??T AS OBSESSED WITH PLACING CERTAIN CELEBRITIES ON THE COVETED SACROSANCT POSITION OF IMAGINED BFF AND IN WHICH SCHUMER (AND HER HANDLERS) HADN??T HAPPILY ACCEPTED THIS POSITION AND IMAGE OF HER AS A BRASSY SINCERE DOWN-TO-EARTH GROSS SEXY ALL-AROUND PERFECT GAL THIS LITTLE FLARE-UP WOULD BE ALL SAID AND DONE. BUT THAT??S NOT THE CASE. WE??RE LEFT WITH A BAD TASTE IN OUR MOUTH AND BEGINNING TO QUESTION THAT UNDYING LOVE FOR SCHUMER THE HOLLYWOOD HEROINE OF OUR DREAMS WHO GAVE A SPEECH FAR MORE EMPOWERING ARTICULATE AND AUTHENTIC THAN WE??D COME TO EXPECT FROM CELEBRITIES AT 2015??S GLAMOUR AWARDS AND POSED NAKED IN THE MOST CHARMINGLY PERFECT SEXY ENCOURAGING SELF-DEPRECATING WAY FATHOMABLE. YET SUDDENLY AFTER HER UNNECESSARILY OVER-CRITICAL RESPONSE TO A TEENAGER??S BOTCHED JOKE SCHUMER FINDS HERSELF IN GOOD COMPANY WITH HER CELEBRITY SISTER-IN-ARMS JENNIFER LAWRENCE??ALSO TILL RECENTLY PERCEIVED AS INTELLIGENT FUNNY SEXY IMPLAUSIBLY GRACEFUL AND FUN????REAL.?? AFTER WINNING BEST ACTRESS IN A COMEDY OR MUSICAL AT THE GOLDEN GLOBES EARLIER THIS MONTH LAWRENCE CALLED OUT A REPORTER WHO WAS ON HIS PHONE DURING THE PRESS CONFERENCE. HE APPEARED TO BE READING NOTES AND SOME REPORTERS NOTED THAT ENGLISH MAY NOT HAVE BEEN HIS NATIVE LANGUAGE. LAWRENCE WAGGED HER FINGER AT HIM AND MOCKED HIM. \WE'RE AT THE GOLDEN GLOBES. IF YOU PUT YOUR PHONE DOWN YOU'D KNOW THAT? LAWRENCE SAID. MANY THOUGHT LAWRENCE WAS JUST JOKING. ANNE HATHAWAY RUSHED TO HER DEFENSE CLAIMING THE REMARKS WERE TAKEN ??OUT OF CONTEXT? (AND AS THE SUBJECT OF THE MYSTERIOUS HATHA-HATE ANNE HATHAWAY MAY KNOW WHAT SHE SPEAKS OF). YES LAWRENCE CAME OFF AS OBNOXIOUS AND DISTASTEFUL BUT NO LESS SO THAN SEAN PENN??S SELF-AGGRANDIZING EL CHAPO PROFILE. THE LAWRENCE AND SCHUMER PROBLEM IS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN SOLD TO THE AUDIENCE AS RELATABLE ??REGULAR?? WOMEN. AND SO WHEN THEIR HOLLYWOOD STEEL OR ENTITLEMENT SHOWS ITSELF IT FEELS JARRING. YET THESE MOMENTS RIGHTLY REMIND US OF THE REALITY AND SCALE OF SCHUMER AND LAWRENCE??S SUCCESS. WE SHOULDN??T BELIEVE THE HYPE NO MATTER HOW ATTRACTIVELY IT PLAYS IN THE MEDIA AND NO MATTER HOW GENUINELY THE WOMEN THEMSELVES WEAR THEIR DOWN-TO-EARTHNESS. LAWRENCE REGALED US WITH STORIES ABOUT HOW SHE TOO HATED GOING OUT FOR NEW YEAR??S AND INEVITABLY ENDS UP ??DRUNK AND DISAPPOINTED? AS WE ALL DO. SHE FAILED TO MENTION THAT SHE WOULD BE ??DRUNK AND DISAPPOINTED? AT CHATEAU MARMONT MAKING OUT WITH LIAM HEMSWORTH. THE MEDIA (INCLUDING ME) FELL IN LOVE WITH LAWRENCE AND SCHUMER FOR CUTTING LOOSE AND DANCING ON PIANOS. WE DIDN??T DWELL ON THE FACT THE PIANO WAS ON THE STAGE OF A BILLY JOEL CONCERT AND THAT THE LEGENDARY SINGER PERSONALLY INVITED THE CELEBRITIES TO BOOGIE DOWN. AND NOW THAT LAWRENCE AND SCHUMER ARE SEEMING NOT SO NONCHALANT ABOUT FAME BUT RATHER A LITTLE DIVA-ESQUE IN LAWRENCE??S CASE OR THIN-SKINNED FOR A COMEDIAN WHO BUILT A REP ON DOLING IT OUT IN SCHUMER??S WE ARE DISCOMFITED BY THE REVELATION OF THE WOMEN??S MORE IMPERIOUS SELVES. IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF CELEBRITY BEHAVIOR THAT HAS BEEN FORGIVEN LAWRENCE??S JERKY REBUFF TO THE REPORTER AND SCHUMER??S SORTA TAKEDOWN OF AN UNFUNNY TEENAGE BOY WERE PRETTY MINOR. THEY HAVE ATTRACTED COMMENT BECAUSE THE WOMEN DON??T SEEM TO BE NAOMI CAMPBELL-ESQUE CELL-PHONE THROWING DIVAS OR SHOUTILY INTIMIDATING LIKE CHRISTIAN BALE. IT IS FOR US PERHAPS TO GROW UP??NOT THEM. THEY AND THEIR MANAGEMENT MAY BE COMPLICIT OR PRO-ACTIVE IN THE CRAFTING OF THEIR IMAGES BUT THE GLOWING DEIFICATION OF THEM IS ALSO THE PROVINCE OF AN OVERLY-ADORING MEDIA. IN OUR AGE OF EVERYTHING-AMPLIFIED SOCIAL MEDIA THE MEDIA AND FANS OVER-LOVE CELEBRITIES AND THEN OVER-DENOUNCE THEM IF THEY ARE PERCEIVED TO HAVE FOULED. THIS HEIGHTENED ATMOSPHERE IS JUVENILE OVERBLOWN AND PERFECTLY SUITED TO A BREAKING NEWS CYCLE TABLOID TITILLATION AND 140 CHARACTERS. WE??D ALL BE BETTER THINKING OF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH SCHUMER AND LAWRENCE AS NOT ONLY ONE BETWEEN ADULTS BUT ALSO AS A SANELY DISTANT ONE BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND THEIR ENTERTAINERS. THEY AREN??T OUR BEST FRIENDS AND THEY SHOULDN??T BE TREATED AS SYMBOLS OR ICONS OF ANYTHING. WE PAY TO WATCH THEM PERFORM THEY PERFORM FOR US. ANYWAY IT??S HARD NOT TO THINK THE MEDIA WILL SWOON ONCE AGAIN ESPECIALLY WHEN WE SEE THE MOVIE SCHUMER AND LAWRENCE ARE MAKING IN WHICH THEY ARE SET TO PLAY SISTERS.

AFTER I GOT BACK TO THE SHOP THE KEEPER CALLED ME UP BEFORE HIM (WHICH I DID NO MORE CARE ABOUT THAN IF I HAD NEVER STOOD BEFORE HIM BEFORE FOR I BEGAN TO GET USE TO HIS CALLS) AND ASK ME IF I CERTAINLY MEANT TO BREAK OVER AND RUN THROUGH THOSE BRIGHT AND GOLDEN RULES OF HIS. I TRIED TO MAKE SOME EXCUSE FOR BREAKING OVER THAT RULE. I TRIED TO FIND A MANTLE TO COVER THE DEED BUT ALL IN VAIN. I HAD BROKEN THE RULE AND FORGOTTEN THE ADVICE OF MR. TYLOR AND NOW I WAS ARRAIGNED AND STOOD CONVICTED AND MUST SUFFER THE PENALTY OF IT BY SUFFERING UNDER THE BENDING AND BITING GALLS OF THE OLD CAT AND BE LOCK UP IN THE DUNGEON UNTIL THE NEXT MORNING. NEVER WILL I FORGET THAT BRIGHT AND PALMY DAY OF JULY AS I WAS STROLLING TO THE HOSPITAL THAT I OVERTOOK MILLS WHO HAD BEEN AN INMATE WITH ME IN THE HOUSE OF REFUGE AND FELL IN A CONVERSATION WITH HIM UNTIL ONE OF THE RELIEF OFFICERS STEPPED UP TO US AND ASK US OUR NAMES AND THE NAME OF THE SHOPS THAT WE BELONG TO. ON MY RETURNING BACK TO THE SHOP FROM THE HOSPITAL I FOUND THAT THE RELIEF KEEPER HAD CAUGHT US A TALKING AND HAD REPORTED US TO OUR RESPECTED KEEPERS FOR TALKING. THE KEEPER CALLED ME UP TO HIS DESK AND ASK ME WHO THAT YOUNG CHAP WAS THAT I WAS TALKING TO AND WHAT WE WAS TALKING ABOUT. ??I SEE? SAID THE OFFICER ??THAT YOU DON??T TRY NOR MEAN TO GET ALONG HERE WITHOUT SUFFERING UNDER THE LASH EVERY DAY.

COOK THE WARDEN OF THE PRISON CAME THROUGH THE SHOP AND THE KEEPER TOOK HIM ONE SIDE AND WHISPERED SOMETHING INTO HIS EAR ABOUT ME. THEY HELD A LONG CONVERSATION ABOUT ME FOR SOME MINUTES WHILE I STOOD WITH MY FACE TOWARDS THE DESK. AFTER THEY HAD GOT THROUGH WITH THERE THEIR CONVERSATION ESQ. COOK TOOK HIS SEAT BEHIND THE KEEPER??S DESK AND IN A RASH AND AN UGLY TONE THE KEEPER CALLED ME IN THE PRESENCE OF ESQ. COOK AND SAID ??THIS BOY ESQ. IS BECOMING A HARDEN CONVICT. HE IS LISTENING TO THE SILLY TALES AND COUNSELS OF THE OLDER INMATES AND FOLLOWING THEIR DEVILISH VICES AND LEARNING ALL THE INIQUITIES AND MISERIES THAT IS PREVAILING WITHIN THE PRISON. HE IS LETTING THESE OLDER INMATES HAVE THEIR INFLUENCE OVER HIM AND LEARNING TO PLAY THEIR MEAN AND DEVILISH TRICKS AND WHAT TO DO WITH HIM I KNOW NOT. I HAVE WHIP HIM UNTIL THE BLOOD CAME STREAMING FROM HIS BACK AND IT APPEARS TO HAVE NO EFFECT UPON THE BOY AT ALL. WHAT TO DO WITH HIM SIR I CANNOT TELL. I AM TIRED OF THROWING THE LASH UPON HIS BACK. HE IS A SMART BOY AND SEEMS TO BE ENDOWN WITH GOOD REASONS AND FACTUALITIES AND IF I LET HIM LEAD THE COURSE THAT HE IS NOW A LEADING HE WILL SURELY BECOME AN HARDEN CONVICT AND ONE DAY OR ANOTHER WILL BE LOADED DOWN WITH HEAVY BALLS AND CHAINS AND BECOME THE INMATE OF A DARK AND A GLOOMY DUNGEON. WHAT SHALL I DO WITH HIM ESQ.? I KNOW NO OTHER WAY TO DO ONLY TO PUT HIM OVER INTO YOUR HANDS AND INTO YOUR HANDS I NOW PLACE THE HARDEN YOUTH. TAKE HIM AND ACT OUT YOUR OWN PLEASURE WITH HIM.? THE READER MUST HAVE SOME IDEA OF THE FEELINGS OF MY MIND DURING THAT CONVERSATION OF THE WARDEN??S AND THE KEEPER. THERE I STOOD A NOTHING BUT A MERE BOY BEFORE TWO OFFICERS A WEEPING AND CRYING. HORRORS HORRORS HORRORS ETERNAL HORROR OF HORRORS CAME BEATING AND PEALTING UPON MY MIND. ??YOU SAY? SAID ESQ. COOK TO THE OFFICER WHO STOOD WITH THE CATS IN HIS HAND ??THAT YOU DON??T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH YON BOY.? ??NO SIR? THE OFFICER REPLIED. ??IT WAS ONLY YESTERDAY THAT I GAVE HIM A SEVERE PUNISHMENT AND NOW I GIVE THE YOUTH OVER INTO YOUR HANDS THAT HE MAY PASS THROUGH HARD AND ROUGH TREATMENT.? AS THE OFFICER SAID THESE WORDS ESQ. COOK ASK HIM WHAT KIND OF TREATMENT I HAD BEEN THROUGH BESIDES THE CATS. ??HAVE YOU CONSIGN HIM IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT YET?? ??YES SIR? SAID THE OFFICER. ??I HAVE CONSIGN HIM AWAY TO A DARK AND A GLOOMY DUNGEON AND FED HIM ON BREAD AND WATER ONCE A DAY AND IT HAS HAD NO EFFECT UPON THE BOY AT ALL AND IF HE IS ALLOWED TO GO ON IN THE PATH WHICH HE IS NOW TREADING HE WILL BE THE RINGLEADER OF ALL THE VICES AND CRIMES THAT ARE PREVAILING WITHIN THE WALLS OF A GLOOMY PRISON.? ??INTO YOUR HANDS? SAID ESQ. COOK ??WILL I COMMEND YON BOY. SEE THAT YOU GO UNDER A HARD AND ROUGH TREATMENT WITH HIM FIRST WITH THE CATS. THEN AFTER THAT GIVE HIM OVER INTO MY HANDS AND I??LL SEE WHAT VIRTUE THERE IS IN THE STOCKS. THEN IF HE KEEPS ON LEADING THE CAREER THAT HE NOW LEADS THE CRACK OF THE PISTOL SHALL PROVE HIS DESTINY.? AS ESQ. COOK SAID THESE WORDS THE OFFICER ORDERED ME TO PULL OFF MY SHIRT. I OBEYED HIS AUTHORITY AND TOOK OFF MY SHIRT AND HE SUNK FORTY AND TWO BLOWS INTO MY BACK WITH THE CATS. AFTER I HAD PUT ON MY SHIRT ESQ. COOK ORDERED ME TO FOLLOW HIM. LIKE A DOG WITH HIS TAIL HANGING DOWN TO THE GROUND DID I FOLLOW THIS VENERABLE GENTLEMAN WHOSE GRAY HAIRS I HONOR AND RESPECT TO THIS VERY DAY. PRESSING HIS WAY ONWARD HE LED ME TO THE SOUTH WING AND ENCLOSED ME IN A LARGE BOX WHICH THEY CALLED THE STOCKS AND MADE MY HANDS FEET AND HEAD FAST SO AS I COULD NOT STIR MY BODY AT ALL. THESE STOCKS WHEN CLOSED AND MADE FAST ARE AS DARK AND BLACK AS MIDNIGHT. IT BENUMBS THE HANDS AND FEET AND STOPS THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD FOR A LONG TIME. NOT A SPARK OR ONE SINGLE RAY OF LIGHT IS THERE TO BE SEEN UNTIL THE OFFICER SEES FIT TO OPEN THE DOOR AND LET HIS CAPTIVE FREE. IT WAS LATE IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN I HEARD THE HEAVY TRAMP OF TWO OFFICERS MAKING THEIR WAY TO THE BOX WHERE I WAS CONSIGN. THE HEAVY WEIGHTS OF THEIR CANES COMING DOWN UPON THE FLOOR SEEMED TO TELL ME THAT THEY WAS THE VERY ONES WHO HAD CONSIGN ME TO THE STOCKS. AS THEY APPROACH THIS BOX OF TORTURE THEY UNLOCK THE DOOR AND MADE MY HANDS AND FEET FREE FROM TORTURE AND PAIN AND ORDERED ME BACK TO THE SHOP. SLOWLY AND SADLY DID I PACE MY WAY BACK TO THE SHOP IN A PENSIVE MANNER WHILE THE KEEPER KEPT CLOSE UP AT MY HEELS WITH A BIG HICKORY CANE IN HIS HAND. THE READER MUST IMAGINE TO HIMSELF HOW I FELT AND THE PAIN I WAS UNDER GOIN?? AND BEARING AFTER GOIN?? THROUGH THIS TREATMENT OF PUNISHMENT. YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT I FELT WEARY AND FAINT AND WAS GLAD ENOUGH TO LAY MY HEAD DOWN UPON THE COLD FLOOR AS SOON AS I ENTERED MY CELL AND THOUGH IT WAS STRICTLY AGAINST THE RULE FOR THE CONVICT TO SWING HIS HAMMOCK BEFORE THE BELL RUNG AT EIGHT O??CLOCK FOR HIM TO TURN IN YET SO FAINT AND EXHAUSTED WAS I THAT I SWUNG MY BED JUST AS SOON AS I ENTERED MY CELL. THE NIGHT GUARD CAME ALONG AND LOOK INTO MY CELL AND FOUND ME COVERED UP IN BED. ??HALOO. HERE? SAID HE ??COME UP HERE TO THE DOOR SIR.? I GOT UP ON MY HANDS AND KNEES AND CREEP TO THE DOOR AS WELL AS I COULD SUFFERING WITH PAIN AT EVERY INCH I MOVED. ??WHO TOLD YOU TO GO TO BED SIR?? SAID THE GUARD. ??WHO GAVE YOU PERMISSION SIR? DON??T YOU KNOW THAT IT IS AGAINST THE RULES FOR YOU TO SWING YOUR HAMMOCK?? ??SIR? SAID I ??THE PAINS AND SUFFERINGS WHICH I HAVE ENDURED THIS DAY HAS CAUSED ME TO BREAK OVER THIS RULE.? ??DON??T CARE? SAID HE ??IF A MAN IS BREATHING HIS LAST BREATH OF LIFE HE IS NO BUSINESS TO BREAK OVER THE RULES AND GO TO BED WITHOUT PERMISSION. GET UP SIR AND PUT ON YOUR CLOTHES.? IN VAIN DID I TRY TO REASON AND EXPOSTULATE WITH THE HARD AND COLD HEARTED DEVIL BUT ALL OF MY TEARS AND BEGGING AND REASONING AND ROUGH AND CRUEL TREATMENT COULDN??T MAKE ANY EFFECT ON THIS COLD HEARTED DEVIL??S HEART BUT WENT RIGHT OFF AND GOT THE KEY OF MY CELL DOOR AND UNLOCK IT AND ORDERED ME TO FOLLOW HIM DOWN STAIRS. PENSIVELY AND SLOWLY DID I FOLLOW THE DEMON DOWN STAIRS WHILE THE COLD CLODS OF BLOOD STILL CLUNG TO MY BACK GROPING MY WAY DOWN THE STAIRS. HE LED ME OUT INTO THE KITCHEN AND ORDER ME TO PULL OFF MY SHIRT. I STRIP MYSELF AND TURNED MY BACK AROUND TOWARDS THE CRUEL HEARTED GUARD AND ALL THE MARKS AND BLOOD THAT CAME OOZING FROM MY BACK COULDN??T SOFTEN THE HEART OF THAT GUARD AND HE LAID FOUR LIGHT LASHES UPON MY BACK WITH THE CATS.

THE FINAL SEASON OF DOWNTON ABBEY BEGAN WITH THE GALLOPING HOOVES OF HORSES AND YAPPING OF HOUNDS MASSING FOR A DAY??S HUNTING.?Ÿ IT WAS AN APPOSITE OPENING SCENE: THE PACE IN THIS OPENING EPISODE WAS FAST??NOT CRAZY-FAST BUT FAST-PRECISE??WITH DOWNTON??S WRITER-CREATOR JULIAN FELLOWES AT HIS BEST. DRAMA AND COMEDY THE CHEESY AND THE HEARTFELT ALL MELDED PERFECTLY AND GOSH QUICKLY. YES DOWNTON THE GORGEOUS ENGLISH COUNTRY HOUSE WITH ITS WARRENOUSLY PLOTTED WORLD OF MASTERS MISTRESSES AND SERVANTS IS IN PERIL AGAIN. WHEN HAS IT EVER BEEN NOT? IN A MIRROR OF MODERN TIMES THE TALK WAS OF CUTTING BACK OF FALLING REVENUES AND A NECESSITY OF TIGHTENING BELTS AND A SENSE THAT THE ROLE AND NATURE OF BEING WAITED UPON WAS BECOMING DEFUNCT.?Ÿ THIS BEING DOWNTON THE SERIOUSNESS OF THAT AND THE HISTORICAL REFERENCES TO THE WAGES BILL AND THE LIKE WAS UNDERCUT BY THE DEFTLY WRITTEN HUMOR OF THE COUNTESS DOWAGER??S LADY-MAID (DENKER PLAYED BY SUE JOHNSTON) STIRRING THE POT AMONG THE SERVANTS ABOUT WHO MIGHT GET THE CHOP. FELLOWES RUNS A STRICT MORAL UNIVERSE SO HER ATTEMPTS TO FRIGHTEN BOTH THE MAIN HOUSE UNDER-STAIRS STAFF AND HER NEMESIS THE COUNTESS DOWAGER??S BUTLER SPRATT (JEREMY SWIFT??BRILLIANTLY SNARKY SMARMY AND BUMBLING) BACKFIRED WITH VIOLET CRAWLEY THE COUNTESS DOWAGER (MAGGIE SMITH ON AS-PER GREAT WITHERING FORM) INTIMATING FALSELY THAT DENKER HERSELF MIGHT GET THE BULLET. VIOLET SAID SHE DID SO BECAUSE SHE LIKED TO RULE BY FEAR AND THIS WAS APPARENT IN ANOTHER SUBPLOT IN WHICH SHE ISOBEL CRAWLEY (PENELOPE WILTON) AND THE PREVIOUSLY STORYLINE-FREE LISTLESS CORA (ELIZABETH MCGOVERN) BECOME INVOLVED IN A BATTLE ROYALE FOR CONTROL OF THE LOCAL HOSPITAL??BASICALLY SHOULD IT RUN ITSELF OR BE RUN BY A LARGER HEALTH AUTHORITY. ??DOES IT EVER GET COLD ON THE MORAL HIGH GROUND? THE COUNTESS DOWAGER ASKED ISOBEL THAT MAGNIFICENT LIP CURL DIALED TO THE MAX. AS THIS RUMBLED ON AND LORD GRANTHAM (HUGH BONNEVILLE) WONDERED HOW TO KEEP THE ESTATE GOING HIS DAUGHTERS MARY (MICHELLE DOCKERY) AND EDITH (LAURA CARMICHAEL) THREW LIGHT SHADE IN EACH OTHER??S DIRECTION AS THEIR OWN LIVES PROGRESSED. MARY STARTED BY ALMOST BEING BLACKMAILED BY A FORMER CHAMBERMAID WHO KNOWS SHE HAD ILLICIT NOOKY WITH LORD GILLINGHAM IN LIVERPOOL. THIS PROTO-VILLAIN RITA BEVAN BROUGHT WITH HER??AS THE BOLSHIER WORKING CLASS CHARACTERS IN DOWNTON ABBEY SOMETIMES DO??AN ELEMENT OF CLASS WARFARE WHICH FELLOWES IS VERY RUM ABOUT. EVENTUALLY AND COMPLETELY IMPLAUSIBLY BEVAN WAS DESPATCHED WITH FIFTY POUNDS AND A FLEA IN HER EAR BY LORD GRANTHAM. IT??S THE KIND OF DOWNTON PLOT WHICH RUMBLES BAROQUELY INTO LIFE THEN??DOES FELLOWES JUST GET BORED WRITING ONE WONDERS???FIZZLES TO NOTHING. THE CONCLUSION FOR LORD GRANTHAM WATCHING MARY??S INDECISIVE HANDLING OF THIS SITUATION WAS??EQUALLY BAFFLINGLY??THAT SHE WOULD MAKE AN EXCELLENT STEWARD OF DOWNTON SO MARY WILL NOW HELP RUN THE HOUSE??S AFFAIRS. YOU SENSE AT MOMENTS LIKE THIS FELLOWES LOOKING AT HIS COMPUTER SCREEN AND GOING ??FUCK IT IF THEY SAY IT QUICK ENOUGH AND WITH A SMILE AND WE PUT SOME ORCHESTRAL MUSIC IN NO-ONE WILL QUESTION IT.? QUITE RIGHT WE??RE BUSTED. HOWEVER MOMENTS IN THIS HOKUM-Y PLOT ALSO SHOWED THOSE CRYSTALLIZING MOMENTS OF DOWNTON AT ITS BEST AND SWEETEST??SUCH AS MARY QUIETLY WONDERING ALOUD TO CARSON (JIM CARTER) WHAT COULD SHE DO THAT HE WOULD EVER CONDEMN HER FOR. THERE IS SOMETHING ETERNALLY HEART-TUGGING ABOUT THESE MOMENTS BETWEEN HER THE LADY AND HIM THE SERVANT AND SECOND FATHER WHO HAS WATCHED HER GROW UP??UTTERLY MANIPULATIVE TO SCRIPT AND WATCH UTTERLY WINNING EVERY TIME. CARTER??S ABILITY TO SWITCH BETWEEN THE GRUFF MASTER OF DOWNSTAIRS SNAPPING AT THE SERVANTS TO DO THEIR WORK AND THEN BUMBLING IN MATTERS MORE PERSONAL WAS ITSELF BEAUTIFULLY CAUGHT IN THE MINI-TALE OF HOW HE AND MRS. HUGHES (PHYLLIS LOGAN AND MRS H.??S FIRST NAME IS ELSIE WE FOUND OUT) MAY BE ??FULL? HUSBAND AND WIFE. THE TWO MOST POLITE AND RESTRAINED SERVANTS ARE GETTING TOGETHER BUT SHE DIDN??T KNOW IF HE EXPECTED HER TO HAVE SEX. HOW WOULD THEY BE INTIMATE WITH EACH OTHER SHE WORRIED TO MRS. PATMORE (LESLEY NICOL).?Ÿ ALL OF THIS WAS PLAYED OUT IN PERIOD LANGUAGE AND WITH ALL THE DISCOMFORT OF NOT JUST ALL THREE PERSONALITIES BUT THE MORES OF THE TIME. IT LED TO MRS. HUGHES ENLISTING MRS. PATMORE TO ASK MR. CARSON WHAT HE EXPECTED AND??AFTER SPEAKING AT CROSS PURPOSES??A WONDERFUL SCENE WHERE MR. CARTER NOT ONLY EXPRESSED HE HOPED THEY WOULD HAVE A ??FULL? MARRIAGE BUT ALSO THE DEPTH OF HIS LOVE FOR MRS. HUGHES. THIS BOTH MOVING AND FUNNY DANCE AROUND SEXUAL POLITESSE WAS PLAYED TO PERFECTION BY ALL THREE ACTORS. IF YOU HADN??T CRIED AT MR. CARSON??S CUTELY GROWLED ??I LOVE HER I AM TICKLED BY HER I AM BURSTING WITH PRIDE THAT SHE WOULD BE MY WIFE? DECLARATION OF LOVE FOR MRS. HUGHES TO MRS. PATMORE THE TRAVAILS OF MR. AND MRS. BATES (BRENDAN COYLE AND JOANNE FROGGATT) WOULD HAVE HAD YOU REACHING FOR BOTH A HEADACHE TABLET AND ANOTHER BOX OF TISSUES. AFTER WHAT SEEMS LIKE TWO LIFETIMES OF THEM SWAPPING THE COURTROOM DOCK AND JAIL CELL WITH EACH OTHER OVER MURDERS NEITHER COMMITTED BUT BOTH WERE ACCUSED OF IT WAS LEFT TO MRS. BATES TO BE FINALLY EXONERATED FOR PUSHING HER RAPIST MR. GREEN UNDER A BUS. IN ANOTHER LIGHTNING PIECE OF PLOTTING WHICH MADE LITTLE SENSE (THOUGH DOWNTON FANS KNOW TO SHRUG AT THE SHOW??S STRANGE STITCHING) IT TURNED OUT ANOTHER WOMAN DID IT JUST CAME FORWARD AND APOLOGIZED AND YEP THAT WAS THAT. FOR SOMETHING THAT FELT LIKE IT HAD BEEN GOING ON SINCE THE LATE EDWARDIAN ERA IT WAS OVER IN FIVE SECONDS. BUT THIS IS MR. AND MRS. BATES THE MOST MISERABLE TROUBLED COUPLE IN THE WORLD. ON A SUNNY DAY THEY??D TRAVEL THOUSANDS OF MILES TO FIND A CLOUD TO SIT UNDER. AND SO EVEN BEFORE THE POLICEMAN HAD DELIVERED THE NOMINALLY GOOD NEWS THAT FOR ONCE NEITHER OF THEM WAS UNDER SUSPICION OF MURDER UNHAPPINESS WAS THEIRS AGAIN: MRS. BATES THOUGHT SHE WAS PREGNANT BUT SHE WASN??T AND THIS WASN??T THE FIRST TIME SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS PREGNANT BUT WASN??T AND??SHE WEPT??MR. BATES NO MATTER HOW MUCH HE TELLS HER THAT HE LOVES HER AND IT DOESN??T MATTER IT REALLY DOES BECAUSE SHE CAN??T GIVE HIM WHAT HE WANTS. A BABY. GIVE US ALL STRENGTH. BASICALLY FELLOW FANS: THERE MAY NOT BE ANOTHER MURDER CHARGE (YET) BUT FELLOWES HAS FOUND ANOTHER AGONIZING LONG-TERM POISON FOR MR. AND MRS. BATES?? TORTURED RELATIONSHIP. INDEED THE ONLY PEOPLE HAPPY ABOUT MRS. BATES?? FREEDOM WAS??WELL??EVERY OTHER CHARACTER INDEED THE OCCASION DEMANDED ONE OF THOSE RARE MOMENTS WHEN ??UPSTAIRS?? VISITED ??DOWNSTAIRS?? TO CELEBRATE. A GRAMOPHONE WAS EVEN PRODUCED SO THE PROLES COULD ENJOY SOME DANCING FOR GOODNESS SAKE??AND AS LORD GRANTHAM AVAILED HIMSELF FROM SOME SNACKS FROM MRS. PATMORE??S FRIDGE ONE OF CARSON??S RAISED BUSHY EYEBROWS REMINDED HIM WHOSE TERRITORY HE WAS INVADING AND TO BE RESPECTFUL OF THAT. OF FELLOWES?? TWO LONGEST-STANDING OUTLETS FOR NARRATIVE PUNISHMENT THERE WAS A MIXED EVENING. KITCHEN-HAND DAISY (SOPHIE MCSHERA) STANDING UP FOR HER DEAD LOVED ONE??S DAD??S RIGHT TO TENANT HIS FARM (YES DEEP BREATHS REQUIRED AGAIN) LED HER TO CONFRONT THE NEW OWNER OF HIS FARM. FOR SOME REASON HER VERBAL ATTACK WAS CONSIDERED POTENTIAL GROUNDS FOR SACKING DAISY AND NO-ONE??PUBLICLY OR PRIVATELY??STOOD UP FOR HER OR EVEN CONGRATULATED HER BRAVERY. HAS ANYONE ELSE GOT A CRUSH ON MR. MASON (PAUL COPLEY) THE GOODLY TENANT FARMER IN QUESTION? JUST ME? OK. FELLOWES??S OTHER CONSISTENT OUTLET FOR SADISM HAD A WORRYING PERK IN HER STEP. LADY EDITH HAS BECOME A MEDIA MAGNATE AND IS MULLING A MOVE TO LONDON. THERE SHE COULD SWAN AMONG THE BLOOMSBURY SET AND NO-ONE WOULD QUESTION WHO MARIGOLD HER SECRET DAUGHTER BEING PASSED OFF AS AN ORPHAN WAS??BECAUSE ERM (*FELLOWES TYPES QUICKLY*) LONDON IS SO BIG. THIS WAS HILARIOUS NOT LEAST BECAUSE LADY EDITH IS VERY RICH AND MOVING IN HIGH SOCIETY AND PEOPLE WOULD ABSOLUTELY ASK WHO THE YOUNG CHILD SHE WAS PARENTING WAS.?Ÿ SO BOTH LADY MARY AND LADY EDITH ARE NOW SINGLE AND POWERFUL??AND ONE SENSES THAT FORMERLY EVIL FOOTMAN BARROW (ROBERT JAMES COLLIER) MAY ALSO BE EITHER LOOKING TO SPREAD HIS WINGS OR BED THE NEW HOT SERVANT WHO EVERYONE RATHER MEANLY KEEPS TRYING TO WARN HIM AWAY FROM.?Ÿ STOLEN SMILES BETWEEN THEM MAY SUGGEST A FRISSON??WHICH ALSO SEEMS TO THRUM BETWEEN MOLESLEY (KEVIN DOYLE) AND BAXTER (RAQUEL CASSIDY) WHO HELPED GET MRS. BATES OFF THE MURDER CHARGE THROUGH SOME SLEUTHING AND WHOSE GOOD CHARACTERS WERE ELOQUENTLY SUMMARIZED IN THANKS BY MR. BATES. THIS DELICIOUSLY FAST PITHY NUTTY EMOTIONAL EPISODE ENDED WITH MRS. HUGHES AND MR. CARSON IN AN EMBRACE FOLLOWING ANOTHER POTENTIAL MISUNDERSTANDING (THERE??S GOING TO BE A FEW OF THESE BORNE BY THEIR PENT-UP NATURES YOU SENSE). SHE SAYING HE COULD HAVE HER ??WARTS AND ALL? WAS QUOTING OLIVER CROMWELL??AND THAT PHRASE ALSO PRETTY SUMS UP THE NECESSARY ACCEPTANCE FANS TAKE ON WATCHING DOWNTON. WE ACCEPT IT FOR ALL ITS FLAWS PLOT LEAPS PLOT HOLES AND CHARACTER INCONSISTENCIES BECAUSE IT ALSO HAS ITS OWN BEAUTY AND SOLID EMOTIONAL HEART. WE??LL BE WITH IT TO THE END HOWEVER MADDENING THE JOURNEY. ,22811.0

1398,10430386.0,2016-01-30T05:01:00+00:00,HOW GIN BECAME THE METH OF 18TH CENTURY ENGLAND,IT DOESN??T GET MORE CLASSIC THAN GIN. THE SPIRIT IS OF COURSE WHAT SUPER SPY JAMES BOND ORDERS IN?ŸCASINO ROYALE?ŸAND THE BASE OF COUNTLESS SNOOTY COUNTRY CLUB CONCOCTIONS. (CARE FOR A GIN MARTINI OR A GIN & TONIC?)?Ÿ AND RECENTLY THANKS TO THE REBIRTH OF THE COCKTAIL THE LIQUOR IS THE DARLING OF THE CURRENT GENERATION OF MIXOLOGISTS AND DISTILLERS. SO THE NEXT TIME YOU??RE FEELING ALL HIGH AND MIGHTY AT A FAUX-SPEAKEASY AS YOU ENJOY A $15 WHITE LADY OR GIN GIMLET MADE WITH A SPIRIT INFUSED WITH MORE THAN A DOZEN BOTANICALS FROM A TINY PRODUCER IN SAY THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER GIN??S MUCH HUMBLER ORIGINS. AS HAUGHTY AS ITS REPUTATION MAY BE NOW??WITH DEVOTEES ARGUING OVER THE SUBTLE DIFFERENCES AMONG THE DOZENS AND DOZENS OF BRANDS ON STORE SHELVES??GIN??S EARLY HISTORY WAS REALLY QUITE A BIT ROUGHER. AND I??M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT ITS DRINKABILITY. THERE IS NO EASY WAY TO SAY THIS BUT GIN WAS LIKE THE METH OF 1700S ENGLAND. FOR REAL. WHILE ITS PRODUCTION DIDN??T INVOLVE EXPLODING RVS IN CORNFIELDS OR MASS SUDAFED HEISTS GIN WREAKED SIGNIFICANT HAVOC ON SOCIETY WITH JUST ABOUT EVERY LONDONER EITHER MAKING THE SPIRIT OR CONSUMING VAST QUANTITIES OF IT. ITS CRITICS BLAMED IT FOR A RANGE OF SOCIETAL MALADIES INCLUDING CRIME LAWLESSNESS AND OF COURSE BLIND INTOXICATION. SO HOW DID IT ALL START? THE ROOTS OF GIN GO BACK TO THE NETHERLANDS WHERE ITS PRECURSOR GENEVA OR GENEVER WAS FIRST MADE IN THE MID-1600S. IT WAS ??PRODUCED IN SMALL LABORATORIES SET UP BY PHYSICIANS AND CHEMISTS? SAYS ALEX WERNER HEAD OF HISTORY COLLECTIONS AT THE MUSEUM OF LONDON. DURING THE 1680S THE DUTCH AND THE ENGLISH WERE QUITE CONNECTED IN TIMES OF BOTH PEACE AND WAR. ??BRITISH SOLDIERS FIGHTING IN THE LOW COUNTRIES LIKED GIN? SAYS WERNER. A SHOT OF SO-CALLED DUTCH COURAGE ALSO SUPPOSEDLY FORTIFIED SOLDIERS BEFORE THEY STEPPED INTO BATTLE. BUT WHAT REALLY BOOSTED ITS PRODUCTION IN ENGLAND WAS AN ACT IN THE 1690S DESIGNED TO INCREASE THE DOMESTIC SPIRITS INDUSTRY. ??THE DUTY OF GIN WAS SET AT A LOW RATE AND ANYONE WAS FREE TO DISTILL AND SELL GIN??THERE WERE VERY FEW REGULATIONS IN FORCE? EXPLAINS WERNER. ??WEALTHY LANDOWNERS PROMOTED GIN PRODUCTION AND RETAILING AS THEY HAD SURPLUS OF GRAIN EACH YEAR.??Ÿ BUT THE ACT WAS TOO SUCCESSFUL: THE AMOUNT OF GIN DRUNK SKYROCKETED FROM 572000 GALLONS IN 1684 ACCORDING TO DAVE BROOM??S RECENTLY PUBLISHED GIN THE MANUAL TO EIGHT MILLION GALLONS BY 1742. ??LONDON WAS IN CRISIS. THE CITY??S BIRTH RATE FELL BETWEEN 1720 AND 1750 WHILE THE DEATH RATE ROSE? WROTE BROOM. THE GIN CRAZE WAS FINALLY BROUGHT UNDER CONTROL WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE GIN ACT OF 1751. IT ??PROHIBITED GIN DISTILLERS FROM SELLING TO UNLICENSED MERCHANTS RESTRICTED LICENSES AND IMPOSED SEVERE PUNISHMENTS FOR BREAKING THE LAW? SAYS WERNER. ??ALSO THERE WERE POOR HARVESTS IN 1751 WHICH LED TO DRAMATIC INCREASES IN THE PRICE OF GRAIN.? (TO GIVE THE ACT CREDENCE WILLIAM HOGARTH MADE HIS INFAMOUS PRINT GIN LANE WHICH PORTRAYS A DEPRAVED GIN-FUELED SCENE IN THE LONDON SLUMS.) AFTER THIS METEORIC RISE AND EQUALLY IMPRESSIVE CRASH GIN SLOWLY MADE THE TRANSITION FROM LOWBROW TO HIGHBROW. (I DON??T HOWEVER PREDICT METH TRAVELING ALONG THAT ROAD TO RESPECTABILITY ANY TIME SOON.) BY THE GOLDEN AGE OF THE COCKTAIL WHICH STARTED IN ROUGHLY THE 1860S AND LASTED TO JUST BEFORE WORLD WAR I GIN WAS A GO-TO LIQUOR OF AMERICA??S PIONEERING AND PROLIFIC BARTENDERS. THAT EXPLAINS WHY SO MANY CLASSIC DRINKS WHICH ARE ENDURINGLY POPULAR AND CAN STILL BE FOUND ON MENUS ACROSS THE COUNTRY TODAY CALL FOR THE SPIRIT. HISTORIC GIN CONCOCTIONS ARE PARTICULARLY POPULAR IN CRAFT COCKTAIL LOUNGES SINCE THE BARTENDERS WHO WORK AT THESE TYPES OF ESTABLISHMENTS MINE OLD DRINKS BOOKS FOR RECIPES AND INSPIRATION. THEY ALSO GIVE THE BURGEONING NUMBER OF CRAFT DISTILLERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY A MARKET FOR THEIR ARTISANAL GINS. THE SPIRIT IS A POPULAR ONE TO MAKE SINCE THE STANDARD VERSION REQUIRES NO BARREL AGING AND CAN BE SOLD ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. (CONTRAST THAT WITH WHISKY WHICH NEEDS YEARS OF PRICY AGING AS WELL AS EXPENSIVE BARRELS TO MATURE IN.) INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH THE OVERALL MARKET FOR GIN IS NOT PARTICULARLY HEALTHY WITH THE CATEGORY LOSING MARKET SHARE OVER THE LAST DECADE. BUT BOUTIQUE AND PREMIUM BRANDS ARE POPULAR WITH MIXOLOGISTS AND WILL CONTINUE TO GROW. THAT??S LUCKY FOR US SINCE GIN AND ITS SOPHISTICATEDLY COOL COCKTAILS WON??T BE GOING AWAY ANY TIME SOON. ,26727.0

(A) THE NUMBER OF REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES OR (B) THE NUMBER OF NEW ENGLISH TRANSLATIONS OF HOMER??S ILIAD PUBLISHED IN THE LAST DECADE. IF YOU ANSWERED (A) YOU??D BE RIGHT BUT BY A VERY SLIM MARGIN. LAST MONTH WITH THE ARRIVAL OF CAROLINE ALEXANDER??S VERSION OF HOMER??S GREAT EPIC??THE FIRST EVER BY A WOMAN IF THAT MATTERS??THE ILIADS DREW JUST JUST ONE SHY OF THE NINE REPUBLICAN CONTENDERS WHO APPEARED IN DECEMBER??S DEBATE. GIVEN THE INCREASINGLY RAPID PACE AT WHICH NEW ILIADS KEEP EMERGING WE WILL LIKELY SEE ANOTHER BEFORE THE IOWA CAUCUSES??ALL THIS WHILE OLDER VERSIONS OF THE POEM SOME DATING BACK CENTURIES CONTINUE TO GET REISSUED WITH NEW NOTES INTRODUCTIONS AND COVER ILLUSTRATIONS. FOR READERS AND FOR TEACHERS LIKE MYSELF THE RANGE OF CHOICE HAS BECOME BEWILDERING. SOME TRANSLATORS PREFER A FIVE-BEAT LINE OF VERSE (LIKE SHAKESPEARE??S) OTHERS SOMETHING CLOSER TO THE SIX-BEAT LINE OF THE ORIGINAL STILL OTHERS BLEND THE TWO OR AS IN ALEXANDER??S CASE STICK TO NO CLEAR METRICAL SCHEME AT ALL (??A CADENCE?? WHICH VARIES FROM VERSE TO VERSE? AS SHE DESCRIBES IT IN HER INTRODUCTION). DO YOU FANCY RHYMED COUPLETS? THE ONCE-GREAT VERSIONS BY GEORGE CHAPMAN AND ALEXANDER POPE HAVE BEEN RECENTLY REPACKAGED AS HAS THE PROSE VERSION BY VICTORIAN NOVELIST SAMUEL BUTLER. AND FOR THOSE WHO PREFER MODERNIST TWISTS ON ANCIENT CLASSICS CHRISTOPHER LOGUE??S WAR MUSIC??A REIMAGINING OF HOMER??S EPIC IN AN IMAGISTIC STYLE??WILL APPEAR IN A NEW MORE COMPLETE VERSION NEXT MONTH AUGMENTED BY MATERIAL LOGUE LEFT UNFINISHED IN HIS DECLINING YEARS AFTER WORKING ON THE POEM ON AND OFF FOR FIVE DECADES. TRANSLATION PROLIFERATION IS CERTAINLY NOT AMONG THE 10 WORST OF THE ANXIETIES AFFLICTING THE MODERN WORLD BUT IT IS OF A PIECE WITH OTHERS HIGHER UP THE LIST. SWARTHMORE PSYCHOLOGIST BARRY SCHWARTZ BEGINS HIS 2005 BOOK THE PARADOX OF CHOICE WITH A STROLL THROUGH A MIDSIZE AMERICAN GROCERY STORE WITH ITS HUNDREDS OF CRACKER VARIETIES SCORES OF SUNBLOCK CHOICES AND SEVEN VARIETIES OF CHEERIOS (A NUMBER THAT HAS SINCE EXPANDED WELL INTO DOUBLE DIGITS). THOSE ALREADY OPPRESSED BY THE OVERABUNDANCE OF THE MALLS AND MARKETS NOW HAVE TO COPE WITH IT ALSO IN THE BOOKSTORE A PLACE ONE USED TO GO KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT ONE WANTED AND WHAT ONE WAS GOING TO GET. THE BARNES & NOBLE WEBSITE LISTS 173 BOOKS UNDER THE WORDS ??THE ILIAD? WHILE AMAZON LISTS 179 (MANY OF THESE ARE SUMMARIES OR READER??S GUIDES BUT DOZENS ARE FULL TRANSLATIONS). IT WAS NOT EVER THUS. CLASSICS GRADUATE STUDENTS IN THE 1980S (OF WHOM I WAS ONE) DEBATED THE RELATIVE MERITS OF RICHMOND LATTIMORE AND ROBERT FITZGERALD THE ONLY TWO ILIADS THEN IN WIDE CIRCULATION. A NEW VERSION BY ROBERT FAGLES APPEARED IN 1990 AND FOR MOST OF THAT DECADE THE THREE RS HAD THE FIELD OF HOMER TRANSLATION ENTIRELY TO THEMSELVES. THEN STANLEY LOMBARDO ENTERED THE RING IN 1997 WITH HIS STREAMLINED AND BRASHLY COLLOQUIAL STYLE IN AN EDITION THAT SHOCKED THE ACADEMIC WORLD BY PUTTING ON ITS COVER A PHOTO FROM THE D-DAY INVASION. SINCE THEN THE GRAPH OF NEW ILIAD TRANSLATIONS HAS FOLLOWED A PARABOLIC CURVE. TRENDS IN PUBLISHING HAVE LED TO GREATER DIVERSITY OF MANY GREEK AND ROMAN TEXTS BUT NONE HAVE MULTIPLIED QUITE SO FAST AS THE ILIAD IN PART BECAUSE NONE ARE SO WIDELY ASSIGNED BY COLLEGE TEACHERS. AS THE CLASSICS?? SHARE OF THE CURRICULUM HAS SHRUNK HOMER HAS REMAINED THE BLUE-CHIP STOCK THAT BELONGS IN EVERY PORTFOLIO THE ONE ANCIENT AUTHOR THAT THE ENTIRE COLLEGE COMMUNITY??INCLUDING STUDENTS WHO INCREASINGLY CHALLENGE FACULTY ON THE MAKEUP OF THEIR READING LISTS??CAN AGREE IS WORTH READING. SO THE ILIAD AND TO A LESSER EXTENT THE ODYSSEY CAN BE COUNTED ON TO PRODUCE A STEADY STREAM OF REVENUE FOR PUBLISHERS EVERY TIME FALL AND SPRING TERM BOOK ORDERS COME DUE. (IT WAS REPORTED IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL THAT CAROLINE ALEXANDER??S VERSION DESPITE BEING THE ??NEW KID ON THE BLOCK? WOULD HAVE AN INITIAL PRINT RUN OF 30000 AND THAT ROBERT FAGLES?? 1990 VERSION HAS BY NOW SOLD MORE THAN A MILLION.) THE PROFIT MOTIVE MAY EXPLAIN THE SPATE OF NEW TRANSLATIONS BUT THE PROLIFERATION OF TRANSLATORS IS MORE PUZZLING. GIVEN THAT A RESPONSIBLE HELLENIST NEEDS YEARS OF LABOR TO RENDER MORE THAN 15000 LINES OF GREEK VERSE INTO PASSABLY ACCURATE EUPHONIOUS ENGLISH AND CAN EXPECT VERY LITTLE IN THE WAY OF EITHER FINANCIAL REWARD OR (IN THE RANKS OF ACADEMIA AT LEAST) PROFESSIONAL ADVANCEMENT WHENCE COMES THIS GREAT THRONG OF MEN AND NOW ONE WOMAN WHO FOLLOW IN HOMER??S TRAIL LIKE ENCHANTED CHILDREN FOLLOWING THE PIED PIPER? CAROLINE ALEXANDER IS AN INTERESTING CASE IN POINT. A RHODES SCHOLAR AND CLASSICIST TURNED JOURNALIST AND NONFICTION WRITER IN THE 1990S WITH ARTICLES IN THE NEW YORKER AND A BEST-SELLING BOOK ON SHACKLETON??S ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION SHE SEEMED TO HAVE CAST HER LOT WITH PROSE NOT POETRY AND TO HAVE LEFT THE ANCIENT GREEKS BEHIND. THEN IN 2009 CAME THE WAR THAT KILLED ACHILLES HER EXPLORATION FOR A WIDE READERSHIP OF THE MEANING OF THE ILIAD. ALEXANDER TOOK HOMERIC QUOTES FROM THE RICHMOND LATTIMORE VERSION OF 1951 BUT ALSO INCLUDED HER OWN VERSION OF A SINGLE CHAPTER OF THE POEM????NOT?? BECAUSE IT WAS FELT THAT LATTIMORE??S WORK COULD BE IMPROVED UPON? SHE WROTE ??BUT BECAUSE?? IT SEEMED AN IMPERTINENCE TO LIFT AN ENTIRE CHAPTER OF ANOTHER SCHOLAR??S WORK.? THAT TASTE OF TRANSLATION SEEMS TO HAVE CHANGED HER MIND AS TO WHETHER LATTIMORE COULD BE BETTERED FOR SHE DEVOTED MUCH OF THE NEXT FIVE YEARS TO DOING JUST THAT. EVEN MORE CURIOUS IS THE CASE OF PETER GREEN THE GREEK HISTORIAN WHO CAME OUT WITH A VERSION OF THE ILIAD THIS YEAR AT THE AGE OF 91. GREEN GOT HIS FIRST TASTE OF TRANSLATING HOMER IN THE EARLY 1950S AS PART OF A TEAM ASSEMBLED BY THE BBC TO PRODUCE A RADIO VERSION OF THE ILIAD??A TEAM THAT ALSO INCLUDED CHRISTOPHER LOGUE. BUT HE THEREAFTER DEVOTED HIS ENERGIES TO MORE SCHOLARLY ENTERPRISES PRODUCING WIDELY ADMIRED STUDIES OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT AND THE HELLENISTIC AGE. TRANSLATIONS OF WORKS BY OVID AND CATULLUS SHOWED HE ALSO HAD AN EAR FOR POETRY BUT NOTHING COULD HAVE PREDICTED THAT FOLLOWING HIS RETIREMENT FROM TEACHING HE WOULD DEVOTE THE LAST STAGE OF AN ILLUSTRIOUS CAREER TO ENGLISHING HOMER. ??FROM TIME TO TIME??NOT LEAST WHEN I SAW ANOTHER VERSION OF THE ILIAD OR THE ODYSSEY COLLECTING TRIBUTE IN THE HEADLINES??A SAD TWINGE OF REGRET?? WOULD NAG AT ME? GREEN WRITES IN HIS PREFACE. ??BUT IT WAS ONLY A YEAR AGO WHEN I REALIZED THAT ON MY NEXT BIRTHDAY I WAS GOING TO 90 THAT I ASKED MYSELF WHAT I HAD TO LOSE EVEN NOW BY TACKLING THE ILIAD.? IT??S A RARE SORT OF PERSON WHO PUTS ??TRANSLATE THE ILIAD?? ON HIS BUCKET LIST BUT GREEN REPORTS THAT HE HAS FOUND GREAT SATISFACTION IN MEETING THIS CHALLENGE AND THAT HE HAS NOW EMBARKED ON THE ODYSSEY A TASK THAT WILL SURELY TAKE HIM INTO HIS MID- IF NOT LATE NINETIES. THEN THERE??S BARRY POWELL AN EMERITUS PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN WHO BUILT HIS REPUTATION ON ACADEMIC STUDIES LIKE HOMER AND THE ORIGIN OF THE GREEK ALPHABET. AFTER AN EDITOR AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY APPROACHED POWELL ABOUT TRANSLATING HOMER INSTEAD OF ANALYZING HIM THE HOOK WAS SET. ??WHEN I TOLD MY FRIENDS ABOUT THIS PROJECT THEY SAID ??BUT HASN??T HOMER ALREADY BEEN TRANSLATED MANY TIMES??? YES SURE I TRIED TO EXPLAIN BUT NOT BY ME? SAYS POWELL IN THE PREFACE TO HIS 2014 ILIAD. ONE SUSPECTS THAT THIS MACBETH-LIKE STORY LINE??IN WHICH AN ACQUISITIONS EDITOR PLANTS THE SEED OF AMBITION IN THE MIND OF A PROMINENT SCHOLAR OFFERING A NEW AND UNDREAMED-OF FUTURE??HAS PLAYED OUT MANY TIMES AMONG THE RANKS OF RECENT TRANSLATORS. THE GENERATIONS OF MEN ARE LIKE LEAVES ON A TREE HOMER WROTE IN ILIAD BOOK 6 AND NEW VERSIONS OF HIS POEM HAVE OCCUPIED MANY LEAVES AND HAVE REQUIRED THE FELLING OF COUNTLESS TREES. THE DIVERSITY OF STYLES AND VOICES IN THE NEW PUBLISHING LANDSCAPE IS IN MANY WAYS A GOOD THING SINCE READERS??AT LEAST THOSE WILLING TO DO AN HOUR OR TWO OF RESEARCH??CAN FIND AN ILIAD THAT CLOSELY SUITS THEIR TASTES. BUT THERE ARE INEVITABLE DOWNSIDES TO A WORLD IN WHICH NEARLY ANYONE WHATEVER THEIR POETIC TALENT CAN FULFILL A LIFELONG DREAM BY GETTING THEIR VERSION OF THE ILIAD INTO PRINT. IT MIGHT SEEM HYPERBOLIC TO SAY ?EVEN MY NEIGHBOR IS DOING ONE? BUT IN MY CASE IT??S LITERALLY TRUE SINCE POET CHARLES STEIN AUTHOR OF AN ALREADY-PUBLISHED ODYSSEY NOW WELL INTO A TRANSLATION OF HOMER??S OTHER EPIC LIVES JUST DOWN MY STREET. BEFORE COMMITTING TO ANY NEW ILIAD HOWEVER READERS ARE WELL ADVISED TO CONSULT DANIEL MENDELSOHN??S 2011 NEW YORKER SQUIB COMPARING RECENT VERSIONS AND DECIDING THAT ALEXANDER POPE??S JUST NOW REACHING ITS 300TH ANNIVERSARY IS ??AT ONCE THE GRANDEST AND MOST MINUTELY DETAILED THERE IS EVER LIKELY TO BE.? SO MUCH FOR PROGRESS. ,4752.0

THE COMMERCIAL APPEALS TO THE HEART AND SOUL OF WHO WE REALLY ARE A PEOPLE MOVED MORE BY HOPE THAN HATE.

PARADE ,RAHM EMANUEL LECTURED A GROUP OF MAYORS FROM THE STAGE OF THE PRESIDENTIAL BALLROOM IN THE CAPITAL HILTON ON WEDNESDAY ON HOW TO BUILD TRUST BETWEEN COMMUNITIES AND POLICE. YES THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED. BUT THE GLITZY SURROUNDINGS AND FRIENDLY COMPANY OF THE UNITED STATES CONFERENCE OF MAYORS COULDN??T PROTECT HIM FROM POINTED CRITICISM. THAT KIND OF PROTECTION TAKES SECURITY GUARDS WHO KEPT BLACK LIVES MATTERS PROTESTERS FROM ENTERING THE HOTEL BALLROOM WHERE HE SPOKE. EMANUEL MAY HAVE ?ŸCOME TO D.C. TO ADDRESS THE GROUP OF FELLOW MAYORS BUT IN THE PROCESS HE GOT A PRESS CONFERENCE WRECKED DERAILED THE EVENT??S MESSAGING FOCUS AND REMINDED EVERYONE THAT CHICAGO NEWS IS NATIONAL NEWS -- AND THAT POLITICIANS WHO ASSOCIATE THEMSELVES WITH HIM (READ: HILLARY CLINTON) SHOULD BE VERY VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT IT. EMANUEL HAS LONG DRAWN EXCORIATING CRITICISM FROM THE CITY HE HELMS. AND LAST APRIL LONG-SHOT CHALLENGER CHUY GARCIA FORCED HIM INTO A RUNOFF BEFORE HE COULD GET RE-ELECTED AS MAYOR. MANY CHARGE THAT EMANUEL??S DEPUTIES DELIBERATELY HINDERED THE RELEASE OF VIDEO THAT SHOWED POLICE KILLING TEEN LAQUAN MCDONALD -- SHOT 16 TIMES -- TO PROTECT THE MAYOR??S REELECTION EFFORT. WHEN A JOURNALIST??S FOIA LAWSUIT GOT THE CITY TO FINALLY RELEASE THE VIDEO OF MCDONALD??S KILLING PROTESTS ROCKED THE CITY. SUBSEQUENT REPORTS HAVE PAINTED A JARRINGLY UGLY PICTURE OF CHICAGO??S MAYOR??S OFFICE AND POLICE DEPARTMENT. EMANUEL HAS HAD GOOD LUCK FINDING DEFENDERS THOUGH. AND THE MOST POWERFUL MIGHT BE HILLARY CLINTON. ON MEET THE PRESS ON JAN. 17 SHE STAUNCHLY REFUSED TO CRITICIZE THE MAYOR. ??WE??VE GOT TO DO A LOT MORE TO DEAL WITH THE SYSTEMIC RACISM AND THE PROBLEMS THAT POLICING HAS DEMONSTRATED? SHE SAID. ??MAYOR EMANUEL HAS SAID THAT HE IS COMMITTED TO COMPLETE AND TOTAL REFORM AND I THINK HE SHOULD BE HELD TO THAT STANDARD.? AND LAST MONTH SHE PRAISED EMANUEL AT AN IOWA CAMPAIGN EVENT. ??HE LOVES CHICAGO AND I??M CONFIDENT THAT HE??S GOING TO DO EVERYTHING HE CAN TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THESE ISSUES AND TAKE WHATEVER MEASURES ARE NECESSARY TO REMEDY THEM? SHE SAID. CLINTON ISN??T ALONE IN THAT CONFIDENCE AND CONFIDENCE IN RAHM BRINGS CONSEQUENCES. BALTIMORE MAYOR STEPHANIE RAWLINGS BLAKE LEARNED THAT TODAY WHEN SHE AND A GROUP OF MAYORS HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE WEDNESDAY MORNING TO OPEN THE CONFERENCE OF MAYORS WINTER MEETING THEIR MESSAGING EFFORTS ON VARIOUS BENIGN ISSUES WENT COMPLETELY OFF THE RAILS WHEN A HANDFUL OF BLACK LIVES MATTER PROTESTERS UNFURLED SIGNS SHORTLY AFTER THE MAYOR??S PRESS CONFERENCE BEGAN. ??DIVEST FROM POLICE INVEST IN BLACK COMMUNITIES? READ ONE SIGN. ANOTHER LISTED NAMES OF MEN KILLED BY BALTIMORE POLICE AND SAID ??MAYOR SRB WHO??S NEXT?? IT??S WORTH NOTING THAT REGARDLESS OF HER ASSOCIATION WITH EMANUEL RAWLINGS HAS FACED CRITICISM FROM THESE PROTESTERS. BUT THE CHICAGO MAYOR WAS THE FOCUS OF CRITICISM FROM THE PROTESTER AT THE EVENT WHO WAS LITERALLY FRONT AND CENTER. THAT WAS APRIL GOGGANS WHO STOOD IN FRONT OF THE MAYORS WITH A SIGN REFERRING TO MCDONALD??S KILLING AND CALLING FOR EMANUEL??S RESIGNATION. SECURITY DIDN??T REMOVE HER AND A VISIBLY UNCOMFORTABLE RAWLINGS BLAKE CONTINUED WITH THE PRESS CONFERENCE IN THE BACKGROUND OF HER PROTEST. THE PROTESTERS?? INVOLVEMENT FORCED THE MAYORS TO CURTAIL THEIR PRESS CONFERENCE. ??HILLARY CLINTON RAHM EMANUEL -- IT??S THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY? SAID DUANE ??SHORTY? DAVIS WHO HELD A SIGN DURING THE PRESS CONFERENCE AND SPOKE WITH REPORTERS AFTERWARDS. ??AND EVERY MAJOR BLACK CITY WHERE DEMOCRATS RUN IT IT??S LIKE PLANTATION-TYPE POLITICS.? ??NOT A HILLARY CLINTON FAN AT ALL? HE ADDED. HE ADDED THAT HE ISN??T A BERNIE SANDERS FAN EITHER. PROTESTERS WERE BLOCKED FROM ENTERING THE BALLROOM WHERE EMANUEL SPOKE. FLANKED BY RAWLINGS BLAKE AND NEW ORLEANS MAYOR MITCH LANDRIEU EMMANUEL MADE THE KIND OF COMMENTS ABOUT PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY THAT CRITICS DIRECT AT HIS OWN ADMINISTRATION. HE SAID THE CITY NEEDS TO REINFORCE POSITIVE CHOICES ITS INHABITANTS MAKE PUNISH NEGATIVE ONES AND COMMUNICATE TO CHICAGOANS THAT ??YOU DON??T GET A PASS WHEN IT COMES TO THE DECISIONS YOU MAKE.? ??THERE??S A PLACE WHERE WE COLLECTIVELY IN THE PUBLIC??S EYE CAN REINFORCE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY? HE TOLD THE AUDIENCE BOASTING ABOUT THE CITY??S PRACTICE OF HIRING PEOPLE WHO HAVE SERVED TIME FOR CRIMES TO WORK IN ITS PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. HE ALSO HAD TIPS FOR POLICE-DEPARTMENT MANAGEMENT. ??WE CAN EITHER PATROL OR BE PART OF A COMMUNITY? HE SAID. ??AND IF WE??RE PATROLLING IT YOU??RE GONNA HAVE A LIMITED IMPACT. IF YOU??RE PART OF A COMMUNITY YOU??RE GONNA BUILD THE TRUST AND COOPERATION THAT??S ESSENTIAL FOR SAFETY AND LEGITIMACY OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT.? THESE ARE BOTH EXTRAORDINARILY CURIOUS THINGS TO SAY. RAHM EMANUEL DOESN??T WANT THE PEOPLE OF CHICAGO TO ??GET A PASS? FOR THEIR BAD CHOICES AND HE WANTS MAYORS OF OTHER CITIES TO GET THEIR ACTS TOGETHER AND BUILD TRUST TO KEEP THEIR CITIES SAFE. BY THE WAY EMANUEL??S DECISION -- IN CONCORD WITH THE U.S. CONFERENCE OF MAYORS -- TO POSITION HIMSELF AS AN EXPERT ON SAFETY AND TRUST IS ESPECIALLY INTERESTING IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT VIOLENCE SHOOTINGS AND HOMICIDES ALL WENT UP IN THE WINDY CITY IN 2015. ??YOU NEVER WANT A SERIOUS CRISIS TO GO TO WASTE? EMANUEL SAID SHORTLY AFTER OBAMA WON THE 2008 ELECTION WHEN HE WAS SERVING AS HIS CHIEF OF STAFF. ??AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THINGS YOU THINK YOU COULD NOT DO BEFORE.? AND NOW THE PROTESTERS TARGETING RAHM HAVE FOUND AN OPPORTUNITY TO PUSH FOR CHANGES IN THE MIDST OF CHICAGO??S CRISIS. ,7281.0

TURKEY IS GETTING READY TO WIDEN THE REACH OF ITS MILITARY CONSIDERABLY BY BUILDING A MULTIPURPOSE AIRCRAFT CARRIER WITH ??TRANS-CONTINENTAL? CAPABILITIES. THE 225-METER SHIP DUBBED THE ANADOLU (OR ANATOLIA) SET TO ENTER SERVICE IN 2021 IS DESIGNED TO TAKE FIGHTER AIRCRAFT ATTACK HELICOPTERS TANKS TROOPS AND LANDING VESSELS TO AREAS AROUND THE MEDITERRANEAN AND AS FAR AS THE ATLANTIC AND THE INDIAN OCEANS OFFICIALS SAY. WHILE SOME ANALYSTS SAY TURKEY NEEDS A CARRIER LIKE THIS SOME REGARD THE PROJECT AS AN EXPENSIVE EXPRESSION OF PRESTIGE AND GRANDEUR THAT FAR EXCEEDS THE COUNTRY??S LIMITS. THE MOVE IS A SIGN OF NATO MEMBER TURKEY??S DETERMINATION TO BECOME A LEADING POWER IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND BEYOND AN AMBITION THAT HAS BEEN RUFFLING FEATHERS. IN A REGION SHAKEN BY THE SYRIAN WAR A HEATED ROW BETWEEN TURKEY AND NAVAL SUPERPOWER RUSSIA OVER THE DOWNING OF A FIGHTER JET AND AN INCREASED NAVAL PRESENCE BY RIVAL IRAN TO THE SOUTHEAST HAVE HEIGHTENED TENSIONS EVEN MORE. BEHLUL OZKAN AN EXPERT ON TURKISH FOREIGN POLICY AT ISTANBUL??S MARMARA UNIVERSITY SAID THE PROGRAM TO BUILD THE ANADOLU WAS IN LINE WITH PRIME MINISTER AHMET DAVUTOGLU??S IDEA OF TURKEY??S ROLE IN THE WORLD. ??HE REALLY THINKS TURKEY CAN BE AN OCEANIC POWER? OZKAN TOLD THE DAILY BEAST ADDING THAT DAVUTOGLU??S VISION MIGHT BE ??BEYOND TURKEY??S CAPABILITIES.? FOR EXAMPLE THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO SET A GOAL FOR TURKEY TO BECOME ONE OF THE WORLD??S 10 BIGGEST ECONOMIES BY 2023 A TARGET THAT MANY THINK IS HOPELESSLY OPTIMISTIC. ANKARA??S NAVAL PLANS COULD RAISE THE STAKES IN ITS TROUBLED NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE TURKEY HAS BEEN AT ODDS WITH COUNTRIES LIKE SYRIA IRAQ IRAN AND EGYPT. THAT??S IN ADDITION TO THE CONFLICT ON CYPRUS AND UNRESOLVED TERRITORIAL DISPUTES IN THE WATERS OF THE AEGEAN WITH NEIGHBOR AND NATO PARTNER GREECE. TURKEY ALREADY HAS A HIGHLY MODERN MILITARY WITH MORE THAN 600000 SOLDIERS WHO FORM THE SECOND LARGEST FORCE IN NATO WITH THE U.S. AS THE BIGGEST PARTNER. AS A FLAGSHIP OF THE TURKISH NAVY THE 28000-TON ANADOLU WITH A CAPACITY OF AS MANY AS 1400 CREW AND TROOPS WOULD BE A DEMONSTRATION ??OF THE STRENGTH REACHED BY OUR COUNTRY??S DEFENSE INDUSTRY? ORKUN KALKAVAN A MANAGER AT THE SEDEF WHARF IN ISTANBUL WHERE THE VESSEL IS BEING BUILT TOLD THE MILLIYET DAILY THIS WEEK. THE CONTRACT TO BUILD THE SHIP WAS SIGNED LAST YEAR WITH THE SPANISH COMPANY NAVANTIA AS A TECHNOLOGICAL PARTNER. KALKAVAN SAID THE ANADOLU EXPECTED TO COST MORE THAN $1 BILLION WOULD BE EQUIPPED FOR ??TRANS-CONTINENTAL TASKS.? ANALYSTS DESCRIBE THE CARRIER AS A LANDING PLATFORM DOCK OR AN LPD WHICH IS A WARSHIP USED TO CARRY TROOPS TO FLASHPOINTS AND SEND THEM ASHORE WITH THE HELP OF ON-BOARD LANDING VESSELS OR A LANDING HELICOPTER DOCK (LHD). THE VESSEL WILL COME WITH ITS OWN SMALL FLEET OF F-35 FIGHTER JETS AND HELICOPTERS A HOSPITAL WITH AT LEAST 30 BEDS AND ROOM FOR LANDING BOATS AND OTHER SMALLER CRAFTS AS WELL AS FOR 13 BATTLE TANKS. DEVRIM YAYLALI AN EXPERT ON THE TURKISH NAVY WHO WRITES A BLOG ON NAVAL MATTERS SAID PLANNING FOR THE SHIP STARTED AS FAR BACK AS 2006. ??LARGE AMPHIBIOUS SHIPS ARE THE ONLY REAL MULTIPURPOSE SHIPS ANY NAVY CAN POSSESS AND ARE THE NAVAL EQUIVALENT OF SWISS ARMY KNIVES? YAYLALI EMAILED IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS BY THE DAILY BEAST. SHIPS LIKE THE ANADOLU COULD BE USED FOR FORCE PROJECTION????THE MOST OBVIOUS USE.? THE SHIP COULD BE DEPLOYED AS A ??MOTHER SHIP FOR SMALL BOAT OPERATIONS AND HELICOPTERS? HE ADDED. WITH THESE NEW FEATURES TURKEY??S MILITARY POWER WOULD GROW DRAMATICALLY. BUT THE ANADOLU COULD ALSO HELP DELIVER HUMANITARIAN AID DURING A CRISIS OR AFTER A DISASTER AND COULD BE USED FOR THE ??EVACUATION OF COMBATANTS AND NON-COMBATANTS? YAYLALI WROTE ADDING THAT THE ??TURKISH NAVY REALLY NEEDS THESE CAPABILITIES.? HE POINTED TO AN INCIDENT IN 2011 WHEN TURKEY EVACUATED MORE THAN 23000 CIVILIANS FROM LIBYA AND NEEDED MANY COMMERCIAL PLANES TO DO IT. WITH A SHIP LIKE THE ANADOLU THE OPERATION WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH QUICKER AND EASIER HE WROTE. THE COMBINATION OF MILITARY AND CIVILIAN USES COULD PAY OFF FOR ANKARA IN THE FUTURE OTHER ANALYSTS AGREE. ??CAPABILITIES OFFERED BY THE LPD WILL MAKE IT AN IMPORTANT INSTRUMENT OF FOREIGN POLICY THAT WILL ACCENTUATE TURKEY??S SOFT POWER BEYOND ITS MILITARY PROWESS? METIN GURCAN AN INDEPENDENT SECURITY ANALYST AND COLUMNIST FOR AL-MONITOR TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. MARMARA??S OZKAN SAID ONE OTHER POSSIBLE USE FOR THE ANADOLU COULD LIE IN DEPLOYMENTS IN CRISIS SPOTS AROUND THE MIDDLE EAST WHERE TURKEY??S PARTNERS IN EUROPE AND THE U.S. WERE RELUCTANT TO INTERVENE THEMSELVES BECAUSE OF ANTI-WESTERN SENTIMENTS. ??MAYBE THE SHIP COULD BE DEPLOYED IN NATO OPERATIONS THERE BECAUSE ACTION BY TURKEY AS A MUSLIM COUNTRY WOULD BE EASIER TO JUSTIFY? HE SAID.

1427,10449153.0,2016-01-31T05:01:00+00:00,WHY ISRAEL COULDN??T SAVE PRIME MINISTER RABIN,A TOXIC AND INFLAMMATORY POLITICAL ATMOSPHERE. AN ASSASSINATION. A RUMORED CONSPIRACY AND COVER-UP. THE 1995 MURDER OF ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER YITZHAK RABIN BY A RIGHT-WING FANATIC BEARS MORE THAN A PASSING RESEMBLANCE TO JFK IN DALLAS EXCEPT FOR THIS??RABIN??S MURDER HAD MORE FAR-REACHING CONSEQUENCES AND ITS EFFECTS CAN STILL BE SEEN ON ISRAELI AND MIDDLE EASTERN POLITICS. THAT AT LEAST IS ONE OF THE TAKEAWAYS FROM RABIN THE LAST DAY DIRECTOR AMOS GITAI??S FILM ABOUT THE PRIME MINISTER??S ASSASSINATION THE EVENTS SURROUNDING IT AND THE COMMISSION SET UP TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED AND WHY. THE PICTURE WHICH OPENS THIS WEEKEND IN NEW YORK FOLLOWED BY A NATIONAL ROLLOUT FEATURES A COMBINATION OF ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE AND RECREATIONS THAT HELP ILLUMINATE NOT ONLY WHAT OCCURRED ON NOVEMBER 4 1995 BUT HOW THOSE EVENTS GAVE A PUSH TO THE REACTIONARY SETTLER MOVEMENT. IT ALSO EXPLAINS THE RISE OF CURRENT ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU. ??RABIN WAS KILLED BY THE ISRAEL EXTREME RIGHT WHO WANTED TO DESTABILIZE HIS GOVERNMENT? SAYS GITAI WHO SPOKE TO THE DAILY BEAST DURING A NEW YORK PUBLICITY TOUR. ??HE WAS THE VICTIM OF A CRAZY COALITION??YOU HAD HALLUCINATING RABBIS WHO CAME UP WITH ANCIENT CURSES THE STRONG LOBBY OF THE SETTLERS AND THE PARLIAMENTARY RIGHT. WE CANNOT SAY THEY ALL WANTED TO KILL HIM BUT THEY DID WANT TO WEAKEN HIM.? RABIN??S ??CRIME?? IN THE EYES OF THESE GROUPS WAS HIS 1993 SIGNING OF THE OSLO ACCORDS A SERIES OF AGREEMENTS WITH YASIR ARAFAT??S PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANIZATION. THESE AGREEMENTS FOR WHICH RABIN ARAFAT AND ISRAELI FOREIGN MINISTER SHIMON PERES WON THE 1994 NOBEL PEACE PRIZE PROVIDED FOR AN INTERIM PALESTINIAN GOVERNMENT THAT WOULD ADMINISTER AREAS UNDER ITS CONTROL AND CALLED FOR THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCE FROM PARTS OF GAZA AND THE WEST BANK. THE PLO ALSO RECOGNIZED THE STATE OF ISRAEL AND ISRAEL RECOGNIZED THE PLO AS REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE. RABIN HAD ALREADY FROZEN SETTLEMENT CONSTRUCTION WHICH ACCORDING TO THE FILM HAD GROWN FROM 31 SETTLEMENTS AND 4400 SETTLERS IN 1977 TO 120 SETTLEMENTS AND 100000 SETTLERS IN 1992. THIS GROWTH HAD OCCURRED EVEN THOUGH THE SETTLEMENTS WERE CONSIDERED ILLEGAL UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW A VIOLATION OF THE GENEVA CONVENTION CONCERNING CIVILIAN RIGHTS. NOT THAT THIS MATTERED TO THE EXTREME RIGHT IN ISRAEL WHO SAW THEIR COUNTRY??S VICTORY IN THE 1967 WAR??AFTER WHICH ISRAEL ANNEXED GAZA THE SINAI PENINSULA THE GOLAN HEIGHTS AND THE WEST BANK??AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALIZE THEIR DREAM OF A GREATER ISRAEL. SO THE ACCORDS WERE VIEWED AS A TRAITOROUS ENTERPRISE WITH REACTIONARY RABBIS CLAIMING THEY VIOLATED THE TORAH BY PUTTING JEWISH LIVES AT RISK. THIS MINDSET LED AT LEAST ONE RABBI TO COMPARE THE RABIN GOVERNMENT TO THE NAZIS AND SOME RABBIS PLACED A PULSA DINURA AN ANCIENT CURSE ON RABIN FOLLOWED UP BY A DIN RODEF AN ANCIENT JEWISH LAW WHICH ALLOWED FOR EXTRAJUDICIAL KILLINGS. INFLUENCED BY ALL THIS AND A LEGAL SYSTEM WHICH REFUSED TO BRING CHARGES AGAINST THE SEDITIOUS STATEMENTS COMING FROM THE RIGHT WING A 25-YEAR OLD LAW STUDENT NAMED YIGAL AMIR SHOT AND KILLED RABIN FOLLOWING A MASSIVE TEL AVIV RALLY HELD TO ENLIST SUPPORT FOR THE ACCORDS. MUCH OF RABIN THE LAST DAY DETAILS THE ENSUING INVESTIGATION BY THE SHAMGAR COMMISSION WHICH WAS SET UP TO INVESTIGATE THE ASSASSINATION. USING THE COMMISSION??S OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPTS GITAI??S FILM FEATURES RECREATIONS OF INTERVIEWS WITH RABIN??S DRIVER AND VARIOUS SECURITY PERSONNEL. THE PICTURE THAT EMERGES IS OF A SECURITY FORCE THAT WAS UTTERLY INCOMPETENT OR SERIOUSLY COMPROMISED. THE AREA WHERE THE ACTUAL SHOOTING OCCURRED WAS LIGHTLY PATROLLED ALLOWING AMIR TO GO UNNOTICED FOR NEARLY 40 MINUTES. AFTER THE SHOOTING IT TOOK THE CAR CARRYING RABIN??S STILL BREATHING BODY EIGHT MINUTES TO DRIVE THE 500 YARDS TO THE NEAREST HOSPITAL SINCE NO ONE HAD SCHOOLED THE DRIVER ON AN ESCAPE ROUTE AND NO ONE CALLED THE HOSPITAL TO INFORM IT OF THE EMERGENCY WHICH MEANT NO MEDICAL PERSONNEL WERE WAITING WHEN THE VEHICLE FINALLY ARRIVED. GITAI SAYS HE IS ??NOT SURE THERE WAS ANY CONSPIRACY? THAT ??IT??S JUST THE ISRAELI CHAOS A MIXTURE OF VOLUNTARY THINGS AND JUST NEGLIGENCE. IT??S A SEQUENCE OF PROBLEMATIC SIGNALS. AT LEAST POLITICALLY THEY SAW ALL THE SIGNS [THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD HAPPEN]. BUT I CHOSE TO GIVE ALL THE INGREDIENTS AND LET EVERYBODY MAKE THEIR OWN INTERPRETATION.? AMIR WHO IS CONSIDERED A HERO BY THE RADICAL RIGHT WAS SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON. THE REAL BENEFICIARY OF THE ASSASSINATION TURNED OUT TO BE NETANYAHU WHO WAS THE LEADER OF THE RIGHT-WING LIKUD PARTY AT THE TIME OF THE SHOOTING AND WAS ELECTED PRIME MINISTER IN 1996. HE IS SHOWN IN ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE GIVING IMPASSIONED ULTRA-NATIONALISTIC SPEECHES AND IN ONE CHILLING SHOT SMIRKING IN A CORNER WHILE REACTIONARY ISRAELI POLITICIANS KEEP INTERRUPTING A SPEECH RABIN IS TRYING TO GIVE BEFORE THE COUNTRY??S PARLIAMENT. ??NETANYAHU IS A CYNICAL GUY? SAYS GITAI ??SO YOU HAVE A CONFRONTATION BETWEEN SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO RECONCILE ISRAEL WITH THE REGION AND SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO GET POWER BACK TO THE RIGHT WING. IT??S A GENERAL STRATEGY UP UNTIL TODAY.? ALTHOUGH THE FILM RAISES THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT RABIN WAS NA??VE ABOUT THE STRENGTH OF THE FORCES ARRAYED AGAINST HIM GITAI SAYS OF THE FORMER LEADER THAT ??YOU HAVE TO BE DETERMINED NOT NA??VE BUT ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT PEACE IS ABOUT A DIALOGUE. SO WHEN YOU MAKE PEACE IT CANNOT BE UNILATERAL THE ??OTHER?? SHOULD EXIST. AND THIS IS THE BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW THE OTHERS DON??T EXIST IT??S THEM [ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS] AND THEIR CULTURE.? WITH GRASSROOTS PALESTINIAN VIOLENCE AGAINST ISRAELIS ON THE RISE AND SETTLER VS. PALESTINIAN VIOLENCE BECOMING AN INCREASING PROBLEM GITAI IS NOT OVERLY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE. ??IF IT WILL CONTINUE THIS WAY IT WILL BE SELF-DESTRUCTION? HE SAYS. ??NETANYAHU IS TALENTED BUT CYNICAL AND HE IS USING HATRED BETWEEN SUB-GROUPS??JEWS VS. ARABS RELIGIOUS VS. NON-RELIGIOUS??TO GET ELECTED. THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS IN A COUNTRY THAT IS SO FRAGILE.? ULTIMATELY GITAI FEELS HIS FILM SHOWS THAT RABIN??S ASSASSINATION WAS A HISTORICAL TRAGEDY NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT SET BACK THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS BUT BECAUSE IN THE INTERVENING YEARS NO ISRAELI POLITICIAN HAS COME ALONG TO REPLACE HIM. ??EVERY YEAR MORE THAN 100000 PEOPLE GO TO RABIN SQUARE [SITE OF THE KILLING] TO MARK THE DAY OF HIS ASSASSINATION? HE SAYS. ??I THINK THE ONLY POLITICAL FIGURE ALARMING TO NETANYAHU IS THIS DEAD MAN. I DON??T THINK THERE ARE ANY LIVING ONES.? ,5172.0

ON THE WORLD DIED ON JANUARY 4 AT 81. MEMORY LANE TIME. I MET STIGWOOD IN LONDON AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 1970S WHEN HE AND MICHAEL WHITE A BRITISH HYPERACTIVE THEATER PRODUCER WERE BRINGING OH CALCUTTA! TO LONDON AFTER A RUN OFF BROADWAY. OH CALCUTTA! WAS A MUSICAL REVUE WHICH FOCUSED ON SEX AND COMBINED NUDITY AND THINKIER STUFF BEING BUILT FROM SKETCHES WRITTEN BY AMONGST OTHERS SAMUEL BECKETT. SO AS WAS THE WAY OF THE TIME IT WAS PORNY BUT RADICAL AND WAS NATURALLY THE HOTTEST OF HOT TICKETS. MICHAEL WHITE WAS A FRIEND. I WENT TO THE OPENING AND TO THE PARTY WHICH WAS IN STIGWOOD??S FAUX BARONIAL MANSION POSHED UP WITH OLD MASTER-ISH PAINTINGS AND STUFFED ANIMAL HEADS. IT WAS HAUTE POP AT ITS HAUTEST. STIGWOOD WAS AMBITIOUS AND HAD A STREAK OF DISRUPTIVE BRILLIANCE. IT WAS HE WHO AT ERIC CLAPTON??S URGING PLUCKED JACK BRUCE GINGER BAKER AND ERIC CLAPTON FROM TWO GROUPS HE MANAGED PUT TOGETHER CREAM AND SENT THEM OUT TO THE STATES TO OPEN FOR THE WHO. CREAM SWIFTLY BECAME WHAT HAS BEEN CALLED THE WORLD??S FIRST SUPERGROUP AND ERIC CLAPTON IS GOD SPROUTED ON WALLS ALL OVER LONDON. AND MY KING??S ROAD NEIGHBOR MARTIN SHARP WHO WAS RENTING CLAPTON??S STUDIO DESIGNED TWO OF THEIR ALBUM COVERS. HOW TINY LONDON WAS THEN! SOON STIGWOOD AN EARLY MAESTRO OF WHAT HAS BECOME OUR SIMMERING HIGH/LOW CULTURAL MELT MORPHED INTO MOVIES. JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR WAS HIS FIRST AND IT WAS FOLLOWED BY TOMMY WHICH WAS BASED ON A WHO ALBUM AND CAME OUT IN 1975. IN HOLLYWOOD STIGWOOD WAS SEEN AS HAVING A MIDAS TOUCH. THE FOLLOWING YEAR I WAS IN NEW YORK WORKING AT NEW YORK MAGAZINE. THERE STIGWOOD WAS VERY MUCH ON THE RADAR. TRIBAL RITES OF THE NEW SATURDAY NIGHT A STORY BY NIK COHN WHO HAD COME OVER FROM THE UK AT ROUGHLY THE SAME TIME HAD BEEN ON THE COVER. STIGWOOD HAD BOUGHT THE RIGHTS AND IT WAS NOW IN PRODUCTION (IT WOULD BECOME SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER). AS WAS HIS ROCK-AND-ROLL MOVIE GREASE. AND HE WAS PUTTING TOGETHER ANOTHER AMBITIOUS MOVIE SERGEANT PEPPER??S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND BASED ON YOU-KNOW-WHAT AND STARRING PETER FRAMPTON AND THE BEE GEES. THERE WERE IRONIES ABOUT THE SERGEANT PEPPER PROJECT. IN 1967 STIGWOOD HAD BECOME FRIENDLY WITH BRIAN EPSTEIN THE BEATLES MANAGER AND HAD ACQUIRED A MINORITY POSITION IN NEMS WHICH CONTROLLED THE BEATLES?? RIGHTS THEREBY BECOMING CO-MANAGING DIRECTOR. AND HEIR IN WAITING.?Ÿ ??BRIAN WANTED TO RETIRE TO SPAIN? STIGWOOD TOLD ME. ??HE GAVE ME THE OPTION TO ACQUIRE CONTROL FOR??I THINK IT WAS HALF A MILLION.? BRIAN EPSTEIN OD??D A YEAR LATER. STIGWOOD TRIED TO FOLLOW THROUGH AND POLYGRAM CAME UP WITH THE MOOLAH. BUT THERE WAS A PROBLEM. ??HE HADN??T TOLD THE BEATLES ABOUT IT? STIGWOOD SAID. ADDING ??I THINK THAT THEY WERE QUITE SURPRISED.? RIGHT. PAUL MCCARTNEY LATER TOLD GREIL MARCUS THE REACTION OF THE GROUP: ??WE SAID ??IN FACT IF YOU DO IF YOU SOMEHOW MANAGE TO PULL THIS OFF WE CAN PROMISE YOU ONE THING. WE WILL RECORD ??GOD SAVE THE QUEEN?? FOR EVERY SINGLE RECORD WE MAKE FROM NOW ON AND WE??LL SING IT OUT OF TUNE. THAT??S A PROMISE. SO IF THIS GUY BUYS US THAT??S WHAT HE??S BUYING.??? SO THAT WAS A NO GO. BUT STIGWOOD HAD SIMPLY MOVED ON LAUNCHING HIS OWN COMPANY RSO FOR ROBERT STIGWOOD ORGANISATION. AND HE HAD SIGNED THREE YOUNG AUSTRALIANS THE GIBB BROTHERS WHILE HE WAS AT NEMS. THE BEE GEES. THEY WERE SOON TOPPING THE CHARTS. THE PREMIERE OF SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER ON DECEMBER 16 1978 WAS FOLLOWED BY A DINNER AT THE TAVERN ON THE GREEN AFTER WHICH ALL MOVED ON TO A RECENTLY OPENED DISCOTHEQUE STUDIO 54. THE MOVIE WAS A HUGE HUGE HIT AND PLAYED A MIGHTY PART IN THE BUDDING DISCOMANIA. IT MADE STIGWOOD $100 MILLION AND THE SOUNDTRACK SOLD ABOVE TWENTY MILLION DOUBLE ALBUMS. THE WANNA-BE OVERLORD OF THE BEATLES WAS ON TOP ANYWAY. THEN SERGEANT PEPPER??S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND CAME OUT. IT WAS CRITICALLY EVISCERATED BY ALL AND DIED. SOON RSO TOO WAS HISTORY. THERE HAVE BEEN CURIOUS ELEMENTS IN THE TRAJECTORY OF THE PHENOMENON SINCE. NIK COHN WOULD UNBURDEN HIMSELF TO THE BRIT PAPER THE GUARDIAN IN 1994 TO THE EFFECT THAT ??TONY MANERO? THE DISCO FIGURE AROUND WHOM HE HAD BUILT HIS PIECE HAD BEEN A MYTH LITERALLY BEING BASED ON A STREET-WISE SCENESTER HE HAD KNOWN IN LONDON??S SHEPHERD??S BUSH IN THE ??60S. AS FOR ROBERT STIGWOOD HE WOULD MAKE FURTHER MOVES FROM TIME TO TIME BUT HIS TOUCH WAS GONE. HE DIED AT A HUGE HOUSE ON THE ISLE OF WIGHT JUST OFF BRITAIN??S SOUTH COAST ATTENDED ONE HEARS ONLY BY A RETINUE OF STAFF. BACK WHEN I WAS WRITING MY MAGAZINE PIECE I WAS STRUCK BY THE EXTENT TO WHICH TALENTED PEOPLE DISAGREED ABOUT HIM.

ACCORDING TO AN UPDATE FROM THE U.S. NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER EARLY THURSDAY AFTERNOON ALEX HAS SUSTAINED WINDS OF 85 MPH MAKING IT THE STRONGEST ATLANTIC HURRICANE EVER RECORDED IN JANUARY. THE NHC ALSO STATED THAT THE STORM IS ABOUT 400 MILES SOUTH OF THE AZORES WITH HURRICANE-FORCE WINDS DANGEROUS STORM SURGE AND UP TO SEVEN INCHES OF RAIN EXPECTED TO IMPACT THE ISLANDS FRIDAY. A HURRICANE WARNING IS IN EFFECT FOR THE CENTRAL AZORES AND A TROPICAL STORM WARNING IS IN EFFECT FOR THE EASTERN ISLANDS. WHILE NOT UNPRECEDENTED HURRICANES IN THE ATLANTIC IN JANUARY ARE EXTREMELY RARE??ALEX IS THE FIRST HURRICANE TO FORM IN THE ATLANTIC IN JANUARY SINCE 1938. THE ONLY OTHER JANUARY HURRICANE ON RECORD IN THE ATLANTIC IS HURRICANE ALICE WHICH FORMED IN DECEMBER OF 1954 AND CONTINUED INTO JANUARY OF 1955. CLARK EVANS A PROFESSOR AT THE?ŸUNIVERSITY?ŸOF?ŸWISCONSIN-MILWAUKEE STUDIES TROPICAL CYCLONES. ACCORDING TO EVANS HURRICANES ARE PARTICULARLY RARE THIS?ŸTIME?ŸOF?ŸYEAR?ŸBECAUSE?ŸTHE CONDITIONS?ŸIN?ŸWHICH THEY TYPICALLY?ŸFORM INCLUDING WARM?ŸWATERS?ŸLOW?ŸVERTICAL?ŸWIND?ŸSHEAR AND ABUNDANT?ŸMOISTURE ARE?ŸABSENT. ALEX WAS ABLE TO FORM IN PART BECAUSE OF AN AREA WITH RELATIVELY LOW VERTICAL WIND SHEAR FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. HURRICANES NEED TO BUILD VERTICALLY AS THEY FORM AND IF WIND SHEAR WHICH IS THE CHANGE IN WIND DIRECTION AND SPEED WITH HEIGHT IS HIGH IT??S MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE VERTICAL FORMATION TO OCCUR. AS FOR THE WARM WATERS NEEDED FOR HURRICANE DEVELOPMENT ??SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES NEAR ALEX ARE RUNNING ABOUT 1?§C ABOVE NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR??BUT STILL?ŸMUCH LOWER THAN NORMALLY SEEN WITH DEVELOPING HURRICANE? SAID EVANS. RELATIVELY COLD TEMPERATURES HIGHER IN THE ATMOSPHERE HOWEVER ??ALLOWED FOR THE STORM TO MAKE RELATIVELY EFFICIENT USE OF WHAT ENERGY IT COULD EXTRACT FROM THE UNDERLYING OCEAN.? THE LOCATION OF ALEX??S FORMATION IS ALSO RARE FOR ANY TIME OF THE YEAR. ERIC BLAKE A HURRICANE SPECIALIST AT NHC TWEETED TODAY THAT THIS IS ONLY THE SECOND HURRICANE TO EVER FORM NORTH OF 30?§N AND EAST OF 70?§W. ATTRIBUTING EXTREME EVENTS LIKE HURRICANE ALEX TO CLIMATE CHANGE EL NI?ÑO OR ANOTHER SOURCE OF CLIMATE VARIABILITY IS A MAJOR RESEARCH AREA FOR SCIENTISTS. THOUGH MANY MIGHT ASSUME CLIMATE CHANGE A LIKELY CULPRIT FOR JANUARY HURRICANES DENNIS?ŸFELTGEN?ŸSPOKESPERSON?ŸFOR?ŸTHE?ŸNHC POINTED OUT VIA EMAIL THAT THOUGH SPORADIC TROPICAL STORMS AND HURRICANES FORMED IN THE ATLANTIC THIS TIME OF YEAR THROUGHOUT THE 20TH CENTURY. AND WHILE WATER TEMPERATURES IN THE AREA AROUND ALEX ARE ABOVE AVERAGE ACCORDING TO EVANS SIMILAR CONDITIONS DURING JANUARY IN 1997 AND 2004 AND DID NOT PRODUCE A TROPICAL STORM. SCIENTISTS ARE ALSO STUDYING HOW WARMING WATERS AND CLIMATE CHANGE MAY INFLUENCE LONG-TERM TRENDS IN HURRICANE FORMATION AND STRENGTH. EVANS IS A CO-AUTHOR ON A PAPER OUT THIS MONTH IN THE JOURNAL OF CLIMATE THAT FOUND NO MEANINGFUL LONG-TERM TREND IN ATLANTIC HURRICANE SEASON LENGTH OVER THE PERIOD 1979-2014. EVANS SAID THAT VARIABILITY ON SHORTER TIME SCALES APPEARS TO INFLUENCE SEASON LENGTH MORE THAN ANY LONGER-TERM INFLUENCE. WHILE THE STUDY LOOKED AT CONDITIONS THAT MAY EXTEND SEASON LENGTH THEY DID SO FOR THE MONTHS IMMEDIATELY BORDERING HURRICANE SEASON (MAY/JUNE AND OCTOBER/NOVEMBER) NOT FOR CONDITIONS IN JANUARY. BECAUSE THERE ARE SO FEW STORMS THIS TIME OF YEAR LITTLE DATA EXISTS WITH WHICH TO DO RIGOROUS SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS. WHEN ASKED WHETHER ALEX MIGHT BE AN EXTENSION OF THE HURRICANE SEASON THAT TECHNICALLY ENDED NOVEMBER 30 OR AN EARLY START TO THE 2016 SEASON BEGINNING JUNE 1 EVANS SAID ??I WOULD NOT CLASSIFY IT AS EITHER. I THINK ALEX IS AN OUTLIER MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE.? ,4801.0

AFTER SAUDI ARABIA??S RECENT EXECUTION OF A LEADING SHIITE MUSLIM CLERIC SHEIKH NIMR AL-NIMR THERE WAS WIDESPREAD OUTRAGE IN SHIITE MUSLIM COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST AND ESPECIALLY IN IRAQ. PROTESTS WERE ORGANIZED IN BAGHDAD FED BY SOCIAL MEDIA. ONE VIDEO WAS SHARED THAT ALLEGEDLY SHOWED THE LAST SECONDS OF NIMR??S LIFE AND HIS EXECUTION. ANOTHER WIDELY SHARED VIDEO SHOWED NIMR??S BODY BEING DROPPED OUT OF A HELICOPTER AFTER THE EXECUTION. SOME IRAQIS EVEN SAID HE WAS THROWN OUT OF THAT HELICOPTER WHILE STILL ALIVE. THIS KIND OF ??NEWS? IS COMMON ON IRAQI SOCIAL MEDIA. AND IT??S DANGEROUS BECAUSE FOR MANY IRAQIS SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITES LIKE FACEBOOK TWITTER YOUTUBE AND TO A LESSER DEGREE INSTAGRAM HAVE BECOME A MAJOR SOURCE OF POLITICAL AND SECURITY-RELATED NEWS. THEY DO NOT TRUST MAINSTREAM MEDIA IN IRAQ WHICH IS MOSTLY CONSIDERED TO BE PARTISAN WITH MUCH OF IT FUNDED BY POLITICAL PARTIES RELIGIOUS BODIES OR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS PUSHING THEIR OWN AGENDA. MANY IRAQIS SAY THEIR MOST TRUSTED SOURCE OF NEWS IS WORD-OF-MOUTH??RELATIVES FRIENDS NEIGHBORS??SO IT MAKES SENSE THAT THEY WOULD TURN TO SOCIAL MEDIA BASICALLY AN EXPANDED WORD-OF-MOUTH NETWORK TO GET INFORMATION THEY BELIEVE THEY CAN TRUST. HOWEVER ONCE AGAIN THE COUNTRY??S INGRAINED SOCIAL DIVISIONS ARE PLAYING A PART ON SOCIAL MEDIA SITES TOO. MANIPULATED VIDEOS PHOTOSHOPPED PICTURES AND OTHER FALSE NEWS AND DISTURBING RUMORS ARE SHARED CONTINUOUSLY BY IRAQIS CRAVING INFORMATION AND IN SOME CASES ANYTHING THAT CONFIRMS THEIR OWN BIAS. THE STORY ABOUT SHEIKH NIMR??S EXECUTION WAS A PRIME EXAMPLE OF THIS. IT??S HARD TO KNOW WHO POSTED THE VIDEOS ORIGINALLY BUT IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT THE ORIGINAL USER HAD AN AGENDA. UNDER THE GUIDANCE OPEN SOURCE VERIFICATION EXPERTS AT THE INVESTIGATIVE NETWORK BELLINGCAT A TEAM OF BLOGGERS FROM THE IRAQI NETWORK FOR SOCIAL MEDIA WHO ARE ALSO THE FOUNDERS OF A FACEBOOK PAGE CALLED?ŸFAKE POSTS AND JOURNALISTS FROM NIQASH TOOK A CLOSER LOOK AT SOME OF THESE FALSIFIED REPORTS ON SOCIAL MEDIA. USING OPEN SOURCE VERIFICATION TECHNIQUES LIKE GEOLOCATION AND REVERSE IMAGE SEARCH THE TEAM QUICKLY FOUND THAT THE FIRST VIDEO THE ONE ALLEGEDLY SHOWING AL-NIMR??S EXECUTION HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SAUDI CLERIC. THE CLIP WATCHED BY THOUSANDS OF IRAQIS WAS ACTUALLY THE VIDEO OF THE EXECUTION OF AN INDONESIAN MAID IN SAUDI ARABIA AND IT WAS FOUR YEARS OLD. THE?ŸOTHER VIDEO?ŸTHAT SUPPOSEDLY SHOWED AL-NIMR??S BODY BEING THROWN OUT OF A HELICOPTER AFTER HIS EXECUTION WAS ALSO SOMETHING ELSE:?ŸIT WAS A VIDEO?ŸSHOWING A MEMBER OF SAUDI POLICE FORCE FALLING OUT OF A HELICOPTER MOST LIKELY TO HIS DEATH IN 2013. THE INVESTIGATORS THEN WENT ON TO LOOK AT SEVERAL OTHER POPULAR RUMORS DOING THE ROUNDS OF IRAQI SOCIAL MEDIA. ANOTHER PICTURE THAT CAUSED A DIFFERENT KIND OF UPROAR WAS THAT OF A BLOODIED SOLDIER WITH THE REMAINS OF A MORTAR EMBEDDED IN HIS ARM ALIVE AND SITTING ON A BED. INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH EVERY SINGLE GROUP FIGHTING IN IRAQ WANTED TO CLAIM THIS ??HERO? AS ONE OF THEIR OWN. THE IRAQI KURDISH MILITARY KNOWN AS THE PESHMERGA SAID HE WAS ONE OF THEIR MEN. THE IRAQI ARMY CLAIMED HIM AS THEIR SOLDIER AND THEN THE SHIITE MUSLIM VOLUNTEER MILITIAS WHO MAY OR MAY NOT FIGHT ALONGSIDE THE IRAQI ARMY SAID HE WAS ONE OF THEIR BRAVE VOLUNTEERS. EVEN THE EXTREMIST ISLAMIC STATE OR ISIS GOT IN ON THE ACT SAYING HE WAS ACTUALLY ONE OF THEIR FIGHTERS. PEOPLE IN IRAQ WANT TO BELIEVE THIS KIND OF STORY AND THEY GAVE THE SOLDIER WITH THE MORTAR IN HIS ARM NICKNAMES LIKE ??IRON MAN? IN HONOR OF HIS SURVIVAL. BUT ONCE AGAIN IT TURNED OUT THAT NOTHING ABOUT THIS PICTURE WAS CORRECT: THE MAN WAS IN FACT A SOLDIER IN THE COLOMBIAN ARMY IN SOUTH AMERICA. THE PICTURE DATED BACK TO 2000 AND THE MAN HAD BEEN INJURED WHILE THE COLOMBIAN ARMY WAS FIGHTING LOCAL LEFT WING REBELS THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA (FARC). DETAILS ON THE REMAINS OF THE MORTAR IN THE MAN??S ARM WORDS ON HIS BADGE SAYING QUIMBAYA HIS MILITARY RANK AND?ŸOTHER NEWS REPORTS?ŸON THE INCIDENT QUICKLY MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE SOLDIER HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IRAQ AT ALL. ANOTHER CONTROVERSY WAS CAUSED BY A PICTURE THAT SEEMED TO SHOW AN OFFICER FROM THE IRAQI KURDISH MILITARY CONSORTING WITH MEMBERS OF THE ISIS GROUP A FORCE THAT THE IRAQI KURDISH ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FIGHTING. BACK IN 2014 WHEN ISIS FIRST TOOK OVER THE NORTHERN CITY OF MOSUL THERE WERE ALREADY RUMORS THAT THE IRAQI KURDISH WERE COOPERATING WITH THE GROUP IN ORDER TO GAIN ADVANTAGE AND MOVE TOWARD A LONG-CHERISHED GOAL OF KURDISH INDEPENDENCE. NO BIG SURPRISE THEN THAT THIS PICTURE OF SUPPOSED ENEMIES TOGETHER RELAUNCHED THOSE RUMORS IN THE ECHO CHAMBER THAT IS IRAQI SOCIAL MEDIA. ONCE AGAIN THOUGH THIS WAS MISINFORMATION. THE INDIVIDUAL WHO LOOKED LIKE HE WAS A MEMBER OF ISIS??SPORTING A LONG BEARD AND A TYPICAL LONG-SHIRTED ISIS OUTFIT??TURNED OUT TO BE AN ACTOR WELL KNOWN IN IRAQI KURDISTAN BUT NOT BY ARAB AUDIENCES IN IRAQ. HE WAS IN AN AREA WEST OF MOSUL WORKING ON A FILM ABOUT HOW ISIS HAD ATTACKED THE YAZIDI MINORITY IN NORTHERN IRAQ. AND THE MEMBER OF THE IRAQI KURDISH MILITARY PICTURED WITH THE ACTOR WAS A REAL SOLDIER A MEMBER OF THE SECURITY TASK FORCE ASSIGNED TO PROTECT THE FILM CREW AND ACTORS. IT SEEMED THAT?ŸTHE PICTURE HAD BEEN TAKEN AS A KIND OF CELEBRITY SOUVENIR?ŸAND UPLOADED IN THAT VEIN BUT HAD THEN BEEN TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT BY THOSE WHO DIDN??T RECOGNIZE THE KURDISH ACTOR AND WHO HAD SUSPICIONS ABOUT THE IRAQI KURDISH MILITARY. IT IS NOT JUST ORDINARY IRAQIS ON SOCIAL MEDIA SPREADING RUMORS AND GOSSIP. THE IRAQI MEDIA ALSO DISSEMINATES THESE KINDS OF STORIES TO INCREASE AUDIENCE SHARE AND GET MORE VISITORS TO THEIR SITES. THEY KNOW THESE CONTROVERSIAL REPORTS WILL DO THAT. FOR SOME OF THE LESS SCRUPULOUS MORE PARTISAN MEDIA OUTLETS THE FALSE STORIES MAY ALSO SUPPORT THEIR ORGANIZATION??S AGENDA. DIGITAL CONTENT THAT SETS ONE SECT OR ETHNIC GROUP AGAINST ANOTHER IN IRAQ IS SEEN AS POPULAR A BIT LIKE THE POPULIST MUCK RAKING DONE BY TABLOIDS IN THE WEST IT OFTEN SPREADS VERY QUICKLY?? WHICH MAKES EVEN MORE PROFESSIONAL NEWS OUTLETS WANT TO RE-PUBLISH OR COMMENT ON IT. ??THE BEST WAY TO CONFRONT THIS KIND OF NEWS IS TO BETTER TRAIN IRAQI JOURNALISTS? SUGGESTS HASHIM HASSAN AL-TAMIMI DEAN OF THE?ŸCOLLEGE OF MASS COMMUNICATION?ŸAT THE UNIVERSITY OF BAGHDAD. ??IRAQIS URGENTLY WANT NEWS ABOUT SECURITY AND ABOUT POLITICS. THE REAL MEDIA SHOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THEM WITH THIS INFORMATION INSTEAD OF ALLOWING RUMORS ON SOCIAL MEDIA TO INCITE HATRED.? THIS REPORT WAS PREPARED BY NIQASH IN COOPERATION WITH BELLINGCAT THE MEDIA ACADEMY IRAQ AND IRAQI MEMBERS OF THE FAKE POSTS PAGE. ,5439.0

LAST MONTH WASSERMAN SCHULTZ SINGLE HANDEDLY ALIENATED A LARGE ENERGETIC SEGMENT OF BERNIE SANDERS?? BASE CAUSED ONE OF HER CHIEF LIEUTENANTS TO RIP ON THE DNC ON LIVE TELEVISION AND NOW HAS NUMEROUS PETITIONS CALLING FOR HER OUSTER. #YOLO THE WHITE HOUSE (AND OTHERS) EVEN ATTEMPTED TO PEER-PRESSURE HER OUT IN 2014 AFTER ACCUSING HER OF PUTTING HER OWN AMBITIONS OVER THE PARTY. IN RESPONSE TO THE LATEST FLOOD OF CRITICISM WASSERMAN SCHULTZ HAS ATTEMPTED TO WALK HER COMMENT BACK BUT THE DAMAGE MAY ALREADY BE DONE. THE PROGRESSIVE GROUP CREDO ACTION JUMPED AT THE ANTI-MILLENNIAL-FEMINIST CHARGE AND CIRCULATED A PETITION TO ITS 3.9 MILLION STRONG LIBERAL ARMY CALLING ON WASSERMAN SCHULTZ TO STEP DOWN.

THAT PETITION HAS RECEIVED MORE THAN 46000 ONLINE SIGNATURES. IN SOME WAYS WASSERMAN SCHULTZ MAY BE THE GREATEST GIFT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS GIVEN THE GOP IN THIS TRUMP-ERA. SHE ENJOYS A NATIONAL PERCH WHERE SHE??S CHARGED WITH KEEPING THE WHITE HOUSE IN DEMOCRATIC HANDS BUT SHE??S ALIENATED??OR ALIENATING??THE MOST ENERGETIC WING OF HER PARTY. SANDERS SUPPORTERS (AND MARTIN O??MALLEY??S??SUPPORTER?)

AFTER EXOTIC KGB-LINKED MURDERS ON THE STREETS OF LONDON THAT SPAN FOUR DECADES BRITAIN SHOULD KNOW. THE RADIOACTIVE POISONING OF ALEXANDER LITVINENKO CAME A GENERATION AFTER ANOTHER DISSIDENT WAS STRUCK DOWN IN BROAD DAYLIGHT BY A POWERFUL TOXIN.

THAT WAS ALSO THE INITIAL RESPONSE OF THE BRITISH AUTHORITIES WHEN RUSSIAN WHISTLEBLOWER ALEXANDER PEREPILICHNYY?ŸCOLLAPSED AND DIED WHILE RUNNING NEAR HIS SUBURBAN HOME OUTSIDE LONDON IN NOVEMBER 2012.

IN 1990 THE RUSSIAN DOUBLE-AGENT OLEG GORDIEVSKI REVEALED THAT THE KGB HAD SUPPLIED THE POISON AND DEVELOPED THE JAMES BOND-STYLE UMBRELLA GUN. THEY HAD GIVEN IT TO THEIR EASTERN BLOC COUNTERPARTS IN COMMUNIST BULGARIA. LEAKED BULGARIAN DOCUMENTS SHOWED IN 2005 THAT A DANISH ASSASSIN HAD BEEN HIRED AS THE UMBRELLA CARRIER. MARKOV COULD SEE A SMALL RED MARK ON HIS LEG BUT HE HAD NO IDEA THAT A TINY PELLET OF RICIN HAD BEEN FIRED BENEATH HIS SKIN. HE HAD DEVELOPED A FEVER BY THE TIME HE GOT HOME THAT NIGHT AND WITHIN FOUR DAYS HE WAS DEAD. ,63736.0
997,10177545.0,2016-01-22T05:01:00+00:00,WHY DO COPS SEE GUNS THAT AREN??T THERE?,IT HAPPENS WITH DISTURBING REGULARITY. POLICE SHOOT SOMEONE WHO IS UNARMED ALL TOO OFTEN A BLACK MALE. AND AS THE OFFICER RECOUNTS THEIR VERSION OF WHAT HAPPENED THEY FREQUENTLY REPEAT THE SAME PHRASE: ??I THOUGHT HE WAS ARMED.? IT??S IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY EXACTLY WHAT THE OFFICER PERCEIVED AND THE VISUAL INFORMATION THEIR BRAIN USED TO DETERMINE A PERSON WAS ARMED. FAR FROM ACTING LIKE RELIABLE HIGH-DEFINITION CAMERAS OUR VISION IS ACTUALLY RATHER IMPERFECT TRANSMITTING ONLY BITS AND PIECES OF THE WHOLE PICTURE AND LEAVING THE REST FOR OUR BRAIN TO FILL IN. AND IN HIGH-STRESS SITUATIONS SAYS A NEW STUDY IN THE JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY OUR BRAINS PRIORITIZE THE PROCESSING OF COARSE FEATURES RATHER THAN THE FINE DETAILS THAT WOULD ENABLE SOMEONE TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A REAL GUN AND A CELL PHONE CAN OF SODA OR EVEN A TOY GUN. ??HOW STRESSED WE ARE AFFECTS HOW WE PERCEIVE? SAID KARIN ROELOFS A NEUROPSYCHOLOGIST AT RADBOUD UNIVERSITY IN THE NETHERLANDS AND SENIOR AUTHOR OF THE NEW STUDY. ALL STUDENTS IN INTRODUCTORY PSYCHOLOGY CLASSES LEARN ABOUT THE FIGHT-OR-FLIGHT RESPONSE AND HOW WHEN AN ANIMAL PERCEIVES A THREAT IT PREPARES TO TAKE A STAND OR RUN AWAY. THERE??S ALSO A THIRD OPTION IN WHICH THE ANIMAL FREEZES IN PLACE. IT??S THE DEER-IN-HEADLIGHTS PHENOMENON AND SERVES TO PROTECT THE ANIMAL FROM PREDATORS THAT OFTEN HUNT BY DETECTING MOVEMENT. IN DANGEROUS SITUATIONS HUMANS WILL FREEZE TOO OUR NERVOUS SYSTEMS GOVERNED BY THE SAME HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF YEARS OF EVOLUTION. ANIMALS USE THE TIME WHILE ??FROZEN? TO TAKE IN INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR SURROUNDINGS AND MAKE THE DECISION WHETHER TO FIGHT OR RUN. SCIENTISTS GENERALLY BELIEVED THAT FREEZING BEHAVIOR HEIGHTENED SENSORY PERCEPTION BUT NO ONE HAD ACTUALLY MEASURED THIS IN THE LAB. WHAT ROELOFS AND HER TEAM WANTED TO KNOW WAS HOW FEELING THREATENED AND THE SUBSEQUENT FREEZING BEHAVIOR ALTERED VISUAL PERCEPTION IN HUMANS. SHE RECRUITED 34 HEALTHY YOUNG ADULTS TO COMPLETE A TASK THAT ASKED THEM TO JUDGE WHETHER A SERIES OF LINES WERE HORIZONTAL OR VERTICAL. SOME OF THE OPTIONS CONTAINED A FEW LARGE LINES WHICH SIMULATED COARSE INFORMATION WHEREAS OTHERS CONTAINED MANY THINNER LINES TO SIMULATE FINE DETAIL. BUT THERE WAS A CATCH. ROELOFS ALSO INTERMITTENTLY DISPLAYED A RED OR A GREEN DOT. OCCASIONALLY THE RED DOT WAS FOLLOWED BY A MILD ELECTRIC SHOCK THAT WAS UNPLEASANT BUT NOT PAINFUL OR DANGEROUS. THE SIGHT OF THE RED DOT ELICITED FREEZING BEHAVIOR. WHEN ROELOFS AND COLLEAGUES MEASURED HOW WELL THE SUBJECTS DID THEY FOUND THAT THE STRESSED AND FEARFUL CONDITIONS IMPROVED THEIR ABILITIES ON THE LOW DETAIL IMAGES BUT HAMPERED THEIR JUDGEMENT ON THE HIGH DETAIL IMAGES. ??THE BRAIN IS ALWAYS MAKING PREDICTIONS ABOUT WHAT WE SEE. IT??S GENERALLY MORE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF SOMETHING??S THERE THAN WHAT IT IS? ROELOFS SAID. THESE AND OTHER STUDIES HELP TO UNDERLINE THE CLOSE LINKS BETWEEN EMOTION AND PERCEPTION. THE BRAIN HAS CERTAIN TEMPLATES THAT HELP US PREDICT WHAT TO EXPECT SAYS APRAJITA MOHANTY A PSYCHOLOGIST AT STONY BROOK UNIVERSITY. IF YOU??RE DRIVING ON SNOW YOU INSTINCTIVELY LOOK OUT FOR ICY PATCHES. IF YOU SEE A BLACK PERSON YEARS OF GROWING UP IN A PREJUDICED CULTURE MAY MAKE YOU ASSUMED THEY ARE ARMED AND DANGEROUS. ??YOUR BRAIN IS NEVER REALLY WALKING INTO A SITUATION BLIND? SHE SAID. HOWEVER ROELOFS CAUTIONS THAT HER STUDY TOOK PLACE UNDER CONTROLLED LAB CONDITIONS WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SAY EXACTLY HOW THESE RESULTS MIGHT APPLY TO THE REAL WORLD WHERE TENSE SITUATIONS OFTEN REQUIRE SPLIT SECOND DECISIONS. OTHER STUDIES PROVIDE SOME DETAIL THAT PROVIDES CLUES ABOUT HOW THE BRAIN MAKES RAPID DECISIONS WHILE UNDER STRESS SUCH AS WHEN A COP PULLS A GUN ON A CIVILIAN. RACIAL BIAS IS EVERYWHERE IN AMERICA AND POLICE ARE NO MORE IMMUNE THAN ANYONE ELSE. SOCIAL NEUROSCIENTIST DANIEL AMODIO OF NEW YORK UNIVERSITY HAS SPENT HIS CAREER STUDYING HOW THOUGHTS AND EMOTIONS INCLUDING STEREOTYPES AFFECT PERCEPTION AND BEHAVIOR. ONE OF HIS STUDIES ASKED A RACIALLY DIVERSE GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS FROM DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD TO PLAY A COMPUTER GAME IN WHICH THEY WERE THE POLICE OFFICER AND HAD TO DECIDE WHETHER THE PERSON ON SCREEN WAS ARMED AND WHETHER TO SHOOT THEM. REGARDLESS OF THE ETHNICITY OF THE PARTICIPANT THE AMERICANS WERE FAR MORE LIKELY TO SHOOT AFRICAN-AMERICANS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE ARMED. WHEN AMODIO AND HIS TEAM TRACKED THE EYE MOVEMENTS OF THE PARTICIPANTS TO SEE WHAT THEY WERE LOOKING AT HE FOUND THAT PEOPLE ALWAYS LOOKED AT THE FACE OF THE PERSON ON THE SCREEN BEFORE THEY SHIFTED THEIR GAZE TO THE OBJECT THEY WERE CARRYING. THE PROBLEM WAS THAT THEY HAD MADE THE DECISION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TO SHOOT BEFORE THEY TURNED THEIR ATTENTION TO THE OBJECT TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT WAS A GUN OR SOMETHING NON-THREATENING. OTHER OF HIS SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE STUDIES SHOW THAT PEOPLE OFTEN SHOW DECREASED NEURAL PROCESSING OF FACES FROM DIFFERENT RACIAL OR ETHNIC GROUPS MEANING THAT PEOPLE SEE THEM AS BEING IN SOME WAYS LESS HUMAN. ??IF YOU??RE UNDER STRESS AND NEED TO ACT QUICKLY YOU TEND TO RELY ON MENTAL SHORTCUTS? SUCH AS PREJUDICE AND STEREOTYPES AMODIO SAID. ??IF SOMEONE IS AMPED UP AND AFRAID BECAUSE THERE MIGHT BE A SHOOTER AND THEY SEE A KID LIKE WITH WHAT HAPPENED WITH TAMIR RICE THEY SAY THAT WHEN I DROVE UP I SAW A MAN WHO LOOKED TO BE ARMED. IN THE SPLIT SECOND IT TOOK FOR THE OFFICER TO DRIVE UP AND SHOOT IT??S QUITE POSSIBLE THAT ALL OF THESE INSTINCTS LEAD TO THAT DECISION.? THIS ISN??T TO SAY THAT THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE TO THESE SHOOTINGS IS A DEFENSE OF ??MY BRAIN MADE ME DO IT.? RATHER THE GOAL OF HIS WORK AMODIO SAYS IS TO TRY AND COUNTER THESE PREJUDICES AND UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE MAKE THESE SNAP DECISIONS TO PROVIDE BETTER TRAINING TO POLICE OFFICERS. RACIAL BIAS PLAYS A KEY ROLE BECAUSE IT??S THE RAW MATERIAL FROM WHICH THE BRAIN FILLS IN OUR PERCEPTUAL GAPS. ??WE NEED TO RAISE AWARENESS OF HOW BIAS MIGHT AFFECT WHAT POLICE OFFICERS SEE? AMODIO SAYS. TO MOHANTY OUR PERCEPTION IS DRIVEN BY OUR BIASES. ??THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS TRUE PERCEPTION? SHE SAID. ??MODIFYING OUR BELIEFS CAN CHANGE HOW WE PERCEIVE.? ,4778.0
737,10010695.0,2016-01-17T05:01:00+00:00,THIS IS YOUR BRAIN ON TRUMP,BLOODTHIRSTY RAGE APPEARS TO HAVE SWEPT UP THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. LIKE MASS HYSTERIA BOILING UP IN AN ANGRY MOB. DISCUSSIONS OF DEADLY VIOLENCE HAVE BECOME CENTRAL TO THIS PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION SEASON WITH CALLS FOR KILLING IN POLITICAL ADS AND DEBATES NOT JUST THE RAVINGS OF A SINGLE FRINGE CANDIDATE. GONE ARE THE INTELLECTUAL ARGUMENTS THAT HAVE DOMINATED OUR PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES FOR TWO CENTURIES??THIS TIME IT IS THE BRAIN??S LIMBIC SYSTEM ??FEAR CENTER? NOT THE CEREBRAL CORTEX THAT CANDIDATES ARE TAPPING TO DRIVE PUBLIC DISCOURSE. THE WORD ??KILL? WAS SAID 53 TIMES IN THE DEC. 15 2015 REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY DEBATE. HERE??S A SAMPLING. TED CRUZ: ???? WE WILL HUNT DOWN AND KILL THE TERRORISTS.? DONALD TRUMP: ??THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO KILL US??? TRUMP ALSO ADVOCATES KILLING FAMILY MEMBERS OF ISIS TERRORISTS. LINDSAY GRAHAM: ??THEY??RE TRYING TO COME HERE TO KILL US ALL??? MIKE HUCKABEE: ??WE HAVE TO KILL SOME TERRORISTS AND KILL EVERY ONE OF THEM??.? BY CONTRAST THE WORD ??KILL? WAS NEVER USED IN THE 1960 NIXON-KENNEDY PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE DESPITE THE ERA??S DIRE THREAT OF GLOBAL NUCLEAR ANNIHILATION. THE ??K? WORD WAS NOT SPOKEN BY ANY OF 2000??S REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES??GEORGE W. BUSH ALAN KEYS OR JOHN MCCAIN??IN THEIR FINAL DEBATE ON MARCH 2 OF THAT YEAR NOR WAS IT UTTERED IN THE JAN. 30 2008 FINAL GOP DEBATE AMONG CANDIDATES HUCKABEE MCCAIN RON PAUL AND MITT ROMNEY. CLEARLY THESE URGENT CALLS FOR KILLING ARE A REACTION TO THE WIDESPREAD FEAR OF TERRORISM GRIPPING OUR NATION. BUT WHEN WE OPERATE OUT OF FEAR WE ARE PRONE TO MAKING MISTAKES. THIS IS NOT A MATTER OF POLICY??IT??S PHYSIOLOGY. REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT HAWK OR DOVE HOW OUR BRAIN RESPONDS AT TIMES OF PERCEIVED DANGER AND HOW OUR COGNITIVE FUNCTION AND BEHAVIORAL REACTIONS ARE OVERWHELMED BY FEAR MUST BE FULLY RECOGNIZED. THE U.S. HAS FACED FRIGHTENING DANGERS DURING EVERY ELECTION SEASON. WHY DO WE FIND OURSELVES IN A PANIC THIS TIME? IN THIS ELECTION FEAR DOES NOT ARISE FROM A RATIONAL DEDUCTION OF POTENTIAL DANGERS??IT IS PRIMAL. BACK IN THE COLD WAR ERA THERE WAS LITTLE ANYONE FACED WITH IMPENDING THERMONUCLEAR ARMAGEDDON COULD DO OTHER THAN FREEZE IN FEAR OR FLEE. HIDING IN BOMB SHELTERS WAS HOW FEAR MOVED 1960??S ELECTORATE. TODAY THE TERROR IS COMING TO US PERSONALLY??A MANIAC WITH A SHOTGUN BLASTING INTO OUR SCHOOLS LURKING IN OUR SHOPPING MALLS INVADING THE CORRIDORS OF OUR OFFICE BUILDINGS WITH A GUN BARREL POINTED AT US. THIS FEAR OF A PERSONAL CONFRONTATION WITH A KILLER STRIKES DEEP WITHIN US. IT??S ALSO THE LEADING SCENARIO OF TERRIFYING RECURRENT NIGHTMARES ACCORDING TO A 2015 STUDY. A PEEK INSIDE THE BRAIN CAN HELP US UNDERSTAND HOW THE UNUSUAL INTERSECTION BETWEEN POLITICAL SCIENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE IS DRIVING THIS ELECTION. THE BIOLOGICAL REFLEX FOR VIOLENT AGGRESSION DOES NOT RESIDE IN THE CEREBRAL CORTEX WHERE CONSCIOUSNESS ARISES. THE CIRCUITRY FOR THREAT-DETECTION FEAR AND VIOLENCE IS CENTERED DEEP IN THE BRAIN IN WHAT SCIENTISTS CALL THE HYPOTHALAMIC ATTACK AREA. EXCLUDING MENTAL ILLNESS OR CRIMINALITY ONLY A FEW SPECIFIC PROVOCATIONS WILL TRIGGER THE RAGE CIRCUIT IN OUR BRAIN TO LAUNCH US INTO VIOLENT ACTION. THE MOST OBVIOUS ONE: SELF-DEFENSE. THE BOMBING OF PEARL HARBOR AND THE DESTRUCTION OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTER PROVOKED AN IMMEDIATE STRONG COMMITMENT OF MEN AND WOMEN TO JOIN THE ARMED FORCES. THERE IS NOT SPACE TO TRACE OUT THE NINE TRIGGERS OF RAGE HERE HOWEVER THE ARGUMENTS IN THE REPUBLICAN DEBATES AND CAMPAIGN ADS PRESS FORCEFULLY ON EIGHT OF THEM. NO WONDER THERE IS SO MUCH TALK OF KILLING. HISTORY SHOWS THAT POLITICAL LEADERS CAN EXPLOIT THE BRAIN??S TRIGGERS OF RAGE TO INCITE THE POPULACE TO ENGAGE IN VIOLENCE AND WAR. THE VIETNAM WAR WAS LAUNCHED ON A FALSE PRETEXT U.S. NAVY DESTROYERS WERE ATTACKED BY THE NORTH VIETNAMESE ON AUG. 4 1964. COLIN POWELL WAVED A MOCK VIAL OF ANTHRAX IN THE UNITED NATIONS TO PERSUADE ??A COALITION OF THE WILLING? TO INVADE IRAQ TO ELIMINATE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION THAT POSED AN IMMINENT THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES. ??I DEEPLY REGRET THAT THE INFORMATION??SOME OF THE INFORMATION NOT ALL OF IT??WAS WRONG? POWELL SAID IN 2011 LOOKING BACK ON HIS ROLE IN LAUNCHING THE IRAQ WAR. SOME HISTORIANS HAVE CHARGED THAT PRESIDENT FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT IGNORED THE FLOTILLA OF JAPANESE WARSHIPS STEAMING TOWARD PEARL HARBOR SO THAT THEIR SNEAK ATTACK WOULD ENRAGE THE AMERICAN PUBLIC AND INCITE A DECLARATION OF WAR. THE MERIT IN THIS CHARGE IS LESS IMPORTANT THAN RECOGNIZING THAT EXPLOITING THE BRAIN??S TRIGGER FOR SELF-DEFENSE WILL INCITE VIOLENT RAGE IN THE MINDS OF PEOPLE AND OVERLOOKING A BATTLE GROUP IN THE PACIFIC IS MUCH HARDER TO DO THAN OVERLOOKING TERRORIST CHATTER ON THE INTERNET. WE SEEM CAUGHT UP IN A FRENZY OF MASS HYSTERIA AND FEAR INFLAMED BY VIOLENT RHETORIC. FIFTY-FIVE AMERICANS DIED IN AFGHANISTAN IN 2015 6830 U.S. SERVICE MEMBERS AND THEIR WESTERN ALLIES HAVE BEEN KILLED IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN SINCE 2001. THESE STATISTICS REFLECT A HORRIBLE LOSS OF LIFE AND COURAGEOUS SELF-SACRIFICE BUT TO ASSESS THE CURRENT LEVEL OF FEAR THESE CASUALTIES MUST BE PUT INTO HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE WITH OTHER DREADFUL TERRORS THIS NATION HAS FACED: THE 750000 LIVES LOST IN THE CIVIL WAR AND THE 6 MILLION JEWS KILLED IN WORLD WAR II. CHRONIC STRESS PUTS THE BRAIN ON A HEIGHTENED STATE OF ALERT IN WHICH WE ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO SNAP VIOLENTLY??TO OVERRIDE RATIONAL THOUGHT AND UNLEASH VIOLENCE IN RESPONSE TO SLIGHT PROVOCATIONS. OUR NATION HAS SUFFERED FROM CHRONIC STRESS SINCE THE 9/11 TERROR ATTACKS. THIS PROLONGED STRESS MAKES US JUMPY AND PRONE TO ??SHOOT FIRST AND ASK QUESTIONS LATER.? ANOTHER PHYSIOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCE OF THIS FEAR AND FIXATION ON CATCHING ??THE BAD GUY? IS TUNNEL VISION. A RETIRED D.C. COP BROKE INTO A COLD SWEAT TELLING ME OF AN ADRENALINE-CHARGED PURSUIT OF A SUSPECT FLEEING AT MORE THAN 100 MILES PER HOUR ON INTERSTATE 95. THE OFFICER EVENTUALLY FORCED THE VEHICLE OFF THE HIGHWAY AND TOOK THE DRIVER INTO CUSTODY. ??WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER GUY?? HE WAS ASKED WHEN HIS BACKUP OFFICERS FINALLY ARRIVED. FIXATED ON THE DRIVER HE NEVER SAW THE PASSENGER STILL SITTING THERE WITH A LOADED .45-CALIBER HANDGUN IN HIS LAP. IN THE 14 YEARS SINCE AL QAEDA CARRIED OUT ATTACKS ON NEW YORK AND THE PENTAGON EXTREMISTS HAVE KILLED 74 PEOPLE IN DOMESTIC TERRORISM IN THE UNITED STATES OF THOSE THE MAJORITY 48 VICTIMS WERE KILLED BY NON-MUSLIM EXTREMISTS. THE BIGGEST THREAT IN DOMESTIC TERRORISM COMES FROM INTERNAL ANTIGOVERNMENT EXTREMISTS (74 PERCENT). THE TERROR OF 9/11 THE MASSACRES IN PARIS THE BOMBS AT THE MARATHON IN BOSTON ARE HORRIFIC BUT WHAT ABOUT THE CATASTROPHIC DANGER OF NORTH KOREA THREATENING THERMONUCLEAR ATTACK? WHAT ABOUT THE SOVIET UNION AND CHINA EXERCISING THEIR GROWING MILITARY MUSCLE PROBING OTHER NATION??S BORDERS AND THREATENING WAR? THERE SEEM TO BE NO LACK OF ISSUES OR DANGERS PRESSING ON THIS COUNTRY BUT THE HYSTERIA OF TRACKING DOWN AND KILLING MUSLIM EXTREMISTS BLINDS US TO ALL ELSE. VERBAL THREATS ARE IN THEMSELVES A FORM OF VIOLENCE AND THREATS ARE ESPECIALLY DANGEROUS IN LARGE GROUPS OF PEOPLE BE THEY MOBS GANGS OR NATIONS. THREATS TO SET THE SANDS GLOWING WITH CARPET BOMBS (QUOTING TED CRUZ) TRIGGER VIOLENT RAGE IN THOSE WHO ARE THREATENED. DRAWING A LINE IN THE SAND AND VOWING TO SHOOT DOWN A RUSSIAN JET THAT CROSSES IT (AS CHRISTIE VOWED) IS A STREET-THUG CHALLENGE THAT RISKS WAR IN WHICH BOTH SIDES WOULD FEEL RIGHTEOUSLY JUSTIFIED IN KILLING. THE SUBSTANCE OF THESE POSITIONS CAN BE DISCUSSED WITHOUT RESORTING TO THREATS OF DEATH BUT ATTEMPTS TO TEMPER PUBLIC DISCOURSE ARE BEING QUASHED. ??AND POLITICAL CORRECTNESS IS KILLING PEOPLE? AS CRUZ SAYS. FROM THE GABRIELLE GIFFORDS SHOOTING TO THE SLAUGHTER AT THE PLANNED PARENTHOOD CLINIC IN COLORADO THE TRAGIC EFFECTS OF VIOLENT RHETORIC ON UNSTABLE INDIVIDUALS AND EXTREMISTS IS INESCAPABLE. ??LIGHT THE MOTHERFUCKER ON FIRE!? A TRUMP SUPPORTER SCREAMED AT A PROTESTER WHO WAS BEING FORCIBLY REMOVED FROM A RECENT TRUMP RALLY. ??SHOOT HIM! KICK HIS ASS!? RAUCOUS TRUMP SUPPORTERS SCREAMED AT ANOTHER DEMONSTRATOR. URGENT PUBLIC CALLS FOR KILLING ARE AS DANGEROUS AND IRRESPONSIBLE AS SCREAMING ??FIRE? IN A CROWDED MOVIE THEATER. THE HUMAN BRAIN IS NOT A SLAVE TO ITS FEAR CIRCUIT. ??FEAR IS A FORCE THAT SHARPENS YOUR SENSES? WRITES NAVY SEAL MARCUS LUTTRELL THE ONLY SURVIVING MEMBER OF A HORRENDOUS TALIBAN AMBUSH DESCRIBED IN HIS BOOK LONE SURVIVOR. ?ŸINHIBITION OF THE BRAIN??S THREAT-RESPONSE CIRCUITRY BY THE CEREBRAL CORTEX IS WHAT ENABLES A U.S. MARINE OR NAVY SEAL TO OPERATE EFFECTIVELY IN BATTLE AND TO TRIUMPH??TO USE FEAR??NOT BE PARALYZED BY IT DESPITE THE MOST INTENSE FEAR OF DEATH IMAGINABLE. IN THIS ELECTION MORE CARE MUST BE GIVEN TO THE BIOLOGICAL TRIGGERS OF RAGE IN THE HUMAN BRAIN. FEAR ITSELF CAN BE OUR BIGGEST THREAT. CIVIL DISCOURSE ENGAGES THE RATIONAL CEREBRAL CORTEX??NOT THE EMOTIONAL FEAR AND THREAT-DETECTION CIRCUITS OF THE LIMBIC SYSTEM. LET??S DEMAND ??TRIGGER LOCKS? ON VIOLENT RHETORIC. IN ACTING TOGETHER IN PUBLIC DISCOURSE OR ALONE WHEN WE ENTER THE VOTING BOOTH WE SHOULD USE THE MOST ASTONISHING BIT OF MATTER THE EARTH HAS EVER KNOWN: THE HUMAN CEREBRAL CORTEX AND NOT THE LIMBIC SYSTEM. ,15030.0

THE OLD RULES ARE OUT THE WINDOW. TECHNOLOGY AND CHANGING MORES HAVE CONSPIRED TO LOWER BARRIERS OF ENTRY??AND ACCEPTABILITY. GATEKEEPERS NO LONGER EXIST. WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IS CLOSER TO DIRECT DEMOCRACY THAN WE??VE EVER SEEN AND OUR CIVILIZATION IS REGRESSING AS A RESULT. ONE PARTY (THE DEMOCRATS) ALREADY REPRESENTS THE LIBERAL HALF OF THE NATION. THE OTHER HALF SEEMS TO CONSIST OF MODERN BUCKLEYITE CONSERVATIVES BUT ALSO AN INCREASINGLY LARGE HORDE POPULIST NATIONALIST INDIVIDUALISTIC AMERICANS??WHO NOW HAVE A MEGAPHONE AND A VESSEL IN THE FORM OF DONALD TRUMP. TIMES CHANGE AND POLITICAL PARTIES ADAPT OR ARE REPLACED. AND MAKE NO MISTAKE IF THE PARTY OF LINCOLN BECOMES THE PARTY OF TRUMP IT WOULD ESSENTIALLY REDEFINE WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A REPUBLICAN. CONSERVATISM A COHERENT POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY LOOKS AS IF IT??S BEING REPLACED BY MESSY RIGHT-WING POPULISM. JUST AS THE POLITICAL PARTIES SORTED THEMSELVES OUT SO THAT THERE ARE NO MORE ??CONSERVATIVE DEMOCRATS? OR ??LIBERAL REPUBLICANS? I FEAR WE MAY BE ENTERING A NEW STAGE WHERE THERE ARE ESSENTIALLY TWO DISTINCT POLITICAL TRIBES: ONE TRIBE CONSISTS OF MINORITIES AND EDUCATED ELITES WHILE THE OTHER TRIBE INCREASINGLY CONSISTS OF WORKING-CLASS WHITES. THE TRENDS THAT BROUGHT US THIS SITUATION HAVE BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR DECADES BUT 2015 MAY BE REMEMBERED AS THE YEAR WHEN WE BROKE APART AND POLITICAL DIFFERENCES BECAME PRIMARY CULTURAL SIGNIFIERS. DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT IDEOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES OR EVEN POLICY PREFERENCES SEEM TO BE TAKING A BACK SEAT TO IDENTITY POLITICS. IT DOESN??T MATTER WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN SO MUCH AS WHAT GROUPING YOU BELONG TO AND HOW WILLING YOU ARE TO FIGHT FOR THE SLIVER OF AMERICA YOU REPRESENT. 2015 WAS THE YEAR OF TRIBALISM. OUR POLITICS ARE LESS HIGH-MINDED THAN EVER. IF TRIBES STRIKE YOU AS PRIMITIVE IT??S NOT JUST YOU. TRIBES TEND TO ASSIGN LEADERSHIP NOT BASED ON EXPERIENCE OR WISDOM BUT BASED ON STRENGTH. MUCH OF WHAT WE ARE WITNESSING TODAY IS VERY BASE (NO PUN INTENDED) AND ESSENTIALLY COMES DOWN TO MACHISMO: THE OTHER GUYS ARE OUT TO GET US SO WE NEED OUR TOUGHEST GUY TO GET THEM FIRST. THIS IS THE MAJOR RATIONALE FOR TRUMP SUPPORTERS WHO SEE HIM AS AN ??ALPHA? IN A SEA OF WISHY-WASHY BELTWAY INSIDERS. CONSERVATIVES ONCE HATED IDENTITY POLITICS AND VICTIMHOOD??BUT THEN AGAIN WE ONCE SUPPORTED FREE TRADE TOO. PERHAPS OUR DISDAIN FOR TRIBALISM WAS ALWAYS A HIGH-MINDED YET DOOMED EFFORT TO SUPPRESS THE NATURAL CARNAL STATE OF A FALLEN HUMANITY. YOU AND I MAY VIEW POLITICS AS BEING ABOUT IDEAS AND HUMAN FLOURISHING BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE BELIEVE IT??S REALLY ABOUT POWER??ABOUT MAKING SURE SCARCE RESOURCES ARE ALLOCATED TO ??OUR? PEOPLE. ALTHOUGH I DIDN??T SEE THE TRUMP PHENOMENON COMING I THINK I SENSED THE POPULIST ZEITGEIST THAT LED BOTH TO HIM AND TO THIS LARGER BREAKDOWN INTO TRIBES. HERE??S SOMETHING I WROTE BACK IN APRIL FOR THE BEAST??LONG BEFORE TRUMP WAS IN THE RACE: ??I THINK THERE IS A HUGE UNDERSERVED CONSTITUENCY IN THE GOP??AND THAT CONSTITUENCY IS WHAT MIGHT BEST BE TERMED POPULIST CONSERVATIVES. THESE FOLKS TEND TO BE WHITE AND WORKING-CLASS AND WHO FEEL THEY??VE BEEN LEFT BEHIND IN AMERICA. THEY ARE CULTURALLY CONSERVATIVE??BUT?ŸTHEY ALSO WANT TO KEEP GOVERNMENT OUT OF THEIR MEDICARE. MITT ROMNEY WAS ARGUABLY THE WORST CANDIDATE REPUBLICANS COULD HAVE EVER NOMINATED TO APPEAL TO THIS CONSTITUENCY. BUT WHILE CANDIDATES LIKE HUCKABEE AND RICK SANTORUM FLIRTED WITH GOING FULL POPULIST SOMETHING ALWAYS SEEMED TO KEEP THEM FROM REALLY DOUBLING DOWN ON IT. ???ŸTHE LAST TIME SOMEONE REALLY TRIED THIS WAS WHEN ??PITCHFORK? PAT BUCHANAN AND THEN ROSS PEROT RAN IN 1992. IT RESONATED THEN BUT THAT WAS BEFORE THE ??GIANT SUCKING SOUND? REALLY KICKED IN. WHETHER IT??S GLOBALIZATION OR IMMIGRATION??OR WHATEVER ??-ATION? MIGHT HAVE TAKEN YOUR JOB??IT STANDS TO REASON THAT THE SAME GRASSROOTS PHENOMENON THAT HELPED BUCHANAN AND PEROT TAP INTO AN UNDERSERVED CONSTITUENCY MIGHT BE EVEN MORE POTENT TODAY I STILL THINK THERE??S A DECENT CHANCE THAT THIS FEVER??WHICH HAS BEEN AIDED BY AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN OBAMA??S ELECTION AND THE RISE OF ISIS??WILL BREAK. AND I THINK THAT THE RULES GOVERNING THE WAY THE GOP ALLOCATES DELEGATES WILL PROBABLY BENEFIT SOMEONE WHO IS A MORE MAINSTREAM AND THOUGHTFUL CONSERVATIVE LIKE MARCO RUBIO. IT??S EASY TO SEE HOW A RUBIO PRESIDENCY COULD HELP REORDER THINGS IN A DIFFERENT WAY??IN A WAY THAT I BELIEVE WOULD BE HEALTHIER BOTH FOR AMERICA AND IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE CONSERVATISM CAN SURVIVE AND THRIVE IN THE 21ST CENTURY. A RUBIO PRESIDENCY WOULD HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO GROW THE CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT BY MODERNIZING (NOT MODERATING) IT??TO MAKE IT MORE APPEALING TO HISPANICS URBANITES AND MILLENNIALS. IF CONSERVATISM IS ABOUT IDEAS LIKE FREEDOM AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP NOT MERELY CULTURAL SIGNALING (THE STEREOTYPE BEING THAT THE DEFINITION OF A CONSERVATIVE IS A WHITE GUY WITH A GUN RACK) THEN THERE??S NO REASON THE GUY WHO ORDERS AN UBER SHOULDN??T BE A CONSERVATIVE. BUT THIS ONLY WORKS IF THE CONSERVATIVES WANT TO ACTUALLY GROW THEIR NUMBERS BY CHOOSING A MODERNIZER. THE LAST CNN/ORC POLL I SAW SUGGESTED THAT IF YOU ADD TRUMP??S SUPPORTERS TOGETHER WITH THOSE OF TED CRUZ AND BEN CARSON YOU WERE AT ABOUT TWO-THIRDS OF THE NATIONAL GOP PRIMARY VOTERS. THE REJECTION OF CANDIDATES FAVORED BY THE GOP ESTABLISHMENT THIS PAST YEAR HAS BEEN UNPRECEDENTED. THE REPUBLICAN BASE AT LEAST RIGHT NOW IS RALLYING TO THE CANDIDATES WHO EMBRACE THIS NEW TRIBALISM. EARLIER I SAID THE RULES HAVE CHANGED. AND INDEED THEY HAVE. CONSERVATIVES USED TO CARE ABOUT ELECTING MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE WISDOM EXPERIENCE OR EXPERTISE AND WILL COMPORT THEMSELVES IN AN APPROPRIATE OR ??STATESMANLIKE? MANNER AND WHO HAVE A CONSERVATIVE TEMPERAMENT. THEY WERE DEEPLY INVESTED IN DEFENDING ABSTRACT CONCEPTS LIKE A CULTURE OF LIFE THE RULE OF LAW AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY WHILE ALSO WORRYING ABOUT THINGS LIKE UNINTENTIONAL CONSEQUENCES. THEY WANTED TO UNLEASH THE POWER OF A FREE MARKET (OF PRODUCTS AND IDEAS) TO ENCOURAGE HUMAN FLOURISHING. THESE ARE THE HALLMARKS OF CONSERVATIVE PHILOSOPHY CONSISTENCY AND A COHERENT WORLDVIEW??SOMETHING THAT LOOKS INCREASINGLY PASS?? TO REPUBLICAN VOTERS. IN SOME CASES MUCH OF TODAY??S GOP BASE IS SKEPTICAL OR EVEN HOSTILE TO THESE CONSERVATIVE VALUES. FOR EXAMPLE THEY BELIEVE A CONSERVATIVE TEMPERAMENT IS AN ANTIQUATED CONCEPT GUARANTEED TO PRODUCE WEAK LEADERS WHO WON??T FIGHT AND THAT CONSERVATISM AS A TEMPERAMENT WAS ESSENTIALLY DESIGNED TO FAIL. HOW ELSE CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE NEAR-TRIUMPH OF CONTEMPORARY LIBERALISM AND THE FACT THAT THE GOP HAS ONLY WON THE POPULAR VOTE IN A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION ONCE SINCE THE END OF THE REAGAN ERA? IT??S HARD TO SUMMON PEOPLE TO THEIR BETTER ANGELS WHEN THOSE PEOPLE FEEL AGGRIEVED. IT??S HARD TO ADVISE THOSE PEOPLE TO ??KEEP YOUR HEAD WHEN ALL ABOUT YOU?ŸARE LOSING THEIRS???WHEN THERE ARE LITERAL BEHEADINGS TAKING PLACE AROUND THE GLOBE. THE PROBLEM IS THAT PEOPLE LIKE ME ARE CALLING FOR CIVILIZED BEHAVIOR AND FOR MODERNIZATION AT A TIME WHEN REPUBLICAN VOTERS WANT TO GET MEDIEVAL. 2015 BELONGED TO DONALD TRUMP. BUT THE REAL QUESTION IS THIS: WHO WILL OWN 2016? MATT K. LEWIS IS AUTHOR OF THE FORTHCOMING BOOK TOO DUMB TO FAIL: HOW THE GOP BETRAYED THE REAGAN REVOLUTION TO WIN ELECTIONS (AND HOW IT CAN RECLAIM ITS CONSERVATIVE ROOTS). ,20968.0

GOLDBERG SERVES ON THE BOARD OF THE CYBER CIVIL RIGHTS INITIATIVE (CCRI) AND AS A VOLUNTEER ATTORNEY FOR THE ORGANIZATION??S END REVENGE PORN (ERP) INITIATIVE. WHEN SOMEONE??USUALLY BUT NOT ALWAYS A WOMAN ACCORDING TO ERP STATISTICS??DISCOVERS THAT SEXUAL IMAGES OR VIDEOS OF HERSELF HAVE BEEN POSTED ONLINE WITHOUT HER CONSENT HER FIRST INSTINCT IS USUALLY TO GET THEM TAKEN DOWN RIGHT AWAY. BUT RUSHING TO REMOVE THEM GOLDBERG SAYS CAN MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO PENALIZE THE OFFENDER WHO IN THE MAJORITY OF REVENGE PORN CASES IS AN EX-BOYFRIEND. ??THE KNEEJERK REACTION FOR MOST VICTIMS IS TO IMMEDIATELY DO WHATEVER THEY CAN TO REMOVE THE CONTENT EVEN THOUGH THE CONTENT IS REALLY NECESSARY TO PROVE A CRIMINAL OR A CIVIL CASE? SAID GOLDBERG. GOLDBERG??S BROOKLYN LAW FIRM SPECIALIZES IN CASES OF INTERNET PRIVACY ABUSE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL CONSENT. IN HER PRACTICE SHE ADVISES REVENGE PORN VICTIMS TO RECORD AS MUCH EVIDENCE AS THEY CAN INCLUDING MESSAGES SENT BY THE OFFENDER VIEW COUNTS UPLOAD DATES AND EVEN THE COMMENTS SECTION BELOW THE POSTS. ??[COMMENTS] TEND TO BE VERY VIOLENT AND GRAPHIC? GOLDBERG EXPLAINED. ??COMMENTS ARE INSTRUCTIONAL BECAUSE IF YOU??RE TRYING TO GET THE POLICE OR A JUDGE TO UNDERSTAND THE HARM OF REVENGE PORN??AND HOW THE CONSUMERS OF REVENGE PORN END UP BECOMING HARASSERS BY PROXY??THEN THE COMMENTS SHOW THAT.? 2015 WAS THE YEAR WHEN SILICON VALLEY FINALLY BEGAN TO TAKE REVENGE PORN MORE SERIOUSLY. TWITTER FACEBOOK REDDIT AND GOOGLE ALL FORMALLY ANNOUNCED BANS ON THE PRACTICE IN WHICH SEXUAL PHOTOS TAKEN WITHOUT CONSENT OR WITHIN A RELATIONSHIP ARE DISSEMINATED ONLINE OFTEN ALONGSIDE THE VICTIM??S FULL NAME OR CONTACT INFORMATION. IN OCTOBER PORNHUB THE LARGEST PORN WEBSITE ON THE INTERNET ALSO LAUNCHED A NEW CONTENT REMOVAL FORM FOR REVENGE PORN VICTIMS TO FILE TAKEDOWN REQUESTS MORE EASILY. IT WAS ALSO THE YEAR WHEN REVENGE PORN LEGISLATION CROSSED A TIPPING POINT. NOW TWENTY-SIX STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HAVE LAWS PERTAINING TO REVENGE PORN WITH BILLS PENDING IN SEVERAL OTHER STATES. BUT EVEN AS LEGISLATIVE AND TECHNOLOGICAL SUPPORT FOR VICTIMS GROWS MANY WOMEN ARE STILL UNCERTAIN ABOUT WHAT THEY SHOULD DO IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF DISCOVERING IMAGES OF THEMSELVES ONLINE. ONE WEEK AGO FOR INSTANCE A REDDIT USER POSTING UNDER A BURNER ACCOUNT ON THE TWOXCHROMOSOMES SUBREDDIT SAID THAT SHE WAS SHOCKED TO FIND PORNOGRAPHIC VIDEOS OF HER AND HER BOYFRIEND ON THE INTERNET. ??WHAT ARE MY OPTIONS?? SHE ASKED. ??WHERE DO I TURN?? THE MOST RELIABLE OPTION IS 10 DIGITS LONG. THE CCRI RUNS A FREE 24/7 HELPLINE FOR U.S. VICTIMS OF NONCONSENSUAL PORNOGRAPHY. IN ADDITION TO CALLING THAT NUMBER GOLDBERG HAS SEVERAL CRUCIAL PIECES OF ADVICE FOR REVENGE PORN VICTIMS. FIRST SHE SAYS VICTIMS SHOULD QUICKLY ADJUST THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA PRIVACY SETTINGS SETTING UP TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION FOR ADDED SECURITY. ??AS SOON AS THE VICTIM REALIZES THAT SHE??S BEEN THE VICTIM OF REVENGE PORN SHE NEEDS TO LOCK DOWN HER SOCIAL MEDIA? SHE SAID. THIS STEP IS ESSENTIAL BECAUSE EXES AND OTHER OFFENDERS OFTEN POST THE IMAGES ON DEDICATED REVENGE PORN WEBSITES ALONG WITH IDENTIFYING INFORMATION OR DEROGATORY STATEMENTS ABOUT THE VICTIMS THAT MAY ENCOURAGE STALKING HARASSMENT OR HACKING ATTEMPTS. FORTY-NINE PERCENT OF RESPONDENTS TO AN ERP SURVEY SAID THAT THEIR NONCONSENSUALLY-POSTED IMAGES WERE ACCOMPANIED BY THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA HANDLE OR A SCREENSHOT OF THEIR PROFILE. SIXTEEN PERCENT SAID THEIR HOME ADDRESS WAS ATTACHED TO THE MATERIAL. AN IMPORTANT ASIDE: ALTHOUGH GOLDBERG TELLS VICTIMS TO MAKE THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS MORE SECURE SHE ALSO ADVISES AGAINST BLOCKING THE OFFENDER FROM SENDING INCOMING MESSAGES AS VILE AS THEY MIGHT BE SO THAT THEY CAN BE USED IN A CRIMINAL OR CIVIL CASE. THEN TO DISCOVER JUST HOW FAR THE REVENGE PORN HAS SPREAD GOLDBERG RECOMMENDS THAT VICTIMS GOOGLE THEMSELVES ALONGSIDE DEROGATORY TERMS SUCH AS ??SLUT? OR ??MY SLUTTY EX.? ??THE VICTIM??S NAME ALONE MIGHT NOT COME UP WITH LINKS TO REVENGE PORN BUT IF YOU ADD THE WORD ??WHORE?? AFTER HER NAME OR SOMETHING THAT THE OFFENDER WOULD HAVE POSTED ALONGSIDE HER NAME THAT CAN LEAD TO MORE MATERIAL? SHE TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. ??IT??S SO IMPORTANT FOR THE VICTIM TO KNOW THE BREADTH OF THE ATTACK.? AFTER EVIDENCE COLLECTION VICTIMS FACE TWO CONCURRENT TASKS: TAKING LEGAL ACTION AND GETTING THE OFFENSIVE MATERIAL WIPED FROM THE WEB. THE LATTER TASK CAN BE DIZZYINGLY COMPLEX BUT ERP??S ONLINE REMOVAL GUIDE CONTAINS INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING REMOVAL REQUESTS TO SOCIAL MEDIA SERVICES LIKE FACEBOOK INSTAGRAM TWITTER REDDIT AND TUMBLR AND TO SEARCH ENGINES LIKE YAHOO GOOGLE AND BING. WITHOUT A REMOVAL FORM VICTIMS MUST DIRECTLY CONTACT WEBMASTERS ASKING FOR REMOVAL AND STIPULATING THAT ALL METADATA BE PRESERVED FOR FUTURE LITIGATION??REQUESTS THAT GOLDBERG SAYS OFTEN WON??T BE HONORED WITHOUT A SUBPOENA. BARRING THAT IF A VICTIM CAN CLAIM COPYRIGHT TO THE MATERIAL??A SELFIE FOR INSTANCE??A DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT (DMCA) TAKEDOWN LETTER MIGHT DO THE TRICK. ??THERE AREN??T A LOT OF RULES ON THE INTERNET BUT ONE SET OF RULES THAT MOST ONLINE SERVICE PROVIDERS AND WEBMASTERS TAKE SERIOUSLY ARE COPYRIGHT RULES SO THAT CAN BE A VERY POWERFUL TOOL FOR VICTIMS? SAID GOLDBERG. LEGAL RECOURSE FOR REVENGE PORN VICTIMS IS A SIMILARLY PATCHWORK SYSTEM. ALTHOUGH THE MAJORITY OF STATES NOW HAVE REVENGE PORN LAWS ON THE BOOKS NOT ALL LAWS ARE CREATED EQUAL. SOME REQUIRE PROOF OF INTENT TO CAUSE DISTRESS IN ORDER TO PROSECUTE SOME HAVE WEAK PUNISHMENTS OTHERS HAVE EXEMPTIONS FOR PUBLIC FIGURES. GOLDBERG HOLDS UP ILLINOIS?? NEW REVENGE PORN LAW AS AN EXAMPLE OF AN IRONCLAD PIECE OF LEGISLATION BUT SAYS THAT OTHERWISE THE FIELD IS ??SPLIT? BETWEEN EFFECTIVE AND INEFFECTIVE LAWS. ??THESE CASES SHOULD BE VERY EASY TO PROSECUTE BECAUSE THE DISTRIBUTION IS THE PROOF? SHE SAID. ??THE FACT THAT THE IMAGES ARE ON THE INTERNET IS THE PROOF OF THE CRIME.? BUT THEY CAN PROVE CHALLENGING NONETHELESS. IF THE VICTIM AND THE OFFENDER LIVE IN DIFFERENT STATES FOR EXAMPLE LAW ENFORCEMENT IN EACH STATE MAY AS GOLDBERG SAYS ??TELL HER TO REPORT IT TO THE OTHER STATE.? IF VICTIMS CAN??T GET REVENGE PORN LEGISLATION TO WORK IN THEIR FAVOR??OR IF NEITHER THEY NOR THE OFFENDER LIVE IN A STATE WHERE THESE LAWS APPLY??LITIGATORS STILL HAVE OTHER OPTIONS. IN ADDITION TO PURSUING CIVIL ACTION REVENGE PORN MAY OFTEN INVOLVE OTHER RELATED CRIMES THAT CAN BE CRIMINALLY PROSECUTED. ??IF [THE VICTIM] DOES NOT LIVE IN A STATE WHERE THERE IS A REVENGE PORN LAW THERE MAY BE OTHER LAWS THAT WERE BROKEN? GOLDBERG EXPLAINED. WERE THE PICTURES TAKEN WITHOUT CONSENT? THAT COULD BE COVERED UNDER UNLAWFUL SURVEILLANCE LAW SAYS GOLDBERG. IS THE VICTIM UNDERAGE? CHILD PORN LAWS WOULD LIKELY APPLY. IS THE OFFENDER STALKING HARASSING OR THREATENING THE VICTIM? THAT CAN BE REPORTED TOO. IN MANY INSTANCES A VICTIM CAN ALSO SEEK A RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST THE OFFENDER AND TAKE ACTION IF HE VIOLATES IT. ??FRANKLY I AS A CIVIL LAWYER DON??T HAVE THE PATIENCE TO WAIT FOR EVERY STATE TO PASS LAWS? GOLDBERG TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. ??IT IS A SPACE WHERE THERE IS NO PLAYBOOK. WE??RE CREATING THE METHODS AS WE GO ALONG.? ABOVE ALL GOLDBERG TELLS VICTIMS TO GET IN TOUCH WITH ERP RIGHT AWAY SO THAT THEY CAN UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE NOT ALONE AND THAT THIS NIGHTMARE IS NOT THEIR FAULT. ??WE DEAL WITH VICTIMS OF PRIVACY INVASION AND THIS FORM OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE ALL DAY EVERY DAY? SHE SAID. ??AND VICTIMS LIKELY DON??T KNOW ANYBODY ELSE WHO??S DEALING WITH THIS. IT CAN BE A VERY ISOLATING MISERABLE EXPERIENCE SO IT??S IMPORTANT THAT THEY GET IN TOUCH WITH SUPPORT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.? ,11542.0

PROBABLY BECAUSE THEY WERE GOVERNED BY APARTHEID AT THE TIME ???Ÿ NELSON MANDELA BELIEVED IT WAS A NECESSARY DOCUMENT FOR THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF SOUTH AFRICA AFTER THE ABOLISHMENT OF APARTHEID.? ACCORDING TO SOUTH AFRICAN HOME AFFAIRS OFFICIALS BEY HAD 14 DAYS TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY. BUT IN A FRUSTRATED AUDIO MESSAGE POSTED ON HIS LONGTIME FRIEND KANYE WEST??S OFFICIAL WEBSITE HE SAYS HE WAS HELD ??UNLAWFULLY.? AN EMOTIONAL-SOUNDING YASIIN KICKS A FREESTYLE CALLED ??NO MORE PARTIES IN S.A.? OVER THE PHONE BEFORE OFFERING HIS VERSION OF WHAT??S GOING ON. ??THIS IS YASIIN BEY. AT THIS PRESENT TIME I AM CURRENTLY IN CAPETOWN SA. I??M BEING PREVENTED FROM LEAVING UNJUSTLY UNLAWFULLY AND WITHOUT ANY LOGICAL REASON? HE SAYS. ??THEY??RE SAYING THAT THEY WANT TO DEPORT MY FAMILY. THEY ARE MAKING FALSE CLAIMS AGAINST ME SOME OF THESE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS EVEN IN THE PRESS ARE MAKING FALSE CLAIMS AGAINST ME. SAYING THAT MY TRAVEL DOCUMENT THAT I WAS TRAVELING WITH IS FICTITIOUS. IT??S NOT. ANYONE CAN DO RESEARCH ON A WORLD PASSPORT IT??S NOT A FICTITIOUS DOCUMENT. IT??S NOT DESIGNED TO DECEIVE OR ROB ANY BENEFIT FROM THE STATE. IN FACT THE WORLD PASSPORT HAS BEEN ACCEPTED HERE ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS.? BEY CONTINUES TO VOICE HIS FRUSTRATIONS WITH HOW HE AND HIS FAMILY HAVE BEEN TREATED THROUGHOUT THE MESSAGE. ??I AM NOT A LIAR. I??VE MADE NO FALSE CLAIMS. I HAVE NOT MISREPRESENTED MYSELF. I??M UNDER UNNECESSARY STATE SUPERVISION AND SCRUTINY.? IN 2013 BEY TEAMED WITH THE HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP REPRIEVE AND RELEASED A VIDEO REENACTMENT OF A FORCE-FEEDING SIMILAR TO THE ONES ENDURED BY HUNGER STRIKERS JAILED IN GUANTANAMO BAY. HE ALSO SPOKE ABOUT THE SERENITY HE??D FOUND LIVING IN SOUTH AFRICA. ??I LIVED IN BROOKLYN 33 YEARS OF MY LIFE. I THOUGHT I'D BE BURIED IN THAT PLACE\ HE TOLD ROLLING STONE THAT SAME YEAR. \""AROUND SEVEN YEARS AGO I WAS LIKE YOU KNOW 'I GOTTA GO I GOTTA LEAVE.' IT'S VERY HARD TO LEAVE. AND I LIVED IN A LOT OF PLACES. CENTRAL AMERICA. NORTH AMERICA. EUROPE FOR A WHILE. \""AND I CAME TO CAPE TOWN IN 2009 AND IT JUST HIT ME. I WAS LIKE 'YEAH.?? I KNOW WHEN A GOOD VIBE GETS TO YOU.

BACK.'\"" \""FOR A GUY LIKE ME WHO HAD FIVE OR SIX GENERATIONS NOT JUST IN AMERICA BUT IN ONE TOWN IN AMERICA TO LEAVE AMERICA THINGS GOTTA BE NOT SO GOOD WITH AMERICA\"" HE SAID. IN 2014 BEY WAS FORCED TO CANCEL A U.S. TOUR DUE TO ??IMMIGRATION ISSUES.? AN OFFICIAL STATEMENT FROM BOSTON??S TOGETHER MUSIC FESTIVAL EXPLAINED: ??WE REGRET TO INFORM YOU THAT DUE TO IMMIGRATION/LEGAL ISSUES YASIIN BEY IS UNABLE TO ENTER BACK INTO THE UNITED STATES AND HIS UPCOMING US TOUR HAS BEEN CANCELED.\"" IN YESTERDAY??S MESSAGE YASIIN BEY MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE FEELS HE??S BEING TARGETED. ??I HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE OR SUSPECT THAT THERE ARE POLITICAL MOTIVATIONS BEHIND THE WAY THAT I??M BEING TREATED BECAUSE THIS IS FOLLOWING NO REASONABLE STRAIN OF LOGIC? HE WEARILY STATED. ??AND IT??S CURIOUS. I HAVEN??T BROKEN ANY LAW AND I AM BEING TREATED LIKE A CRIMINAL. I KNOW THAT I??M NOT UNIQUE IN THAT REGARD AND I??M GRATEFUL THAT I??M HERE WITH MY FAMILY AND I HAVEN??T BEEN PHYSICALLY HARMED OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. HOWEVER I HAVE BEEN DETAINED AND PEOPLE IN THIS STATE HAVE TAKEN PUNITIVE ACTION AGAINST ME. UNNECESSARILY.? ALL I SEEK IS TO LEAVE THIS STATE. I??M NOT LOOKING TO STAKE ANY FUTURE CLAIMS AGAINST THEM FOR DAMAGES OR NONE OF THAT. PEOPLE CAN KEEP THE LITTLE STATE JOBS THEY??RE CONCERNED ABOUT LOSING.? ??THE STATE OF SOUTH AFRICA IS INTERFERING WITH MY ABILITY TO MOVE OR EVEN FULFILL MY PROFESSIONAL OBLIGATIONS. WE DON??T HAVE TO BE ENEMIES AND WE DON??T HAVE TO BE FRIENDS EITHER? HE CONTINUED. ??WE DON??T HAVE TO BE HERE. WE??RE COMPLYING IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY REASONABLY. JUST TODAY STATE OFFICIALS VISITED MY DOMICILE ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT ME AND MY FAMILY AND THEY HAD NO LEGAL RIGHT TO DO SO.? BEFORE SIGNING OFF WITH A ??THANK YOU? TO HIS FRIENDS AND SUPPORTERS INCLUDING WEST TALIB KWELI Q-TIP AND THE ZULU NATION BEY ALSO MADE THE UNEXPECTED ANNOUNCEMENT THAT HE WAS DONE WITH MUSIC AND FILM. ??I??M RETIRING FROM THE MUSIC RECORDING INDUSTRY AS IT IS CURRENTLY ASSEMBLED TODAY AND ALSO FROM HOLLYWOOD EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY? HE SAID. ??I??M RELEASING MY FINAL ALBUM THIS YEAR AND THAT??S THAT. PEACE TO ALL. FEAR OF NONE. ??ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUPPORTED ME THIS IS NO REFLECTION ON YOU? HE SHARED. ??I LOVE THE PEOPLE OF THIS CONTINENT. I LOVE THIS COUNTRY. BUT I??M NOT GOING TO SIT IDLY BY AND BE PERSECUTED BY THE STATE.? IF THE ARTIST FORMERLY KNOWN AS MOS DEF REALLY IS DONE??DONE WITH MAKING MUSIC AND FILM DONE WITH VOICING HIS CREATIVITY FOR THE PUBLIC DONE WITH CONTRIBUTING TO THE LANDSCAPE OF HIP-HOP??THEN WE SHOULD ALL BE SADDENED. WE SHOULD BE SADDENED THAT AN INDUSTRY ISN??T MORE CONDUCIVE TO NURTURING THE BEST OF OUR CREATORS. WE SHOULD BE SADDENED THAT A CULTURE STIFLED THAT CREATIVITY TO THE POINT THAT HE HAD TO SEEK PEACE VIA NOMADIC EXISTENCE. WE SHOULD BE SADDENED THAT AN ART FORM DIDN??T VALUE HIM MORE. AND WE SHOULD DO AS MUCH AS WE CAN TO ENSURE THAT THIS GENERATION OF HIGH-PROFILE BLACK CREATIVES DON??T GET SO FRUSTRATED WITH THE INDUSTRY AND THEIR AUDIENCE THAT THEY TOO DECIDE THE BEST SOLUTION IS TO WALK AWAY. WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN IN THE LATE ??90S I THOUGHT OF MOS DEF SIMILARLY TO THE WAY A GENERATION OF HIP-HOP FANS VIEW KENDRICK LAMAR NOW. HE WAS PASSIONATE AND THOUGHTFUL HE COULD RHYME HIS ASS OFF AND BLACK ON BOTH SIDES WAS AN ALBUM THAT BLEW ME AWAY FROM THE VERY FIRST LISTEN. I WOULD START MY DAYS WITH ??UMI SAYS? PLAYING IN THE BACKGROUND AND RIDE TO WORK BLASTING ??MS. FAT BOOTY? AND ??MATHEMATICS.? MOS DEF BECAME QUIETER AND QUIETER IN HIP-HOP AS YEARS PASSED SEEMINGLY FINDING MORE SOLACE IN ACTING AND ACTIVISM. AS A NEW GENERATION OF THOUGHTFUL EMCEES HAS EMERGED MAYBE THE WEIGHT OF YASIIN BEY WALKING AWAY WON??T BE IMMEDIATELY FELT. MAYBE HE??D BEEN GONE FOR A LONG TIME ALREADY AND THIS JUST MADE IT OFFICIAL. WE DON??T KNOW ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED AND IS HAPPENING TO HIM AS HE EMBARKS ON HIS UNORTHODOX PERSONAL JOURNEY AND IT MAY NOT BE FOR US TO KNOW. BUT CONTEMPORARY BLACK CULTURE IS BETTER WHEN MOS DEF IS A PART OF IT. HERE??S HOPING YASIIN BEY FINDS HIS WAY HOME. """,26342.0

BAXTER AND OTHER WOMEN AS HE PARLAYED HIS OWN LIFE OF CRIME??THE GENTLEMAN IS A DEVIL MRS. BAXTER SAID THOUGH OF WHAT SHAPE AND DEVILRY WE KNOW NOT YET. THE STOUT AND EVEN MORE GOODLY MR. MOLESLEY QUOTED EDMUND BURKE AT MRS. BAXTER TO ENCOURAGE HER TO OPEN HER BOUCHE TO THE AUTHORITIES ??ALL THAT IS NECESSARY FOR THE TRIUMPH OF EVIL IS THAT GOOD MEN DO NOTHING.? MY FAVORITE LINE WAS MRS. BATES WHO TO HER HUSBAND NOTED OF THE POLICE VISIT THAT IT MADE ??A NICE CHANGE? IT WASN??T FOR ONE OF THEM??IT HAS NOW BEEN NEARLY A MONTH SINCE ONE WASN??T CHARGED WRONGFULLY WITH MURDER. A DOWNTON RECORD. BRANSON WAS BANGING ON ABOUT HIS BIG TAKE-HOME FROM AMERICA WHERE ??THE HARD-WORKING MAN CAN GO RIGHT TO THE TOP? AND HOW STUFFY AND UNMERITOCRATIC BRITAIN WAS IN COMPARISON??BUT NOT FOR LONG IT WAS POSITED. DOWNTON SURE IS PACKED WITH SPOOKILY ACCURATE CRYSTAL BALLS WHILE BRANSON??S NEWLY NEUTERED CLASS CONSCIOUSNESS WAS AS IF THE VERY-LEFTY JEREMY CORBYN HAD BANGED HIS HEAD AND WOKEN UP SPOUTING THE MERITS OF THATCHER-ERA CLASS MOBILITY. ANOTHER SUDDEN IF TEMPORARY RISE DOWNSTAIRS: BARROW WAS RELISHING BEING MR. CARSON WHILE THE LATTER WAS ON HIS HONEYMOON ORDERING THE STAFF ABOUT AND ENJOYING THEM STANDING FOR HIM WHEN HE ENTERED THE ROOM. HE DIDN??T WANT MOLESLEY OR BAXTER??S PITY TWO WHO CAN SEE THROUGH HIS VICIOUS FACADE. THIS EPISODE OF CLASS CONFLICT WAS EXACERBATED BY DAISY??S GRATING GRIPING ON BEHALF OF MR. MASON WHO SHE WANTS TO TAKE OVER THE LEASE OF THAT FARM ON THE GROUNDS. DAISY WAS CONVINCED LADY GRANTHAM HAD BETRAYED HER. ??YOU COULDN??T BE HARDER ON THOSE POTATOES IF YOU HAD ACCUSED THEM OF SPYING? MRS. PATMORE THE COOK NOTED. AND OF COURSE THE ENDLESS WHO SHOULD RUN THE HOSPITAL SAGA DRONED ON TO NO CONCLUSION BUT A FEW ENTERTAINING SPARRING MATCHES OVER DRINKS WITH ADDED HENRY TALBOT ACTION. HE??S BACK TO WANLY SEDUCE LADY MARY. HIS PALLID SEDUCTION ROUTINE IS STRANGE BECAUSE HE IS QUITE HOT AND ALSO ALLEGEDLY A RACE CAR DRIVER. (LADY MARY HAD TO TELL TALBOT TO FLIRT WITH HER AT A LONDON CLUB: COME ON MAN!) HE WAS WITH HIS AUNT LADY SHACKLETON WHO SAID SHE WOULD NOT TAKE SIDES BETWEEN ISABEL AND VIOLET OVER THE HOSPITAL (SENSIBLE MOVE) AND WHETHER IT SHOULD REMAIN LOCAL AND SELF-OPERATING OR BECOME PART OF THE BIGGER HEALTH AUTHORITY. (CAN I BEAR TO SKETCH THIS PLOT KNOT ENDLESSLY? I CANNOT. NEXT WEEK I WILL SAY IT IS ABOUT OWLS.) LADY MARY THOUGHT IT ODD TALBOT WAS A RACE CAR DRIVER BUT THEN PEOPLE DID SUCH ODD JOBS SHE SAID SHE HAD MET A MAN WHO IMPORTED GUINEA PIGS FROM PERU. LORD GRANTHAM??S STOMACH IS STILL RUMBLING MENACINGLY SETTING UP EITHER A STORYLINE INVOLVING A GIGANTIC TAPEWORM OR HE??S COOKING UP AN ALIEN-STYLE CREATURE IN THERE. GWEN THE SERVANT WHO??LONGTIME FANS WILL REMEMBER??SYBIL HAD HELPED TO BECOME A SECRETARY CAME BACK TO DOWNTON THE WIFE OF JOHN HARDING ??A SELF-MADE MAN.? THIS THEME OF ESCAPING ONE??S PAST AND SHAPING ONE??S FUTURE AND DESTINY WAS CRYSTALLIZED BY HER ARRIVAL. THE SERVANTS KNEW HER OF COURSE BUT NOW SHE WAS AN ??UPSTAIRS?? GUEST??THEY PREDICTED CORRECTLY NO-ONE WOULD RECOGNIZE HER BECAUSE THEY DON??T LOOK AT SERVANTS IN THE FACE. (THAT WAS PIERCING EVEN IF DOWNTON IS FULL OF SUCH INTRIGUES EVERYONE??S ALWAYS LOOKING SAT EACH OTHER??S FACE.) BRANSON RECOGNIZED HER OF COURSE AND HER BELIEF IN BETTERING HERSELF AND UPSETTING THE ORDER IN THE BEST WAY IS SHARED BY HIM. GWEN SPOKE PASSIONATELY AND TO THE SUPPORT OF THE DOWNTON SISTERHOOD ABOUT THE NEED TO EDUCATE WOMEN UNTIL BARROW ON MAXIMUM EVIL INFORMED EVERYONE SHE HAD BEEN A HOUSEMAID. LADY MARY BRIDLED (WHY? PLOT CONVENIENCE MAYBE??IT MADE NO SENSE) WHILE EVERYONE ELSE APPLAUDED HER FOR HER ADVANCEMENT IN LIFE (LADY EDITH SAID THE ARISTOS HAD BEEN IN THE WRONG FOR NEVER ADDRESSING HER PROPERLY WHILE WAS THERE). BATES CASTIGATED BARROW AND TOLD HIM HE WAS JEALOUS WHICH IS WHY HE HAD SET OUT TO HUMILIATE GWEN. GWEN TOLD THE CRAWLEYS OF THE NOW-DEAD SYBIL??S KINDNESS AND IN YET ANOTHER CLASS-CROSSING VISIT DOWNSTAIRS DAISY AGAIN PLEADED FOR MR. MASON WITH BRANSON. LORD CRAWLEY TOLD BARROW HE DIDN??T CARE FOR HIS ??LACK OF GENEROSITY.? LATER HE TOLD BARROW PEOPLE WERE LOYAL TO CARSON BECAUSE HE WAS KIND??AND TO THINK ABOUT THAT AS HIS OWN HOUR TO LEAVE DOWNTON APPROACHETH. BARROW WASN??T BEING A TOTAL ASSHOLE: HE WONDERED TO BAXTER WHAT HE WAS DOING ANY MORE BAXTER SAID THEY WERE ALL TRYING TO GET THROUGH LIFE AS BEST THEY COULD. HE TOLD HER SHE WAS STRONGER THAN SHE THOUGHT. AND THAT HE WASN??T IMPERVIOUS TO EVERYONE??S DISAPPROVAL: HE CARED WHAT PEOPLE SAID ABOUT HIM. BAXTER FEELS ??RUINED? BECAUSE OF HER THIEVERY MOLESLEY TRIED TO TELL HER THE EXPERIENCE HAD MADE HER STRONGER. ??YOU ARE YOUR OWN WORST ENEMY? BAXTER TOLD BARROW. ??IF I AM I??VE GOT COMPETITION? BARROW RETORTED QUITE RIGHTLY. IT REALLY WAS ZINGER CENTRAL IN DOWNTON SUNDAY.

WISHES ARE NOTHING.? THE MAGNA CARTA PROTECTED GREAT FAMILIES SHE ADDED. VIOLET??S ERUPTION OF GARBLED SOUNDS AT PEOPLE DISAGREEING WITH HER WAS AN ALL-TOO AUDIBLE SIGNAL OF HER DISTRESS AT CHANGE AND THINGS NOT GOING HER WAY. GIVEN EVEN A SLITHER OF HAPPINESS FOR HER MUST ALWAYS BE IMPERILED MRS. BATES GOT AN ACHE ??DOWN THERE?? LEADING TO A CONVOLUTED TRIP TO LONDON TO THE HARLEY STREET DOCTOR TO CHECK IF SHE WAS MISCARRYING THE BABY SHE THOUGHT SHE COULDN??T CARRY ANYWAY BUT SHE IS AND HADN??T YET TOLD MR. BATES ABOUT. SHE WASN??T MISCARRYING AND WHEN MR. BATES REALIZED SHE WAS UP THE DUFF THEY WERE HAPPY AND HUGGED. THEY WERE HAPPY. WE LEFT MR. AND MRS. BATES HAPPY IN AN EPISODE OF DOWNTON ABBEY. HOW LONG CAN THIS LAST? HOW LONG CAN WE STAND IT? GWEN??S VISIT SET OFF A BOUT OF EVERYONE THINKING WHAT THEIR LIVES HAD BECOME AND BEEN ABOUT EVEN LADY MARY. IN THE END BRANSON AND CORA DECIDED MR. MASON COULD HAVE THE FARM EVEN THOUGH IT MADE NO FINANCIAL SENSE. IT WAS AS CREATOR JULIAN FELLOWES EMPHASIZES IN EVERY STORY THE RIGHT THING TO DO. DAISY ALMOST PICKED A CAREER-ENDING WORKER-UPRISING THEMED FIGHT WITH CORA BEFORE REALIZING ALL THIS??BUT LUCKILY DID NOT AND MIGHT BE THE SUBJECT OF THE AFFECTIONS OF THE HOT JUNIOR BUTLER BARROW FANCIES A CITY BOY WHO WANTS A NEW LIFE IN THE COUNTRY. MR. MASON TOLD HER HE WAS ??AT THE GATES OF PARADISE? AT HIS NEW FARM THANKFUL TO DAISY FOR ??RESCUING? HIM. GOODNESS EVEN AS ANNOYINGLY AS DAISY??S IS VOCALIZED IS ALWAYS REPAID IN THIS VERY MORAL UNIVERSE. VIOLET WAS NOT HAPPY ABOUT HAVING TO GO DOWNSTAIRS FOR THE GREAT MR. AND MRS.

NOT A SHOCK: WHEN COUSIN ROSALIND SAID THAT HAD BEEN SWEET LADY MARY SNEERED: ??A MONKEY WILL TYPE OUT THE BIBLE IF YOU LEAVE IT LONG ENOUGH.? PHEW THAT DETENTE HAD LASTED ALL OF EIGHT SECONDS: WEEK IN WEEK OUT JULIAN FELLOWES??

1165,10284059.0,2016-01-26T05:01:00+00:00,CAN BERNIE SANDERS BREAK HILLARY CLINTON??S SOUTH CAROLINA FIREWALL?,BEFORE YOU ASK IF BERNIE SANDERS CAN WIN THE WHITE HOUSE BEFORE YOU ASK IF HE CAN TOPPLE DONALD TRUMP OR TED CRUZ BEFORE YOU WONDER IF HE CAN ACTUALLY BEAT HILLARY CLINTON YOU MUST ASK YOURSELF THIS: CAN SANDERS WIN SOUTH CAROLINA? IF THAT ANSWER IS ??NO??ŸTHEN SANDERS SHOULD FOLD HIS TENT GO HOME AND BE CONTENT WITH LEVERAGING HIS CONSIDERABLE BASE OF SUPPORT TO EFFECTIVELY ??MOVE? HILLARY CLINTON TO THE ??LEFT? ON KEY ISSUES. SOUTH CAROLINA IS THE FOURTH STATE ON THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY CALENDAR AND ARGUABLY CARRIES MORE WEIGHT THAN THE PRECEDING CONTESTS COMBINED. UNLIKE IOWA OR NEW HAMPSHIRE THE PALMETTO STATE PRIMARY RACE IS 56 PERCENT BLACK. WHILE IT??S TRUE THAT NEVADA ALSO BOASTS A MORE DIVERSE ELECTORATE WITH HISPANICS REPRESENTING ABOUT 28 PERCENT OF THE NEVADA POPULATION TURNOUT MAY PROVE ANEMIC. MILLENNIALS MAKE UP ALMOST HALF OF THE LATINO VOTE IN 2016 AND ARE BELIEVED TO BE AMONG THE LEAST RELIABLE TO SHOW UP ON ELECTION DAY. IN A STATE WHERE UNIONS ARE CRUCIAL WHITE WORKING-CLASS VOTERS STILL RULE THE DAY. THEN TOO THE SAGEBRUSH STATE IS HOME TERRITORY FOR SEN. HARRY REID WHOSE POLITICS MORE CLOSELY ALIGN WITH CLINTON THAN SANDERS. IN OTHER WORDS DON??T LOOK FOR A PROGRESSIVE REVOLUTION IN NEVADA. THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS RUN THE CALCULUS AND CLEARLY UNDERSTANDS THE MATH. DONORS WON??T LIKE IT AND VOLUNTEERS MAY BE DISHEARTENED BUT LOSING IOWA AND/ OR NEW HAMPSHIRE WOULDN??T BREAK THE BACK OF THE CAMPAIGN. HOWEVER LOSING SOUTH CAROLINA WOULD DEMAND A FULL-SCALE RE-SET AT A TIME WHEN TEAM CLINTON CAN LEAST AFFORD IT. THUS SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES ARE BEING POURED INTO THE STATE TO CREATE A ??FIREWALL.? THE ODDS ARE CERTAINLY IN HER FAVOR AT THIS POINT. TO WIN A RACE DOWN SOUTH IN THE CLINTON HOMELAND SANDERS MUST BROADEN HIS ALREADY SIZEABLE COALITION. DOING SO MEANS SHORING UP SUPPORT AMONG AFRICAN AMERICANS??A GROUP THAT NOT ONLY CONSISTENTLY VOTES DEMOCRAT BUT ALSO RARELY SPLITS AMONG CANDIDATES IN ANY STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT WAY. AS A VOTING BLOC WE TEND TO UNITE BEHIND A SINGLE CONTENDER. IT SHOULD BE SAID THAT THE SANDERS CAMPAIGN HAS SET OUT TO DEFY CONVENTIONAL WISDOM AND HAS DEVELOPED WHAT ONE SENIOR SOUTH CAROLINA DEMOCRATIC CALLED A ??STUNNINGLY STRONG GROUND OPERATION.? IN RECENT DAYS STATE REPRESENTATIVE JUSTIN BAMBERG SWITCHED HIS SUPPORT TO SANDERS AFTER FIRST BACKING CLINTON. BAMBERG IS THE FAMILY LAWYER FOR WALTER SCOTT THE 50-YEAR-OLD MOTORIST WHO WAS KILLED BY OFFICER MICHAEL SLAGER LAST SPRING. IN THE RUN-UP TO THE LATE FEBRUARY PRIMARY OTHERS ARE EXPECTED TO JOIN THE RANKS AND FORMALLY ENDORSE SANDERS. AND IT WAS ONLY WEEKS AGO THAT STATE SENATOR MARLON KIMPSON SPOKE PROUDLY OF SANDERS?? SUPPORT FOR COMPREHENSIVE GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION THE LAWMAKER SPONSORED IN THE WAKE OF THE EMANUEL AME CHURCH MASSACRE. SANDERS WHO WAS ONCE MOCKED ON SOCIAL MEDIA WITH THE HASHTAG #BERNIESOBLACK HAS SPENT RECENT MONTHS MEETING WITH KEY INFLUENCERS IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY. IN THE WAKE OF #BLACKLIVESMATTER PROTESTS THAT INTERRUPTED HIS SPEECH AT THE 2015 NETROOTS NATION CONVENTION SANDERS RE-TOOLED HIS EFFORTS AND HAS BEGUN TO TALK ABOUT RACE STRAIGHT-ON RATHER THAN SIMPLY RELYING ON ECONOMIC ARGUMENTS. IT??S PROVEN A DIFFICULT HABIT TO BREAK BUT THESE DAYS SANDERS TALKS LESS ABOUT HIS HISTORY OF MARCHING WITH DR. MARTIN L. KING AND MORE ABOUT PERSISTENT INEQUITIES IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. HE HAS OFFERED A COMPREHENSIVE PLATFORM ON RACIAL JUSTICE THAT ADDRESS POLICING IN NON-WHITE COMMUNITIES MASS INCARCERATION VOTING RIGHTS ECONOMIC DISPARITIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. PRINCETON UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR CORNEL WEST FORMER OHIO STATE SENATE MINORITY WHIP NINA TURNER AND RAPPER KILLER MIKE HAVE ALL JOINED HIM ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. WILL THAT BE ENOUGH? PROBABLY NOT. HEADING INTO THE FEBRUARY 27 PRIMARY CLINTON IS THOUGHT TO HOLD AN INSURMOUNTABLE LEAD AMONG BLACK VOTERS WHO FAVOR HER OVER SANDERS BY A FOUR-TO-ONE MARGIN. IT??S WORTH NOTING THAT SHE WAS BEATING THEN SEN. BARACK OBAMA IN THE POLLS BY DOUBLE IN 2008 BUT LOST SOUTH CAROLINA IN A STUNNING UPSET. SOME BELIEVED THAT THE RACIAL TENSIONS THAT ERUPTED DURING THAT STATE CONTEST AND PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON??S CRIME BILL AND WELFARE REFORM POLICIES WOULD HURT CLINTON THIS YEAR. THAT HASN??T PANNED OUT IN ANY MEASURABLE WAY AND IF IT HAD NO OTHER CANDIDATE HAS BEEN ABLE TO EXPLOIT THAT WEAKNESS. THAT SAID ANY COMPARISON BETWEEN SANDERS AND OBAMA??AS CANDIDATES AND AS LEADERS OF THEIR RESPECTIVE MOVEMENTS??IS FOOL??S GOLD. THERE WERE MANY FACTORS AT PLAY BUT NONE GREATER THAN THIS: PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD HISTORY ON HIS SIDE. BLACK SOUTH CAROLINIANS NOT ONLY LIKED WHAT THEY HEARD BUT ALSO WHO THEY WERE HEARING IT FROM. FOR THEM HE WAS KINFOLK. HE??S MORE LIKE YOUR MOTHER??S BROTHER-IN-LAW THAT YOU JUST MET AT THE FAMILY REUNION. BUT SANDERS HAS DONE A BETTER THAN DECENT JOB FIRING UP YOUNG BLACK VOTERS. HE??S BECOME HIP HOP??S FAVORITE OLD WHITE DUDE AND FOR THE FIRST TIME SOME ARE STRONGLY CONSIDERING HIS CANDIDACY. HE??S NOW CLOCKING IN AT 30 PERCENT IN SOUTH CAROLINA HAVING STARTED THE RACE THERE IN THE SINGLE DIGITS. CERTAINLY IOWA NEW HAMPSHIRE AND NEVADA REMAIN IMPORTANT FOR SANDERS IN TERMS OF MAINTAINING THE MOMENTUM HE CURRENTLY ENJOYS. HOWEVER HE MUST PROVE ONCE AND FOR ALL THAT HE IS A CREDIBLE CANDIDATE FOR THE NOMINATION AND FOR THE GENERAL ELECTION??AND THAT MEANS WINNING A SUBSTANTIAL SHARE OF AFRICAN AMERICAN VOTERS. THAT COULD MAKE SOUTH CAROLINA A SHOWSTOPPER. THE WINNER THERE??WHETHER CLINTON OR SANDERS??IS LIKELY TO WALK AWAY WITH THE NOMINATION. ,9671.0

1075,10227213.0,2016-01-24T05:01:00+00:00,DEAR ATHEISTS: DON??T FEAR ??IN GOD WE TRUST',THIS?ŸMONTH A SACRAMENTO BASED EMERGENCY-ROOM DOCTOR FILED A FEDERAL LAWSUIT SEEKING TO REMOVE ALL REFERENCES TO GOD FROM US CURRENCY. IN HIS LAWSUIT MICHAEL NEWDOW ARGUES THAT THE MOTTO ??IN GOD WE TRUST? PLACES A ??SUBSTANTIAL BURDEN? ON ATHEISTS. IN A STATEMENT THAT MIGHT SEEM IRONIC NEWDOW ARGUES THAT IT IS BURDENSOME FOR ATHEISTS ??TO PERSONALLY BEAR A RELIGIOUS MESSAGE THAT IS THE ANTITHESIS OF WHAT THEY CONSIDER TO BE RELIGIOUS TRUTH.? THIS ISN??T NEWDOW??S FIRST FORAY INTO RELIGIOUS FREEDOM LEGISLATION. IN 2004 HE GAINED NOTORIETY FOR HIS ATTEMPT TO REMOVE THE PHRASE ??UNDER GOD? FROM THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE. IT??S NOT EVEN HIS FIRST ATTEMPT TO ALTER US CURRENCY: TEN YEARS AGO HE UNSUCCESSFULLY ARGUED IN FRONT OF A FEDERAL JUDGE THAT ITS USE AMOUNTS TO A RELIGIOUS AFFIRMATION. THE USE OF THE PHRASE ??IN GOD WE TRUST? IN US CURRENCY FIRST APPEARED IN 1864. SALMON P. CHASE LINCOLN??S SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CIVIL WAR RECEIVED A LETTER FROM A PENNSYLVANIAN MINISTER REQUESTING SOME RECOGNITION OF GOD IN A NATIONAL MOTTO. THE PHRASE FOUND ITS WAY ONTO ALL US CURRENCY IN THE THICK OF THE COLD WAR (AROUND THE SAME TIME AND FOR THE SAME REASONS THAT ??UNDER GOD? WAS ADDED TO THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE). AS PART OF THE?ŸCULTURAL WAR ON GODLESS COMMUNISM A 1955 CONGRESSIONAL VOTE ELECTED TO PLACE THE MOTTO ON ALL US MONEY. CERTAINLY IN SOME RESPECTS NEWDOW IS CORRECT TO SEE THE MOTTO AS A MODERN INNOVATION. IF REMOVING RELIGIOUS AFFILIATIONS FROM US CURRENCY IS THE GOAL YOU HAVE TO WONDER IF NEWDOW HAS MISSED THE 100-POUND TRUNCATED PYRAMID IN THE ROOM. THE FAIRLY INNOCUOUS PHRASE ??IN GOD WE TRUST? IS FAR LESS SPECIFIC THAN THE OCCULT IMAGERY THAT CURRENTLY ADORNS THE COMMON ONE DOLLAR BILL. THE MOST PROMINENT ICONOGRAPHY ON THE $1 ARE THE EAGLE AND THE PYRAMID WHICH TOGETHER CONSTITUTE THE GREAT SEAL OF THE UNITED STATES. THE PYRAMID IS A THROWBACK TO ANCIENT EGYPT BUT IS IN MANY WAYS A MUCH TAMER VERSION OF THE SEAL THAT FRANKLIN AND JEFFERSON ENVISIONED. NOTED EGYPTOPHILES THE VERSION THAT THEY INITIALLY SUPPORTED INCLUDED AN EGYPTIAN PHARAOH SEATED ON A CHARIOT AND PASSING THROUGH THE PARTED WATERS OF THE RED SEA. THE MOTTO THEY PREFERRED WAS ??REBELLION TO TYRANTS IS OBEDIENCE TO GOD.? ANYONE FAMILIAR WITH THE BIBLICAL STORY OF THE PARTING OF THE RED SEA CAN HEAR THE THINLY VEILED THREAT. PHARAOH DOESN??T STAY ATOP THAT CHARIOT FOR LONG. FRANKLIN LOVED HIS VERSION OF THE SEAL SO MUCH THAT HE ADOPTED IT AS HIS PERSONAL MOTTO. AND TODAY THE CONSERVATIVE RIGHT IS FOND OF?ŸINVOKING FRANKLIN??S MOTTO IN POLITICAL DEBATES. THE FINAL DESIGN FOR THE GREAT SEAL WHICH WAS ACCEPTED BY CONGRESS IN 1782 WAS PRESENTED BY CHARLES THOMSON A PHILADELPHIA MERCHANT WHO FINALIZED THE DESIGN BY COMBINING THE IDEAS OF THREE SEPARATE COMMITTEES. THOMSON?ŸSAID THAT THE PYRAMID SYMBOLIZED ??STRENGTH AND DURATION? AND THAT THE LATIN INSCRIPTION ??NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM? (A NEW ORDER OF THE AGES) REFERRED TO A NEW FORM OF GOVERNMENT AND ??THE BEGINNING OF THE NEW AMERICAN ERA.? THE DISEMBODIED EYE THAT FLOATS ATOP THE PYRAMID HE ADDED WITH THE INSCRIPTIONS ??ANNUIT COEPTIS? REFERS TO THE WAYS IN WHICH PROVIDENCE FAVORED THE AMERICAN CAUSE. BUT OTHERS HAVE QUESTIONED THOMSON??S STRAIGHT-LACED EXPLANATION. THEY SEE THE MOTTOS AND SYMBOLISM OF THE SEAL AS EMBLEMS OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL SECRET SOCIETIES THE FREEMASONS AND THE ROSICRUCIANS. TODAY MEMBERSHIP IN THESE GROUPS IS AVAILABLE TO ALMOST ANYONE INTERESTED IN PAYING DUES BUT IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY THESE SECRET ORGANIZATIONS WERE OPEN ONLY TO THE INTELLECTUAL AND SOCIAL ELITE. FOR THOSE WHO SUBSCRIBE TO THE IDEA THAT OUR CURRENCY IS ORIGINALLY MASONIC THERE??S A LOT TO WORK WITH. MANY OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE MULTI-STEP DESIGN FOR THE SEAL (ALTHOUGH NOT THOMSON HIMSELF) ARE KNOWN MASONS. FOR THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN THE ??NEW WORLD ORDER? (THE IDEA THAT A SECRET POWERFUL ELITE IS CONTROLLING GLOBAL GOVERNMENT AND COMMERCE) THE FACT THAT THOSE VERY WORDS APPEAR ON OUR MONEY IS A BLATANT GIVEAWAY. THE ??ALL-SEEING EYE? PERCHED ABOVE THE PYRAMID IS A SYMBOL OF THE GREAT ARCHITECT OF THE UNIVERSE THE MASONIC EQUIVALENT OF A DEITY. FOR CONSPIRACY THEORISTS THE MASONIC IMAGERY GOES FURTHER. EVEN THE?ŸNUMBER OF FEATHERS ON THE EAGLE??S RIGHT WING (32) CAN BE SEEN AS CORRESPONDING TO THE NUMBER OF DEGREES IN SCOTTISH RITE FREEMASONARY. IF SUCH INTERPRETATIONS SEEM EXCESSIVE BEAR IN MIND THAT IN 1894 WHEN HE WAS INVITED TO CONSULT ON THE ADOPTION OF THE GREAT SEAL EMINENT HARVARD ART HISTORIAN ELIOT NORTON DISPARAGINGLY?ŸDESCRIBED IT AS A ??DULL EMBLEM OF A MASONIC FRATERNITY.? WHILE THE EXTENT OF FREEMASONRY??S INFLUENCE IN THE FOUNDING AND ESTABLISHMENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS WILDLY EXAGGERATED ALMOST EVERYONE CONCEDES THAT FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT AND HENRY WALLACE (THE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE) WERE FREEMASONS. AND IT DOES SEEM TO HAVE BEEN THE CASE THAT FOR THEM THE IMAGERY OF THE DOLLAR BILL WAS EVOCATIVE OF MASONIC PRINCIPLES. FOR WALLACE THE ??NEW WORLD ORDER? BECAME THE ??NEW DEAL.? IT??S EASY TO SEE WHY PEOPLE ARGUE THAT US CURRENCY IS REPLETE WITH ESOTERIC RELIGIOUS SYMBOLISM. AND YET ODDLY ATHEISTS ARE NOT SEEKING TO REMOVE THE EYE AND PYRAMID ON THE BASIS THAT THEY ARE EITHER FREEMASON OR ANCIENT EGYPTIAN SYMBOLS. OF COURSE THE USE OF RELIGIOUS IMAGERY AND SLOGANS IS NOTHING NEW. GREEK AND ROMAN COINS ROUTINELY INCLUDED PORTRAITS OR EMBLEMS OF EVERYONE FROM CUPID TO JUPITER. MAJOR CITIES LIKE ATHENS WOULD MINT COINS WITH THEIR CITY??S FAVORED DEITY (HERE OF COURSE ATHENA) ON THEM. MANY COINS EVEN HAD IMAGES OF TEMPLES ON THEM. IT WAS PRECISELY BECAUSE ROMAN CURRENCY DEPICTED THE EMPEROR AS A QUASI-DEITY THAT JEWS PROHIBITED ITS USE IN THE TEMPLE. THE USE OF RELIGIOUS IMAGERY CONTINUED THROUGHOUT THE BYZANTINE AND ROMAN PERIODS WHEN CROSSES REGULAR APPEARED ON COINS PRODUCED ALL OVER EUROPE. THERE??S NOTHING NEW ABOUT IMPRESSING YOUR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS ON YOUR COINAGE. THE SYMBOLISM ON THE DOLLAR BILL IS CERTAINLY EVOCATIVE OF SECRET SOCIETIES BUT EVEN CONTEMPORARY FREEMASONS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IMAGERY ON THE DOLLAR BILL RESONATES WITH OTHER TRADITIONS AS WELL. AS THOMAS M. SAVINI DIRECTOR OF THE LIBRARY AT THE NEW YORK GRAND LODGE HEADQUARTERS?ŸSAID IN 2006 ??WE USE THE EYE BUT OPTICIANS USE THE EYE. IT MAKES US LOOK RIDICULOUS IF WE SAY IT LINKS INTO SOME MASONIC CONNECTION THAT WAS NOT THERE.? A SIMILAR KIND OF AMBIGUITY SURROUNDS THE USE OF ??IN GOD WE TRUST.? IT BECAME UBIQUITOUS ONLY DURING THE COLD WAR AND COULD ALMOST BE CONSIDERED NATIONALISTIC PROPAGANDA. IT WAS ON THE BASIS THAT ??IN GOD WE TRUST? IS MORE SECULAR THAN RELIGIOUS THAT A FEDERAL JUDGE THREW OUT NEWDOW??S CASE TEN YEARS AGO. THOSE CONCERNED ABOUT THE RELIGIOUS MESSAGING (EITHER MAINSTREAM OR OCCULT) OF US CURRENCY HAVE OPTIONS. PERHAPS THEY SHOULD STICK TO CREDIT CARDS OR APPLE PAY. THE CULT OF APPLE MAY BE IDOLATROUS BUT IT??S NOT RELIGIOUS. NOT YET ANYWAY. ,27567.0

RICK SNYDER IN 2012 REJECTED USING THE CITY??S RIVER AS DRINKING WATER AFTER CONSULTING WITH THE STATE??S ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY. SNYDER APPOINTED ED KURTZ TO BE FLINT??S SECOND EMERGENCY MANAGER AND KURTZ SELECTED JERRY AMBROSE TO BE THE CITY??S CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER. BOTH MEN WERE TASKED BY THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR??S ADMINISTRATION WITH RESTRUCTURING THE CITY??S GOVERNMENT TO SAVE MONEY AFTER IT WAS IN DANGER OF BECOMING INSOLVENT. ONE COST-SAVING MEASURE CONSIDERED WAS TO QUIT BUYING MUNICIPAL WATER FROM DETROIT. IN A CIVIL DEPOSITION NOT REPORTED UNTIL NOW AMBROSE TESTIFIED UNDER OATH THAT EMERGENCY MANAGER KURTZ CONSIDERED A PROPOSAL TO USE THE FLINT RIVER DISCUSSED THE OPTION WITH THE MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY AND THEN REJECTED IT. IN 2014 AMBROSE WAS DEPOSED IN A CIVIL LAWSUIT BROUGHT BY RETIRED FLINT MUNICIPAL WORKERS AGAINST THE STATE OVER SEVERE CUTS TO THEIR HEALTH-CARE BENEFITS. ATTORNEY ALEC GIBBS QUESTIONED AMBROSE ABOUT THE WATER DECISION (A YEAR BEFORE FLINT LEARNED IT WAS BEING POISONED). ??THERE WAS BRIEF EVALUATION OF WHETHER THE CITY WOULD BE BETTER OFF TO SIMPLY USE THE FLINT RIVER AS ITS PRIMARY SOURCE OF WATER OVER THE LONG TERM? AMBROSE SAID. ??THAT WAS DETERMINED NOT TO BE FEASIBLE.? ??WHO DETERMINED IT WASN??T FEASIBLE?? GIBBS ASKED. ??IT WAS A COLLECTIVE DECISION OF THE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT TEAM BASED ON CONVERSATIONS WITH THE MDEQ THAT INDICATED THEY WOULD NOT BE SUPPORTIVE OF THE USE OF THE FLINT RIVER ON A LONG-TERM BASIS AS A PRIMARY SOURCE OF WATER? AMBROSE ANSWERED. ??WHAT WAS THE REASON THEY GAVE?? GIBBS ASKED. ??YOU??LL HAVE TO ASK THEM? AMBROSE SAID. HOW COULD THE RIVER THAT WAS REJECTED AS FLINT??S PERMANENT WATER SOURCE IN DECEMBER 2012 SUDDENLY BECOME SUITABLE FOR CONSUMPTION A MERE 16 MONTHS LATER? AND WHO ACTUALLY MADE THE DISASTROUS CHOICE TO START USING THE PREVIOUSLY REJECTED RIVER AS THE CITY??S TEMPORARY WATER SOURCE? HOWARD CROFT THE FORMER DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC WORKS FOR FLINT WHO RESIGNED IN NOVEMBER 2015 ASSERTED MORE THAN FOUR MONTHS AGO IN A VIDEOTAPED INTERVIEW WITH THE ACLU OF MICHIGAN THAT THE DECISION TO USE THE DANGEROUSLY CORROSIVE RIVER CAME DIRECTLY FROM THE SNYDER ADMINISTRATION. IN THE INTERVIEW CROFT SAID THAT THE DECISION TO USE THE RIVER WAS A FINANCIAL ONE WITH A REVIEW THAT ??WENT UP THROUGH THE STATE.? ??ALL THE WAY TO THE GOVERNOR??S OFFICE?? THE ACLU OF MICHIGAN ASKED HIM. ??ALL THE WAY TO THE GOVERNOR??S OFFICE? CROFT REPLIED. WHEN QUESTIONED ABOUT CROFT??S ACCUSATION IN OCTOBER SARA WURFEL SNYDER??S SPOKESWOMAN AT THE TIME OFFERED UP THE FALSE CLAIM THAT THE GOVERNOR COULD NOT HAVE MADE THE DECISION TO USE THE RIVER BECAUSE THE CITY HAD BEEN KICKED OFF OF DETROIT??S SYSTEM. ??THE DETROIT WATER AND SEWER DEPARTMENT AT THE TIME BACK LAST SPRING SAID ??HEY WE??RE GONNA CUT YOU OFF.??? THIS IS A LIE. IN A LETTER OBTAINED BY THE ACLU OF MICHIGAN (PDF) EMERGENCY MANAGER DARNELL EARLEY WROTE TO DWSD IN MARCH 2014: ??THANK YOU FOR THE CORRESPONDENCE THAT PROVIDES FLINT THE OPTION OF CONTINUING TO PURCHASE WATER FROM THE CITY OF DETROIT. ?? THE CITY OF FLINT HAS ACTIVELY PURSUED THE FLINT RIVER AS A TEMPORARY WATER SOURCE?? THERE WILL BE NO NEED FOR FLINT TO CONTINUE PURCHASING WATER TO SERVE ITS RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES AFTER APRIL 17 2014.? SNYDER DID NOT MENTION THIS LETTER IN THE HISTORY OF THE FLINT WATER CRISIS THAT HE PRESENTED IN HIS STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS LAST WEEK. ??FIRST THE CRISIS BEGAN IN SPRING 2013 WHEN THE FLINT CITY COUNCIL VOTED 7-1 TO BUY WATER FROM KAREGONDI WATER AUTHORITY [TO BE SUPPLIED BY LAKE HURON]. FORMER FLINT MAYOR WALLING SUPPORTED THE MOVE AND THE EMERGENCY MANAGER APPROVED THE PLAN. DWSD PROVIDED NOTICE OF TERMINATION TO BE EFFECTIVE ONE-YEAR LATER AND ON APRIL 25 2014 FLINT BEGAN USING WATER FROM THE FLINT RIVER AS ITS INTERIM SOURCE.? DETROIT DID TERMINATE A 50-YEAR CONTRACT BUT IT ALSO DILIGENTLY TRIED TO STRIKE A NEW DEAL TO KEEP SELLING FLINT CLEAN SAFE WATER. EARLEY REJECTED ALL OFFERS AND THEN SENT THAT ??THANKS BUT NO THANKS? LETTER TO DETROIT SAYING THAT THE DECISION HAD BEEN MADE TO USE THE FLINT RIVER. IF THE GOVERNOR REALLY WANTS TO COME CLEAN HE NEEDS TO START TELLING THE WHOLE TRUTH NOT JUST CONVENIENT PIECES OF IT. SNYDER TRIED TO CONVINCE THE PUBLIC AND THE PRESS HE WAS DOING THAT WHEN HE RELEASED EMAILS FROM 2014 AND 2015. (THERE WAS RICH SYMBOLIC IRONY IN THE FACT THAT THE FIRST MISSIVE POSTED FROM THE CACHE IS COMPLETELY REDACTED BLACKED OUT FROM START TO FINISH.) IF THERE WAS ANYTHING AT ALL REVELATORY IN THE EMAILS RELEASED SO FAR IT IS SNYDER??S ATTENTION TO DETAIL. THERE IS FOR EXAMPLE A JUNE 2015 EMAIL HE SENT OUT AFTER BEING LOOPED IN ON A POSITIVE TELEVISION REPORT ABOUT MICHIGAN STATE POLICE BIKE PATROLS MAKING THEIR DEBUT IN FLINT. ??GOOD WORK? WROTE THE GOVERNOR IN A MESSAGE SENT TO HIS TEAM. ??LET ME KNOW HOW THINGS ARE GOING IN OUR CITIES. HOPEFULLY WE WON??T HAVE SIGNIFICANT SUMMER ISSUES.? AS THE WORLD NOW KNOWS A SLOW-BUILDING SCANDAL INVOLVING THE LEAD CONTAMINATION OF THE CITY??S WATER SUPPLY FIRST CAME TO LIGHT THE FOLLOWING MONTH WHEN A LEAKED U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY MEMO SOUNDING THE ALARM SAW THE LIGHT OF DAY. WHAT REMAINS STILL IN THE DARK IS THE EXACT ROLE MICHIGAN??S DETAIL-ORIENTED GOVERNOR PLAYED IN SUBJECTING THE PEOPLE OF FLINT TO THE HAZARDS OF A POLLUTED RIVER DOUBLING AS THEIR MUNICIPAL WATER SUPPLY. WE ALSO NEED TO BE CLEAR ON WHAT THE GOVERNOR??S OFFICE AND OTHER STATE OFFICIALS KNEW ABOUT THE DANGERS POSED BY THAT RIVER BEFORE THE DECISION TO USE IT WAS MADE. SNYDER CAN HELP SHED LIGHT ON THAT BY RELEASING ALL OF HIS EMAILS??BOTH FROM BOTH HIS GOVERNMENT ACCOUNT AND ANY PERSONAL EMAIL ACCOUNTS THAT HE MIGHT HAVE USED TO CONDUCT STATE BUSINESS??GOING BACK TO AT LEAST AS EARLY AS THE START OF 2012 WHEN MEMBERS OF HIS OWN ADMINISTRATION CONSIDERED AND REJECTED USING FLINT??S RIVER. GIVEN HIS WILLINGNESS TO RELEASE TWO YEARS?? WORTH OF EMAILS TURNING OVER DOCUMENTS FROM ANOTHER TWO YEARS SHOULD BE NO PROBLEM FOR A GOVERNOR COMMITTED TO TRANSPARENCY.

1327,10390059.0,2016-01-28T23:15:00+00:00,PENTAGON??S PROGRESSIVE REVOLUTION ADDS MORE MATERNITY LEAVE,THE PENTAGON ANNOUNCED THURSDAY A SERIES OF CHANGES TO ITS MATERNITY POLICY SAYING FEMALE TROOPS COULD RECEIVE AS MUCH AS 12 WEEKS OF PAID LEAVE NEW FATHERS COULD TAKE 14 PAID DAYS OFF AND THE MILITARY WOULD PAY FOR TROOPS TO FREEZE SPERM AND EGGS. IT WAS A SEEMINGLY TRANSFORMATIONAL ANNOUNCEMENT AND YET IT WAS NOT WELCOME NEWS ALL IN UNIFORM. SOME CALLED SETTING SUCH STANDARDS ACROSS THE SERVICE BRANCHES WAS MICROMANAGING BY THE PENTAGON. OTHERS SAID IT WOULD AFFECT FORCE READINESS. MOST OF ALL FOR FEMALE MEMBERS OF THE NAVY AND MARINE CORPS IT MEANT SIX WEEKS LESS OF LEAVE THAN THEY WERE PROMISED JUST SIX MONTHS AGO. AT THE HEART OF CRITICS?? WORRY IS A MILITARY SEEMINGLY OVERWHELMED BY THE NUMBER OF SOCIAL CHANGES PUT FORTH BY SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ASH CARTER IN LESS THAN A YEAR ALL TO ATTRACT MORE TROOPS TO A SHRINKING FORCE. LAST YEAR CARTER REPLACED THE MILITARY??S PENSION PLAN WHICH THE MILITARY PAID ONLY AFTER 20 YEARS OF SERVICE WITH A THRIFT SAVINGS PLAN SOMETHING LIKE A 401K ALLOWING TROOPS TO LEAVE AT ANY TIME. LAST MONTH CARTER ANNOUNCED THAT ALL COMBAT POSITIONS WOULD BE OPEN TO WOMEN OVER THE OBJECTIONS OF THE MARINE CORPS. LATER THIS YEAR CARTER IS EXPECTED TO ALLOW TRANSGENDER TROOPS TO OPENLY SERVE. ??IT??S A LOT FOR US TO TAKE? ONE SENIOR OFFICIAL EXPLAINED. WHILE MAKING THE ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT CHANGES IN MATERNITY LEAVE CARTER REPEATEDLY NOTED THAT SUCH LEAVE POLICY MAKES THE MILITARY COMPETITIVE AND ??EXTREMELY GENEROUS? COMPARED TO SOME OF THE BEST PRIVATE SECTOR POLICIES. THE FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT OF 1993 OFFERS EMPLOYEES UP TO 12 WEEKS OF UNPAID MATERNITY LEAVE MAKING THE MILITARY PROPOSAL THE MOST PROGRESSIVE GOVERNMENT PROPOSAL. IT IS ??IMPERATIVE FOR ATTRACTING AND RETAINING TALENT? CARTER SAID THURSDAY WHILE MAKING THE ANNOUNCEMENT. MANY CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY SUCH EFFORTS ARE NEEDED FOR A SHRINKING MILITARY WITH A TENUOUS BUDGET. THAT IS THEY DON??T OBJECT TO THE CHANGES THEMSELVES BUT TO THE PACE OF THEM ESPECIALLY FOR AN INSTITUTION ACCUSTOMED TO CUSTOM. THE ARMY ALONE IS SET TO SHRINK FROM 450000 TO 420000 TROOPS IN 2016. CRITICS PRIVATELY ASKED WHY DOES THE MILITARY NEED TO WORRY ABOUT RETENTION AT A TIME OF DOWNSIZING? ??OFTEN PEOPLE ASK: WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WE ARE TRYING TO SOLVE?? ONE DEFENSE OFFICIAL EXPLAINED. AND WHILE SUCH CHANGES COULD HELP RETENTION WHAT ATTRACTS PEOPLE TO JOIN THE MILITARY IS NOT BENEFITS BUT PUBLIC SERVICE CRITICS EXPLAINED TO THE DAILY BEAST. SUPPORTERS OF THE SECRETARY??S MOVES NOTE THAT HIS JOB IS TO THINK BEYOND TODAY??S WARS AND THAT THE MILITARY CAN ONLY RETAIN AMERICA??S BEST BY GIVING THEM THE BEST BENEFITS. MOREOVER THE MILITARY HAS HAD A HARD TIME KEEPING WOMEN IN THE SERVICES PARTICULARLY THOSE IN THEIR LATE 20S TO EARLY 30S PRIME TIME FOR HAVING CHILDREN. THE NEW POLICY AFFECTS ROUGHLY 200000 WOMEN WHO MAKE UP 14.8 PERCENT OF ENLISTED PERSONNEL AND 17.4 PERCENT OF THE OFFICER CORPS ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE. ON AVERAGE 4000 WOMEN IN ACTIVE DUTY GIVE BIRTH EACH YEAR ACCORDING TO THOSE STATISTICS. IN ALL THE CHANGES ARE EXPECTED TO COST $385 MILLION OVER A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD TO IMPLEMENT DEFENSE OFFICIALS SAID. THE MILITARY HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PART OF SOCIAL REFORMS SOMETIMES AHEAD OF THE REST OF THE NATION BUT RECENTLY IT HAS FALLEN BEHIND. IT TOOK YEARS??AND A SERIES OF STUDIES AND INTERNAL CAMPAIGNS??FOR THE MILITARY TO ACCEPT THE REPEAL OF ??DON??T ASK DON??T TELL? IN 2010 FOR EXAMPLE. BUT THE TIME ALLOWED THE MILITARY CULTURE TO ASSIMILATE TO CHANGE LEADING TO A RELATIVELY SMOOTH CHANGE IN POLICY. BEFORE THURSDAY??S ANNOUNCEMENT EACH OF THE SERVICES DECIDED HOW MUCH MATERNITY LEAVE TO PROVIDE. LAST JULY THE NAVY AND MARINES CORPS GAVE THEIR TROOPS 18 WEEKS OF MATERNITY LEAVE. THE U.S. ARMY AND AIR FORCE OFFERED SIX WEEKS OF MATERNITY LEAVE. CARTER SAID WOMEN IN THE NAVY AND MARINE CORPS CURRENTLY EXPECTING WOULD BE ALLOWED THE 18 WEEKS PAID LEAVE PROMISED TO THEM. BUT THE NAVY WAS NOT HAPPY. ??SECRETARY [OF THE NAVY RAY] MABUS IS IN THE SAME PLACE HE WAS WHEN HE ANNOUNCED 18 WEEKS OF MATERNITY LEAVE FOR SAILORS AND MARINES. HE FEELS THAT MEANINGFUL MATERNITY LEAVE WHEN IT MATTERS MOST IS ONE OF THE BEST WAYS THAT WE CAN SUPPORT THE WOMEN WHO SERVE OUR COUNTY AND ALSO SERVES AS A SAFEGUARD AGAINST LOSING SKILLED SERVICE MEMBERS? SAID NAVY SPOKESMAN CAPT. PATRICK MCNALLY IN ADDITION TO MORE LEAVE CARTER SAID HE WOULD EXPAND MILITARY DAY CARE HOURS SUCH THAT THEY ARE OPEN 14 HOURS A DAY INSTALL MOTHER??S ROOMS AT ANY FACILITY WHERE MORE THAN 50 WOMEN WORK ALLOW SERVICE MEMBERS TO EXTEND THEIR STAY AT A FACILITY FOR THEIR CHILDREN TO FINISH SCHOOL AND ALLOW BOTH LEAVE FOR BOTH MOTHERS AND FATHERS WHO ARE ADOPTING. THE SECRETARY WAS UNDETERRED BY GROWING CONCERN ABOUT THE CHANGES. ??I ASSURE YOU THERE ARE MORE INITIATIVES TO COME? CARTER SAID THURSDAY. ,4540.0

ROGAN HAD PREVIOUSLY CALLED HIM OUT FOR LIFTING OTHER COMICS?? MATERIAL IN A 2005 BLOG POST BUT AFTER THE 2007 VIDEO WENT VIRAL PEOPLE BEGAN POSTING CLIPS OF MENCIA??S BITS NEXT TO THOSE OF OTHER COMICS MUCH LIKE THE SCHUMER VIDEO. MENCIA??S JOKE THEFT WAS PARTICULARLY EGREGIOUS: HE COPIED AN INFAMOUS BIT FROM BILL COSBY ALMOST WORD-FOR-WORD MIMICKING COSBY??S DELIVERY AND USING THE EXACT SAME PUNCHLINE. DENIS LEARY??S CAREER WAS NEVER THE SAME AFTER HE WAS ACCUSED OF STEALING JOKES FROM BILL HICKS AND LOUIS C.K.

A LOT OF JOKES IN COMEDY ARE DERIVATIVE. THEY??RE MINED FROM UNIVERSAL EXPERIENCES LIKE SEX LOVE PARENTING FAMILY??WHICH IS WHY COMICS HAVE TO WORK PARTICULARLY HARD TO DISTINGUISH THEMSELVES. THE SCHUMER VIDEO RAISES QUESTIONS WHETHER WE CAN EVER BE SURE OF THE ORIGINALITY OF A JOKE.

IT CAME TO THE COOK COUNTY MEDICAL EXAMINER??S OFFICE DRESSED IN A GRAY T-SHIRT BLUE SWIM TRUNKS AND BLACK SOCKS AND WITH AN ENDOTRACHEAL TUBE AND VARIOUS CATHETERS. IT WAS A 6-YEAR-OLD BOY NAMED BRIAN PAZ. DR. STEVEN WHITE OF THE MEDICAL EXAMINER??S OFFICE REPORTED A FRACTURE IN THE BOY??S RIGHT HAND BRUISING ON HIS NECK A CONTUSION ON HIS LOWER BACK. THE OUTLINE OF HIS RIBS COULD BE SEEN HIS ABDOMEN WAS ??SOFT AND SUNKEN.? WHITE DETERMINED PAZ HAD DIED OF STARVATION. THIS WAS A HOMICIDE. EXCEPT TO THE CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT WHO HAS NEVER REFERRED TO PAZ AS A HOMICIDE VICTIM. SPOKESMAN ANTHONY GUGLIELMI TOLD THE DAILY BEAST THAT THEIR CASE ON PAZ IS A ??DEATH INVESTIGATION CENTERED AROUND SOME CHILD NEGLECT ISSUES.? DETECTIVES WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO THE BOY??S FATHER GUGLIELMI ADDED BUT THE MAN FLED THE COUNTRY FOLLOWING HIS SON??S DEATH. THE FATHER COULD BE AS FAR AWAY AS COLOMBIA WHERE HE RETURNED FROM WITH AN EMACIATED AND DYING SON IN LATE JUNE 2014. ??WE ARE WORKING WITH FEDERAL PARTNERS? TO FIND THE FATHER GUGLIELMI SAID. IT??S UNCLEAR WHAT THE FATHER WOULD HAVE TO SAY FOR CHICAGO POLICE TO OFFICIALLY CONSIDER PAZ??S DEATH A HOMICIDE. A CONFESSION CERTAINLY WOULDN??T HURT BUT WHERE DO YOU DRAW THE LINE BETWEEN INTENTIONAL NEGLECT AND BAD PARENTING? ONE THING IS CLEAR: THE MEDICAL EVIDENCE IS IRREFUTABLE. PAZ DID NOT DIE BY NATURAL CAUSES??FAR FROM IT THE YOUNG BOY STARVED TO DEATH. *** CHICAGO POLICE COUNT 407 HOMICIDES IN 2014 ON ITS WEBSITE FOUR SHORT OF THE 411 NOTED IN RESPONSE TO A FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT BY THE DAILY BEAST. SOME OBSERVERS COUNT AS MANY AS 460 HOMICIDES AND OTHERS AS FEW AS 427. THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THOSE NUMBERS AND CPD??S 411 ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO PIN DOWN BUT THE FOIA REQUEST ALSO SOUGHT THE NAMES AND OTHER IDENTIFYING INFORMATION OF THOSE VICTIMS MAKING THE TASK A BIT EASIER. THE MEDICAL EXAMINER??S OFFICE IS THE BEST PLACE TO BEGIN WHEN SEEKING THE PRECISE NUMBER OF THOSE KILLED IN CHICAGO IN A GIVEN YEAR. THE OFFICE PERFORMED 449 AUTOPSIES THAT WERE CLASSIFIED AS HOMICIDES IN 2014 A SEPARATE FOIA REQUEST REVEALED.?Ÿ THAT MEANS IN 2014 THERE WERE AT LEAST 30 DEATHS CLASSIFIED AS A HOMICIDES THAT DID NOT MAKE THE CPD??S OFFICIAL COUNT. MANY OF THOSE WHO WERE LISTED AS HOMICIDE VICTIMS BY THE MEDICAL EXAMINER BUT NOT BY POLICE WERE VICTIMS OF PAST GUN VIOLENCE. MORE THAN 2000 PEOPLE WERE SHOT IN CHICAGO LAST YEAR ?? A NUMBER IS SHOCKING BUT ALSO DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE RAVAGES OF THE CRACK ERA. EVERY YEAR MEN AND WOMEN WHO WERE SHOT AS LONG AS A DECADE AGO DIE AS A RESULT FROM THESE INJURIES. TRACKING THEM DOWN AND CHECKING THEIR NAMES OFF THE LIST OF HOMICIDES LISTED BY THE MEDICAL EXAMINER BUT NOT POLICE RESULTS IN A TOUR OF THE CITY??S NURSING HOMES. ONE BY ONE WEEK BY WEEK THAT??S WHAT TOOK UP THIS PAST SUMMER??S DAYS. BETWEEN THE GUNSHOT VICTIMS OF YEARS PAST AND THE ACCIDENTAL OR JUSTIFIABLE DEATHS THE NUMBER KEPT GETTING SMALLER.?Ÿ I WHITTLED THE NUMBER DOWN FROM MORE THAN TWO DOZEN TO TEN AND EVENTUALLY TO ONE: BRIAN PAZ. IF YOU COUNT THE CHILD AS A VICTIM OF HOMICIDE PAZ WOULD HAVE BEEN THE CITY??S 412TH IN 2014. REGARDLESS OF HOW ONE MIGHT CLASSIFY THE BOY??S DEATH MOST OF WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT HIM COMES FROM A THREE-PAGE POLICE REPORT AND WHITE??S SIX-PAGE AUTOPSY REPORT. NO BIRTH ANNOUNCEMENT. NO OBITUARY. NO REMEMBRANCE OF HIM ON THE BLOCK WHERE HE DIED. *** THE NAMES OF PAZ??S MOTHER AND FATHER ARE BLACKED OUT ON THE INCIDENT REPORT PROVIDED BY THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. ALL WE KNOW IS THAT BOTH HAVE DISAPPEARED SINCE THE JULY 2014 MORNING WHEN THE 6-YEAR-OLD WAS BROUGHT TO THE HOSPITAL WHERE HE EVENTUALLY DIED. THAT PREVIOUS NIGHT THE MOTHER TOLD POLICE PAZ??S FATHER BROUGHT THE BOY HOME SAYING HE ??COULD NOT TAKE CARE OF THEIR SON ANYMORE? AN OFFICER WROTE. AFTER LIVING WITH THE CHILD FOR SOME TIME IN COLOMBIA THE FATHER RETURNED HIS SON TO MOM WHO BECAME UPSET THAT PAZ LOOKED MALNOURISHED. SHE FED PAZ A HOT DOG AND FRIES ACCORDING TO THE REPORT. IT WAS THE CHILD??S SIMPLE AND VERY AMERICAN LAST MEAL. JUST AFTER MIDNIGHT THE MOTHER CHECKED ON PAZ AND FOUND HIM ??FOAMING AT THE MOUTH AND UNRESPONSIVE? THE REPORT STATES. MUCH OF THE INFORMATION ABOUT PAZ??S MOTHER IS UP TO SPECULATION BUT ANYONE WHO HAS READ MORE THAN A FEW POLICE REPORTS CAN EASILY FILL IN THE BLANKS. ??MOTHER RELATED THAT SHE IS A [REDACTED] PATIENT AND WAS ADMITTED TO MERCY HOSPITAL A FEW WEEKS AGO. SHE ALSO STATED THAT SHE IS A [REDACTED] PATIENT HAS BEEN TO ST. MARY ELIZABETH CLINIC AND NAZARETH [REDACTED]. SHE RELATED THAT SHE TAKES [REDACTED] PRESCRIPTIONS AND [REDACTED].

DIFFERENT STARS FAVOR DIFFERENT METHODS FOR CHOOSING WHICH LUCKY LAD OR LADY WILL HAVE THE HONOR OF POSING ON THEIR LESS ATTRACTIVE SIDES. SOME CELEBRITIES PREFER TO DATE EQUALLY WELL-KNOWN KNOWN STARS WHILE OTHERS LIKE TO SLUM IT WITH NON-FAMOUS (BUT EXTREMELY BEAUTIFUL) FACES OR MISCELLANEOUS KENNEDYS. FAMOUS SCIENTOLOGISTS SELECT PARTNERS BASED ON THEIR THETAN LEVELS. TAYLOR SWIFT CONSULTS HER RHYMING DICTIONARY (AND HER GROWING ROSTER OF BFF??S EXES.

BUT THE PENTAGON COULD NOT SAY WHY THOSE TROOPS WERE THERE OR WHAT THEIR MISSION WAS. IT??S ALL PART OF AN INCREASINGLY DANGEROUS AFGHAN WAR THAT??S BEING FOUGHT MORE AND MORE IN THE SHADOWS. TWO HH60 PAVE HAWK HELICOPTERS SOUGHT TO RESCUE THE INJURED TROOPS. ACCORDING TO PENTAGON SPOKESMAN PETER COOK ONE WAS TURNED AWAY WHILE THE OTHER LANDED. INITIAL REPORTS FROM THE PENTAGON SAID IT DID NOT LEAVE THE SITE BECAUSE IT WAS UNDER MORTAR FIRE COOK THEN SAID HELICOPTER HIT A WALL DAMAGING ITS ROTARY. EITHER WAY THE HELICOPTER COULD NOT TAKE OFF AND THE U.S. TROOPS WERE ENGAGED IN AN HOURS-LONG FIREFIGHT WHOSE RESOLUTION IS STILL UNCLEAR. AT PRESS TIME THE BATTLE WHICH BEGAN 12 HOURS EARLIER HAD NOT ENDED DEFENSE OFFICIALS ACKNOWLEDGED. FOX NEWS REPORTED LATE TUESDAY THAT MORE THAN A DOZEN TROOPS WERE SURROUNDED BY A ??SEA? OF TALIBAN AND AWAITING AN AC-130 GUNSHIP TO PROVIDE AIR COVER. AT A PENTAGON BRIEFING TUESDAY COOK SAID HE COULD NOT SAY WHY THOSE U.S. TROOPS WERE FIGHTING IN MARJA WHETHER THEIR MISSION WAS A COUNTERTERRORISM OR COMBAT ONE WHY ONE HELICOPTER WAS WAVED OFF BUT ANOTHER WAS ALLOWED TO LAND HOW MANY AFGHAN SOLDIERS WERE INJURED ALONG WITH THEIR AMERICAN COUNTERPARTS OR EVEN IF THE INJURED HAD BEEN EVACUATED FROM THE ACTIVE BATTLEFIELD. IN PART THE SECRECY STEMS FROM THE KIND OF AMERICAN FORCES NOW BATTLING IN MARJA. IN HELMAND PROVINCE AS IN OTHER PARTS OF AFGHANISTAN SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES HAVE STEPPED IN WHERE THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS WITHDRAWN MORE TRADITIONAL TROOPS. THESE FORCES ARE TRADITIONALLY SHROUDED IN SECRECY. THEIR MISSIONS ARE GIVEN ADDITIONAL LAYERS OF ??OPERATIONAL SECURITY? A CATCHALL TERM THAT ALLOWS THE PENTAGON TO SHARE LITTLE ABOUT WHAT ARE OFTEN DEADLY DUTIES. AND BECAUSE OF THAT AN UNSEEN FORCE IS NOW LEADING BATTLES ONCE FOUGHT BY TRADITIONAL FORCES JUST AS THE TALIBAN APPEARS TO BE RESURGING. SUCH DEPENDENCY ON SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO INDEPENDENTLY ASSESS THE U.S. WAR EFFORT AND THE COSTS OF IT. IN SOME WAYS THE AFGHAN WAR HAS COME FULL CIRCLE IT WAS SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES WHO ORIGINALLY FOUGHT TO DISLODGE THE TALIBAN THERE AFTER 9/11. BUT TODAY??S INCREASED DEPENDENCY ON SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES HAS SOME DEFENSE OFFICIALS ASKING HOW THIN THE U.S. MILITARY CAN STRETCH SUCH AN EXCLUSIVE FORCE THROUGH ITS SEEMINGLY ENDLESS BATTLES WITH JIHADISTS AND INSURGENTS. THESE SPECIALIZED TROOPS ARE A MAJOR PART OF THE U.S. EFFORT IN IRAQ AND SYRIA AS WELL. A SENIOR ADMINISTRATION SOURCE TELLS THE DAILY BEAST THAT THERE ARE REVIEWS ONGOING ABOUT THE USE OF SUCH FORCES THERE ARE SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH OF THEM TO GO AROUND TO ALL THE WORLD??S HOTSPOTS. THAT??S COUPLED WITH A SECOND CONCERN: SOME AT THE PENTAGON PRIVATELY FRET THAT AFGHANISTAN NOT IRAQ OR SYRIA WILL BE THE CONFLICT THAT CONSUMES THEIR ATTENTION IN 2016. THE FALLEN SERVICE MEMBER IN MARJA MARKS THE FIRST U.S. COMBAT DEATH IN AFGHANISTAN THIS YEAR AND THE SEVENTH IN TWO WEEKS. ON DEC. 21 SIX AIRMEN WERE KILLED JUST OUTSIDE BAGRAM AIR BASE 30 MILES NORTH OF KABUL. OFTEN THE PENTAGON DOES NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SPECIAL OPERATORS ARE BACK ON THE FRONTLINES UNLESS IT HAS TO??BECAUSE SOMEONE WAS INJURED OR KILLED. CASUALTIES HAVE BECOME THE GRIM WINDOW INTO WHERE THE U.S. EFFORT AGAINST THE TALIBAN HAS MOVED AND THE LEVEL OF FIGHTING INVOLVED. MARJA??ONCE THE SITE OF A MASSIVE OFFENSIVE BY THE U.S. MARINES AND VICTORY CELEBRATIONS BY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION??IS JUST THE LATEST EXAMPLE. IN OCTOBER SPECIAL FORCES ALONGSIDE THEIR AFGHAN COUNTERPARTS SOUGHT TO TAKE BACK THE NORTHERN CITY OF KUNDUZ WHICH HAD FALLEN INTO TALIBAN HANDS JUST DAYS EARLIER. THE FORCES ORDERED STRIKES ON A BUILDING THAT TURNED OUT TO BE A HOSPITAL RUN BY DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS KILLING 22. NO ONE IN THE U.S. MILITARY MENTIONED THAT THESE ELITE TROOPS HAD MOVED NORTH TO FIGHT THE TALIBAN IN KUNDUZ UNTIL AFTER THE HOSPITAL WAS HIT. AND THE LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE AREA WHICH ONCE WAS SECURED LARGELY BY GERMAN FORCES AND WAS RELATIVELY QUIET APPEARED TO BE A FACTOR IN THE MISTAKEN ATTACK. AS U.S. FORCES HAVE DRAWN DOWN THEIR PRESENCE IN AFGHANISTAN OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS THE TALIBAN HAS MADE GAINS IN AREAS LEFT TO AFGHAN CONTROL. IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS ALONE IN ADDITION TO KUNDUZ AND MARJA THE TALIBAN HAS MOVED TOWARD KABUL. BUT THE U.S. PLAN TO WITHDRAW MOST OF ITS 9800 TROOPS BY THE END OF THIS YEAR REMAINS INTACT. TUESDAY??S ATTACK DID NOT CHANGE THAT PLAN. INDEED THE PENTAGON REFUSED EVEN TO ACKNOWLEDGE A CHANGE IN AFGHANISTAN??S LANDSCAPE DESPITE UNDISPUTED TALIBAN GAINS. ??I WOULD NOT CONCEDE [THE AFGHAN SECURITY FORCES] ARE LOSING GROUND ACROSS THE COUNTRY? COOK SAID. ??WITH ADDITIONAL REPORTING BY KIMBERLY DOZIER ,4279.0

AWARDS SEASON MAY FIRST COME TO MIND WITH IMAGES OF GLAMOROUSLY DECADENT GOWNS SWISHING DOWN THE RED CARPET ALONG WITH PERFECTLY-TAILORED TUXEDOS. BUT FOR ANOTHER COTERIE IN THIS WORLD OF THE BEAUTIFUL AND FAMOUS IT IS THE SEASON OF VACATIONING IN WARM LOCALES AND MOST IMPORTANTLY SHOWING OFF ONE??S IMPRESSIVE BODY TO YOUR MANY ADORING FANS THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA. AND FOR FEMALE CELEBS NO PHYSICAL ASSET IS DRAWING MORE ATTENTION THAN THE ASS. CASE IN POINT: EMILY RATAJKOWSKI OF BLURRED LINES MUSIC VIDEO FAME SUCCESSFULLY CAUGHT THE EYE OF THE MAJOR CELEBRITY TABLOIDS WITH AN INSTAGRAM SHOT OF HER ??PERT POSTERIOR? AS THE MAIL ONLINE PUT IT BARELY COVERED BY A PAIR OF BLACK-AND-WHITE CHECKED BIKINI BOTTOMS.

MAGAZINE. BUT RATAJKOWSKI??S ABILITY TO SEND SOCIAL MEDIA INTO A TIZZY WITH A NEARLY-BARE SHOT OF HER REAR HAS A LONG PRECEDENCE THAT IS A TESTAMENT TO THE ASS??S MAGNETIC AND SOMETIMES DARK POWER THROUGHOUT HISTORY. AND YES THAT IS A HISTORY THAT GOES BACK WELL BEFORE KIM KARDASHIAN ??BROKE THE INTERNET? WITH HER SHINY DERRIERE ON THE COVER OF PAPER MAGAZINE??WHICH IN CONJUNCTION WITH NICKI MINAJ??S BOOTY-CENTRIC ??ANACONDA? LED MY COLLEAGUE KEVIN FALLON TO DECLARE 2014 THE ??YEAR OF THE BUTT?.

AND SIR MIX-A-LOT DOES NOT STAND ALONE IN HIS BUTTOCKS FIXATION THOUGH IT DOES NOT AND HAS NOT ALWAYS STEMMED FROM THE FACT THAT ??WHEN A GIRL WALKS IN WITH AN ITTY BITTY WAIST AND A ROUND THING IN YOUR FACE YOU GET SPRUNG.? CENTURIES EVEN MILLENNIA OF DEPICTING GLORIFYING AND VALORIZING THE BUTT THROUGH ART AND CULTURE HAVE BEEN FUELED BY MUCH MORE THAN SEXUALIZATION. SOMETHING ABOUT THE BUTT HAS DEEPLY FASCINATED WESTERN SOCIETY FOR BETTER AND SOMETIMES FOR WORSE. THE REAR HAS A CERTAIN QUALITY TO BE BOTH EROTIC YET PLAYFUL ONE OF THE SEXIEST PARTS OF THE BODY YET ALSO ONE MOST OFTEN UTILIZED AS COMEDY FODDER. EVEN THE WORDS ??BUTT? ??BUM? AND ??ASS? ELICIT LAUGHS IN A WAY ??BOOBS? ??TITS? OR THE MANY SLANG TERMS FOR MALE AND FEMALE GENITALIA DO NOT. AT THE SAME TIME IF ONE TRACES THE DEPICTION OF THE FEMALE ASS THROUGHOUT HISTORY IT??S CLEAR THAT SEXUAL MORES AND RACIAL STEREOTYPES HAVE ALSO LONG SURROUNDED THE OBSESSION WITH THE BUTT. RACHEL KOUSSER A PROFESSOR OF ART HISTORY AT CITY UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK (CUNY)??S GRADUATE CENTER EXPLAINED TO THE DAILY BEAST THAT WHILE THE GREEKS AND ROMANS WERE COMFORTABLE WITH DEPICTIONS OF NUDITY IT WAS THE MALE NUDE WHO WAS MORE OFTEN ??EROTICIZED? WHILE FEMALES WERE NUDE ??USUALLY IN NARRATIVE SCENES WHEN THEY WERE ABOUT TO GET RAPED OR INJURED.? THAT CHANGED WITH THE REVERED PRAXITELES?? SCULPTURE APHRODITE OF CNIDUS WHICH KOUSSER CALLED THE ??FIRST VALORIZED FEMALE NUDE.? VIEWERS COULD TAKE IN APHRODITE FROM ALL ANGLES INCLUDING HER ASS. KAREN LEADER AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF ART HISTORY AT FLORIDA ATLANTIC UNIVERSITY TOLD THE DAILY BEAST THAT SHE SUSPECTS THE BUTT MAY HAVE BEEN LESS TABOO IN ANTIQUITY BECAUSE SIMPLY PUT BOTH LADIES AND GENTS HAVE THEM. ??IF I THINK OF REPRESENTATIONS OF WOMEN FROM BEHIND THEY ARE USUALLY LESS SEXUAL BECAUSE A WOMAN??S BODY AND A MAN??S ARE NOT THAT DIFFERENT FROM BEHIND??WHEREAS A FEMALE NUDE FROM THE FRONT IS OBVIOUSLY FEMALE. THE FEMALE NUDE FROM BEHIND BY ITS NATURE IS LESS SEXUAL IN TRADITIONAL HISTORY. IT DOESN??T INVITE THE SAME KIND OF SEXUAL RESPONSE.? OF COURSE THAT??S PRESUMING THE VIEWER IS A (HETEROSEXUAL) MAN WITH HIS ??MALE GAZE.? ??IF YOU IMAGINE THAT FOR MOST OF THE HISTORY OF ART THE PRESUMED VIEWER IS A MAN THEN A MAN LOOKING AT A FEMALE BODY SEES BREASTS AND A FEMALE CROTCH AS SEXUAL AREAS [BECAUSE] MEN DON??T HAVE THEM? EXPLAINED LEADER. ??SO IT??S SOMETHING THEY WANT AND ENJOY SEEING IN ART. A WOMAN FROM BEHIND IS NOT OVERTLY SEXUAL.? THAT??S THE REASON LEADER THINKS THAT BUTTS HAVE TAKEN ON A CERTAIN ACCEPTABLE SEXUALITY??DARE WE SAY A CHEEKINESS. ??FROM BEHIND THERE??S SOMETHING JUST A LITTLE MORE CHASTE AND I THINK IT??S NOT THAT DIFFERENT FROM A MAN??S BODY? SHE SAID. ??VERY OFTEN THE FEMALE NUDE IN THE HISTORY OF WESTERN ART HAS HAD SOME LITTLE ATTEMPT TO COVER UP A BIT? SAID ANNE EATON A PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY AND ART HISTORY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO.

THERE??S AN ATTEMPT TO COVER YET REVEAL.? THIS IDEALIZATION OF A WOMAN BEING BOTH EROTIC YET CHASTE IN COVERING THE FRONT BUT FLAUNTING (OR MOSTLY FLAUNTING) HER REAR SPEAKS TO A LARGER DOUBLE STANDARD THAT STILL APPLIES TODAY SAID EATON. ??THERE??S A REALLY DEEP TENSION THAT RUNS ALL THE WAY THROUGH WESTERN ART AND POP CULTURE BETWEEN THESE TWO DEMANDS FOR WOMEN: IT??S THE ??LADY IN THE STREET BUT A FREAK IN THE BEDROOM?? PHENOMENON? NOTED EATON. ??SHE CAN??T BE A CHASTE PRUDE BUT SHE??S GOT TO HAVE SOME MODICUM OF MODESTY.? EATON POINTED OUT THAT MANY OF OUR POPULAR BRANDS TODAY PLAY ON WHAT SHE CALLED A ??DEEP SEXUAL DOUBLE STANDARD.? ??THAT??S VICTORIA??S SECRET? SHE SAID. ??THEY??RE HARDLY WEARING ANYTHING. THEY??RE NOT NAKED BECAUSE A LITTLE COVERING IS SEXY??AND THAT IS BECAUSE MODESTY IS A VIRTUE FOR WOMEN.? JUST AS A FLIRTY FLASH OF BUTT CAN BE CONSIDERED A SUFFICIENTLY MODEST EXPRESSION OF FEMALE SEXUALITY SHOWING TOO MUCH OR HAVING TOO LARGE AN ASS HAS AN UGLY HISTORY OF STEREOTYPES ABOUT DANGEROUSLY EXCESSIVELY SEXUAL WOMEN??ESPECIALLY WOMEN OF COLOR. ??THE IDEA THAT WOMEN OF COLOR HAVE BIGGER BEHINDS AND ARE ALSO MORE HIGHLY SEXUAL IS AN AGE-OLD STEREOTYPE AND A REALLY VILE ONE? SAID LEADER. ONE OF THE MOST OBSESSED-OVER FEMALE BEHINDS WAS THAT OF SAARTJIE BAARTMAN ALSO KNOWN AT ??THE HOTTENTOT VENUS.?? BAARTMAN WAS GAWKED AT BY WHITE EUROPEANS IN THE EARLY 19TH CENTURY AFTER SHE WAS TAKEN FROM HER NATIVE SOUTH AFRICA BY HER SLAVE MASTER HENDRIK CESARS AND BRITISH MILITARY DOCTOR ALEXANDER DUNLOP. SHE WAS BROUGHT TO LONDON TO BE IN ESSENTIALLY A FREAK SHOW. SHE??ESPECIALLY HER BUTTOCKS??BECAME AN ??OBJECT OF PRURIENT GAZE SCIENTIFIC FASCINATION AND DISTURBED BEWILDERMENT? TO LEERING LONDONERS AS CAROLINE ELKINS WROTE IN THE NEW YORK TIMES. ??THERE WAS AN ASSOCIATION FORMED BETWEEN BLACKNESS BEING AFRICAN AND HAVING BY EUROPEAN STANDARDS AN UNUSUALLY LARGE REAR. BUT THIS IS NOT EROTICIZED. IT??S ALMOST THE OPPOSITE IT??S THE BEASTIAL OTHER? JESSE PRINZ A PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY AT CITY UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK??S GRADUATE CENTER TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. THE STEREOTYPES ASSOCIATED WITH WOMEN OF COLOR AND THEIR BUTTS FUELED CENTURIES OF RACISM SERVING AS ??EVIDENCE? THAT THESE WOMEN WERE MORE SEXUAL AND LESS MODEST AND THEREFORE LESS DESERVING OF RESPECT. SO EVEN WHILE EMILY RATAJKOWSKI MAY BE ABLE TO WRAP THE WORLD OF INSTAGRAM AROUND HER FINGER WITH A SHOT OF HER BARELY-CLAD BUTT THERE??S A SERIOUS UNDERSIDE TO THE POWER OF THE BACKSIDE WHICH IS FAR FROM A LAUGHING MATTER. ,33438.0

THE EASTERN WASHINGTON HIGH SCHOOL KIDS PART OF A TEEN COUNCIL CHAPTER OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD WERE MEETING WITH STATE REP.

98,9591884.0,2016-01-04T05:02:00+00:00,CHINA ASSEMBLES ITS STEALTH JET FLEET,CHINA HAS APPARENTLY BEGUN MASS PRODUCTION OF ITS NEW J-20 STEALTH FIGHTER MAKING IT ONLY THE SECOND COUNTRY IN THE WORLD TO PRODUCE RADAR-EVADING WARPLANES ON A LARGE SCALE. BUT AS WITH ALL MILITARY DEVELOPMENTS IN CHINA IT??S HARD TO SEPARATE FACT FROM COMMUNIST PARTY-SPONSORED FICTION??AND EQUALLY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT JUST HOW HEAVILY EVEN LARGE NUMBERS OF WORKING J-20S COULD WEIGH ON THE MILITARY BALANCE OF POWER IN THE PACIFIC REGION. THE CHINESE AIR FORCE DEBUTED THE FIRST PROTOTYPE OF THE BULKY TWIN-ENGINE TWIN-TAIL J-20 IN DECEMBER 2010 AT AN AIRFIELD IN SOUTHEAST CHINA BELONGING TO THE CHENGDU AEROSPACE CORPORATION A STATE-OWNED AIRPLANE-MAKER. BEIJING??S TEST PILOTS GOT TO WORK PUTTING THE NEW SUPERSONIC WARPLANE??AT 67 FEET LONG ONE OF THE BIGGEST FIGHTERS IN THE WORLD??THROUGH ITS PACES TESTING OUT ITS SYSTEMS FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS AND ENGINES. (THEY??RE EITHER RUSSIAN-MADE AL-31S OR CHINESE WS-10S.) OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS ANOTHER SEVEN COPIES OF THE J-20 JOINED THE FIRST EXAMPLE EACH SPORTING SMALL IMPROVEMENTS OVER ITS PREDECESSOR. ALL J-20S FEATURE THE DISTINCTIVE SHARP ANGLES OF A PLANE DESIGNED TO MINIMIZE ITS DETECTIBILITY BY ENEMY SENSORS. THE FIRST EIGHT J-20S WERE DEVELOPMENTAL MEANT TO SUPPORT THE GRADUAL REFINEMENT OF THE NEW PLANE??S FINAL DESIGN. BUT THE NINTH J-20 WHICH GOVERNMENT-RUN NEWS OUTLET XINHUA REVEALED IN A DEC. 29 STORY IS DIFFERENT. SIGNS POINT TO THIS J-20 BEING THE DEFINITIVE VERSION OF THE STEALTH FIGHTER??AND THE FIRST IN WHAT COULD BE A LONG PRODUCTION RUN POTENTIALLY NUMBERING IN THE SCORES OR EVEN HUNDREDS OF PLANES. TO BE CLEAR XINHUA WAS CAREFUL TO IMPLY BUT NOT SAY OUTRIGHT THAT THE J-20 HAS ENTERED FULL PRODUCTION. ??THE OUTSIDE WORLD WOULD INTERPRET IT AS THE FIRST MASS-PRODUCED AIRCRAFT OF THE TYPE J -20? THE NEWS SITE STATED. AND FOR GOOD REASON. FOR STARTERS THE NINTH J-20 SPORTS ALL THE SMALL IMPROVEMENTS OF PREVIOUS COPIES AS WELL AS A DIFFERENT NUMBERING SCHEME THAN COPIES ONE THROUGH EIGHT. THE APPARENT PROTOTYPES BEAR FOUR-DIGIT NUMBERS ON THEIR NOSES BEGINNING WITH ??20.? J-20 NUMBER-NINE??S NOSE CODE BEGINS WITH ??21???SPECIFICALLY ??2101.? J-20 2101 ALSO MADE ITS PHOTOGRAPHIC DEBUT IN YELLOW PRIMER PAINT A KIND OF UNDERCOAT INSTEAD OF THE BLACK OR SILVERISH PAINT THAT THE EIGHT PROTOTYPES WEAR. WHEREAS CHENGDU APPARENTLY PICKED THE COLOR SCHEME FOR THE DEVELOPMENTAL PLANES PAINTING OF THE FIRST PRODUCTION MODEL??WHICH COULD EVENTUALLY JOIN A FRONTLINE AIR FORCE UNIT????WOULD NEED TO BE DETERMINED BY THE MILITARY? XINHUA EXPLAINED. IF INDEED THE NINTH J-20 IS THE FIRST PRODUCTION MODEL THE NEXT STEP FOR THE CHINESE STEALTH FIGHTER IS PRETTY CLEAR. PLANE NUMBER 2101 WILL JOIN ONE OF THE CHINESE AIR FORCE??S REGULAR FIGHTER SQUADRONS SO THAT PILOTS AND MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL CAN BEGIN TRAINING ON THE TYPE. MORE J-20S WILL ROLL OUT OF THE FACTORY AT CHENGDU AND JOIN 2101 UNTIL THERE ARE ENOUGH PRODUCTION-MODEL J-20S FOR A FULL SQUADRON OF A DOZEN PLANES. WHEN THE SQUADRON HAS ENOUGH PLANES AND TRAINED PILOTS AND MAINTAINERS THE AIR FORCE CAN DECLARE THE FIRST J-20 UNIT ??COMBAT-READY???A MILESTONE MOST ANALYSTS EXPECT SOMETIME IN 2017. AT THAT TIME CHINA WILL JOIN AN EXCLUSIVE CLUB??AS ONLY THE SECOND COUNTRY TO FIELD A FLEET OF FRONTLINE RADAR-EVADING JETS. THE AMERICAN F-117 THE WORLD??S FIRST STEALTH WARPLANE ENTERED SERVICE WITH THE U.S. AIR FORCE IN 1983. THE U.S. B-2 STEALTH BOMBER FOLLOWED IN 1997 THE SUPERSONIC F-22 STEALTH FIGHTER IN 2005 AND THE F-22??S SMALLER COUSIN THE F-35 IN JULY 2015. BY THE 2030S THE PENTAGON COULD POSSESS AS MANY AS 1700 F-35S PLUS 180 OR SO F-22S AND 20 B-2S. NO OTHER COUNTRY HAS WAR-READY STEALTH WARPLANES ALTHOUGH RUSSIA IS WORKING ON ONE??AND EIGHT U.S. ALLIES HAVE ORDERED THE F-35 WITH SEVERAL MORE PLANNING ON ALSO BUYING THE PLANE IN THE NEAR FUTURE. BUT WHILE IT??S PRETTY CERTAIN CHINA WILL SOON DEPLOY J-20S IT??S NOT CLEAR WHY ?? OR HOW EFFECTIVELY??IT WILL DO SO. BEIJING HAS NEVER EXPLAINED EXACTLY WHAT THE J-20 IS FOR. IS IT A GROUND-ATTACK PLANE LIKE THE F-117? A HIGH- AND FAST-FLYING DOGFIGHTER LIKE THE F-22 OR A MULTI-ROLE ATTACK PLANE AND DOGFIGHTER LIKE THE F-35? AND HOW DOES THE J-20 FIT INTO THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT??S STRATEGY FOR STEADILY EXANDING ITS SPHERE OF INFLUENCE INTO THE EAST AND SOUTH CHINA SEAS AND THE INDIAN OCEAN? EYING THE J-20??S LARGE SIZE AND SLEEK LINES SOME ANALYSTS HAVE CLAIMED THAT THE J-20 IS A KIND OF AERIAL ASSASSIN. PERHAPS IT??S MEANT TO FLY FAST OVER LONG DISTANCES THROUGH U.S. AND ALLIED AIR DEFENSES TO FIRE MISSILES AT AIRBORNE TANKERS RADAR EARLY WARNING AIRCRAFT AND SPY PLANES. MAYBE IT WILL LOB BOMBS AND ROCKETS AT AIR BASES AND AIRCRAFT CARRIERS. AND CARLO KOPP AN ANALYST WITH THE AIR POWER AUSTRALIA THINK TANK WROTE THAT HE ANTICIPATES THE J-20 ??GROWING INTO THE AIR COMBAT ROLE AS MORE POWERFUL ENGINES BECOME AVAILABLE.? IN OTHER WORDS BECOMING A CLOSE-IN AIR-TO-AIR DOGFIGHTER ON PAR WITH THE F-22. KOPP??S QUALIFIER IS IMPORTANT. THE PRODUCTION-MODEL J-20 WILL APPARENTLY ENTER SERVICE WITH THE SAME ENGINES THAT POWER THE PROTOTYPES. BUT THE AL-31 OR WS-10??IT??S NOT CLEAR WHICH POWERPLANT THE J-20 USES??IS CLEARLY BEIJING??S SECOND CHOICE FOR THE NEW PLANE. CHINESE ENGINEERS ARE WORKING ON THE MORE POWERFUL WS-15 WHICH COULD GIVE THE J-20 MORE SPEED AND MANEUVERABILITY?? IF AND WHEN THE NEW MOTOR IS EVER READY. EVEN IF THE NINTH J-20 ISN??T THE FIRST PRODUCTION COPY IT AT LEAST REPRESENTS ANOTHER BIG STEP TOWARD THE PRODUCTION STANDARD??AND ANOTHER IMPRESSIVE FEAT FOR THE RAPIDLY-IMPROVING CHINESE AIR FORCE. BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT MILESTONE FOR CHINA??S EVOLVING STEALTH AIR FORCE STILL LIES SOMEWHERE IN THE FUTURE??ITS FIRST TIME IN COMBAT. THE U.S. AIR FORCE HAS DEPLOYED RADAR-EVADING WARPLANES IN ALL ITS MAJOR CONFLICTS SINCE THE UNITED STATES?? 1989 INVASION OF PANAMA. BY CONTRAST CHINA HASN??T FOUGHT A FULL-SCALE WAR SINCE ITS ABORTIVE ATTACK ON VIETNAM IN 1979. WARPLANE DEVELOPMENT IN A VACUUM IS ONE THING. BUT AS BEIJING??S OWN NEWS SERVICE NOTED ??WAR IS ANOTHER MATTER.? ,35221.0

DOCUMENTARY DISPELS MYTHS ABOUT SELF-LOVE,??WHY IS SOMETHING ALMOST EVERYBODY DOES SO HARD TO TALK ABOUT?? THAT??S THE GUIDING QUESTION THAT DIRECTOR NICHOLAS TANA EXPLORES IN STICKY: A (SELF) LOVE STORY A NEW DOCUMENTARY ON MASTURBATION COMING FEBRUARY 1ST PUN INTENDED. FOR NEARLY A DECADE TANA INTERVIEWED EVERYONE WHO WOULD TALK TO HIM ON CAMERA ABOUT MASTURBATION EVENTUALLY ASSEMBLING A MOTLEY CREW OF EXPERTS AND COMMENTATORS INCLUDING FORMER U.S. SURGEON GENERAL DR. JOYCELYN ELDERS COMEDIAN JANEANE GAROFALO PORN STAR NINA HARTLEY AND HUSTLER PUBLISHER LARRY FLYNT. IT??S A WEIRD MULTI-FACETED SOMETIMES MESSY INVESTIGATION OF ONE OF THE MOST UNIVERSAL BUT UNSPOKEN ASPECTS OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE: GETTING YOURSELF OFF. EVEN BASED ON UNRELIABLE SELF-REPORTING IT??S CLEAR THAT MOST PEOPLE MASTURBATE OR HAVE MASTURBATED IN THE PAST. ACCORDING TO A 2010 STUDY IN THE JOURNAL OF SEXUAL MEDICINE 68 PERCENT OF MEN AND 51 PERCENT OF WOMEN BETWEEN THE AGES OF 25 AND 29 SAID THEY HAD MASTURBATED IN THE LAST MONTH. GIVEN THE TABOOS AROUND SELF-PLEASURE IT??S QUITE POSSIBLE THAT EVEN THESE ARE LOW-BALL FIGURES. BUT IN THE SEXUALLY HYPOCRITICAL UNITED STATES IF YOU TRY TO TALK ABOUT MASTURBATING OR WORSE GET CAUGHT DOING IT THE CONSEQUENCES CAN BE A LOT WORSE THAN HAIRY PALMS. STICKY EXPLORES THIS POINT THROUGH TWO CASE STUDIES: THE 1991 ARREST OF PEE-WEE HERMAN STAR PAUL REUBENS FOR ALLEGEDLY MASTURBATING IN AN ADULT FILM THEATER IN SARASOTA FLORIDA AND BILL CLINTON??S 1994 FIRING OF JOYCELYN ELDERS THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN SURGEON GENERAL WHO SUGGESTED IN FRONT OF A UNITED NATIONS AIDS CONFERENCE THAT MASTURBATION COULD BE INCLUDED IN SEX EDUCATION PROGRAMS. ??IN REGARD TO MASTURBATION I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS A PART OF HUMAN SEXUALITY AND IT IS A PART OF SOMETHING THAT PERHAPS SHOULD BE TAUGHT? ELDERS SAID IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE PRACTICE COULD REDUCE THE RATE OF STIS. THE WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF SAID THAT THIS WAS ??ONE TOO MANY? AREAS OF DISAGREEMENT SHE HAD WITH THE PRESIDENT. OVER TWO DECADES LATER ELDERS SHAKES HER HEAD AT THE PERSISTENTLY HIGH RATES OF UNINTENDED PREGNANCY IN THE UNITED STATES AND WISHES MORE HAD CHANGED SINCE HER ABRUPT DISMISSAL. ??WE IN AMERICA CAN??T TALK ABOUT SEX? SHE TELLS TANA IN STICKY. ??WE CAN DO IT. BUT WE CAN??T TALK ABOUT IT.? WHEN PEOPLE DO TALK ABOUT MASTURBATION??AS THEY DO FOR ALL OF STICKY??S HOUR-LONG RUNTIME??IT BECOMES CLEAR HOW THOROUGHLY IT HAS BECOME INTERTWINED WITH AMERICAN COMMERCE AND CULTURE.

AS STICKY POINTS OUT FILM DEPICTIONS OF MASTURBATION FROM THE EXORCIST TO AMERICAN BEAUTY HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN NEGATIVE. MEDIA REPRESENTATION ASIDE IT IS WIDELY KNOWN BUT RARELY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE IS BIG MONEY IN MASTURBATION. ONLINE PORNOGRAPHY AND SEX TOYS ARE BOTH BILLION-DOLLAR INDUSTRIES AS LARRY FLYNT WELL KNOWS. THE SOLITARY BEHAVIOR DRIVING THE GROWTH OF THAT ECONOMY IS NOT EXACTLY A SECRET. ??SOME GUY WALKED UP TO ME BUT WHEN I AUTOGRAPHED HIS BOOK HE STUCK OUT HIS HAND TO ME AND SAID ??MR. FLYNT I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME MAKE IT THROUGH PUBERTY??? THE PORN PUBLISHER RECALLS WITH AMUSEMENT IN STICKY. ??WHAT HE??S REALLY TELLING ME IS HE SPENT A LOT OF TIME JERKING OFF TO HUSTLER OVER THE YEARS.? IN ADDITION TO THESE BROADER STROKES THE DOCUMENTARY ALSO TAKES A DEEP DIVE INTO THE FINER POINTS OF MASTURBATION TRIVIA. IF YOU DIDN??T KNOW THAT THE MODERN-DAY VIBRATOR WAS DEVELOPED OUT OF STEAM-POWERED MACHINES USED TO TREAT HYSTERIA OR THAT MANY RELIGIONS REGARD MASTURBATION AS SINFUL BECAUSE OF AN OBSCURE OLD TESTAMENT STORY ABOUT A MAN WHO USED THE ??PULL OUT METHOD? WHILE HAVING SEX WITH HIS LATE BROTHER??S WIFE STICKY??S GOT YOU COVERED.

WHILE AIRBNB IS FAST BECOMING AN ESSENTIAL TOOL FOR TRAVELING ON THE CHEAP (OR CHEAPER) THE HOUSE-SHARING SITE HAS EARNED SOME CRITICISM. SOME AIRBNB HOSTS HAVE SKIRTED STATE LAWS TO LEASE THROUGH THE SITE??AND THERE ARE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ADVOCATES WHO ARGUE AIRBNB LIMITS THE HOUSING RENTAL MARKET AND THUS RAISES PRICES WHEN LONG-TERM RENTALS BECOME EVEN SCARCER.

HOPEFULLY I??M DOING ALL RIGHT BY MYSELF. IT WOULD BE GREAT TO HAVE SOMEONE NEXT TO ME TO SHARE THE PRESSURE BUT THE TIME WILL COME AND WHATEVER HAPPENS HAPPENS.? WHILE THERE WAS A SWEET KIND OF NAIVETY TO HARRY??S ??I WANT A WIFE? STATEMENT ONE HAS TO WONDER IF IT WAS REALLY THE SMARTEST MOVE. BY DRAWING ATTENTION BOTH TO HIS LACK OF A FIANC??E AND HIS DESIRE TO HAVE ONE HE HAS INVITED PRESSURE AND BROUGHT ON HIMSELF THE ROLE OF THE MALE JENNIFER ANISTON??ENDLESSLY PITIED IN THE MEDIA AS ??LONELY HARRY.???Ÿ WHILE HARRY IS NOT IN LOVE THE TRUTH IS HE??S FAR FROM LONELY ALTHOUGH HE IS ONE OF THE LAST OF HIS GROUP TO BE UN-BETROTHED. HIS CHIEF COHORT TOM INSKIP RECENTLY GOT ENGAGED WHILE PALS CHARLIE GILKES AND GUY PELLY HAVE BOTH GOT MARRIED. EVEN MEGA-RICH FILMMAKER ARTHUR LANDON ANOTHER OLD BUDDY FROM ETON IS REPORTEDLY ENGAGED TO ALESSANDRA?ŸBALAZS THE DAUGHTER OF HOTELIER ANDRE. HARRY IS A VERY SOCIABLE YOUNG MAN AND HAS LOTS OF MATES WHO ARE INCREDIBLY LOYAL TO HIM. HE HAS MERCIFULLY DEVELOPED A KNACK FOR STAYING BELOW THE RADAR (AND OFF CAMERA) WHEN OUT AND ABOUT IN LONDON BUT THE ODD STORY STILL LEAKS OUT--FOR EXAMPLE THE SUN RECENTLY WROTE ABOUT HARRY AND HIS FRIENDS ON A NIGHT OUT AT SOHO FARMHOUSE THE NEW SOHO HOUSE OUTPOST IN OXFORDSHIRE. THE PAPER QUOTED A SOURCE AS SAYING ??INITIALLY THEY WERE DRINKING AT A BIG TABLE INSIDE. BUT AT ABOUT MIDNIGHT THEY MOVED OUTSIDE TO PLAY BEER PONG IN THE HOTEL??S COURTYARD. THEY STAYED UP UNTIL 2:30 AM AND WERE CAUSING QUITE A RACKET BUT NO ONE HAD THE GUTS TO TELL THEM TO KEEP THE NOISE DOWN AS IT WAS PRINCE HARRY. ??ONE OF THE GIRLS HAD A FLAMBOYANT MULTI-COLORED FAKE FUR COAT WHICH HARRY NABBED AND STRUTTED AROUND IN. EVERYONE WAS HAVING A WHALE OF A TIME.? THIS SOUNDS ABOUT PAR FOR THE COURSE. SOME OF HIS ACQUAINTANCES SUSPECT THAT HARRY IS ACTUALLY HOPING TO REUNITE WITH ONE OF HIS EXES AND NOTE THAT WILLIAM BROKE UP WITH KATE BEFORE REUNITING WITH HER. THERE HAVE CERTAINLY BEEN CREDIBLE REPORTS RECEIVED BY THE ROYALIST THAT HARRY??S BREAK-UP WITH CRESSIDA WAS NOT AS CUT-AND-DRIED AS IT MIGHT HAVE SEEMED. ALTHOUGH AS ONE FRIEND SAYS ??SHE IS DATING SOMEONE ELSE NOW? HARRY AND CRESSIE DID GET TOGETHER ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS AFTER THE BIG PUBLIC SPLIT AND FEW OF HARRY??S CIRCLE WOULD BE WILLING TO RULE OUT A LONG TERM RECONCILIATION. THE TWO WERE VERY MUCH IN LOVE WHEN THEY WERE DATING AND THEIR SPLIT CAME AS A HUGE SURPRISE TO COURTIERS AND FRIENDS ALIKE. THE SAME COULD EQUALLY BE SAID OF CHELSY DAVY FOR WHOM MANY SUSPECT HE STILL HOLDS A CANDLE. ?Ÿ SO WHY DESPITE HIS APPARENT WILINGNESS TO DO SO CAN??T HARRY GET HITCHED? THE OFT-REHEARSED PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT FEW OF THE RICH YOUNG AND OFTEN TITLED WOMEN HARRY HANGS OUT WITH ARE PREPARED TO CONTEMPLATE THE SACRIFICE OF PRIVACY THAT LIFE IN THE ROYAL GOLDFISH BOWL WOULD ENTAIL. BUT THIS IS ONLY HALF THE STORY SOURCES SAY WHO TELL THE ROYALIST THAT HARRY IS STILL ACTING LIKE AN ADOLESCENT IN MANY WAYS. AND IT??S NOT JUST THE BOOZY NIGHTS OUT WITH HIS PALS. THE OTHER WORD THAT ONE CONSISTENTLY HEARS FROM THOSE WHO KNOW HIM WHEN HARRY IS THE SUBJECT OF CONVERSATION IS ??IMMATURITY.?? THE TRUTH IS THAT HARRY MAY STILL HAVE TO DO SOME GROWING UP BEFORE HE TIES THE KNOT. ,22834.0

1235,10322327.0,2016-01-27T05:01:00+00:00,BERNIE SANDERS ISN??T ELECTABLE AND HERE??S WHY,THE BLUNT TRUTH: I JUST CAN??T SEE BERNIE SANDERS WINNING A GENERAL ELECTION. THREE MONTHS AGO I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE MAYBE. BUT WATCHING THE CAMPAIGN UNFOLD AS IT HAS AND GIVEN SOME TIME TO PONDER HOW CIRCUMSTANCES MIGHT PLAY THEMSELVES OUT I??VE BECOME LESS CONVINCED THAT HE COULD BEAT ANY OF THE REPUBLICANS. HE??D PROBABLY HAVE THE BEST SHOT AGAINST TED CRUZ. BUT IN THAT CASE AS WE NOW KNOW MIKE BLOOMBERG WOULD GET IN AND I THINK HE??D BE FORMIDABLE BUT I DON??T WANT TO GET INTO WHY HERE. THAT??S ANOTHER COLUMN IF INDEED IT EVER NEEDS TO BE WRITTEN. THIS COLUMN IS ABOUT SANDER??S CHANCES WHICH I THINK ARE VIRTUALLY NIL FOR TWO REASONS. REASON ONE: HE??S NOT AN ENROLLED DEMOCRAT. UNDERSTAND THAT I SAY THIS NOT AS A JUDGMENT ON HIM BUT AS A DESCRIPTION OF WHAT WOULD SURELY BECOME WERE HE THE NOMINEE A DEEP PRACTICAL LIABILITY. LET ME EXPLAIN. THAT HE??S NOT AN ENROLLED DEMOCRAT DOESN??T MATTER OBVIOUSLY TO HIS FANS. I??M SURE IT DOESN??T MATTER TO MOST RANK-AND-FILE DEMOCRATS. IT DOESN??T MATTER TO ME. BUT YOU??D BETTER BELIEVE IT MATTERS TO DEMOCRATIC OFFICE HOLDERS AND PARTY OFFICIALS??MEMBERS OF CONGRESS STATE LEGISLATORS GOVERNORS MAYORS NATIONAL COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND STATE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THESE PEOPLE ARE DEMOCRATS AND THEY??RE DEMOCRATS FOR A REASON. IT??S IMPORTANT TO THEM. A PARTY??S NOMINEE TO THESE PEOPLE NEEDS TO LEAD THE PARTY??HE OR SHE NEEDS TO BE THE COUNTRY??S #1 DEMOCRAT. SANDERS HAS NEVER BEEN A DEMOCRAT WHICH IS FINE IT??S SERVED HIM WELL. BUT EVEN AS HE MADE THE DECISION TO SEEK THE PRESIDENCY AS A DEMOCRAT HE DOESN??T SEEM TO HAVE MADE ANY EFFORT TO ACT LIKE HE CARES ABOUT THE PARTY HE WANTS TO LEAD. POLITICO IN EARLY JANUARY PUBLISHED AN INTERESTING NEWS STORY COMPARING CLINTON??S AND SANDERS??S FUND-RAISING OPERATIONS. CLINTON RAISED MORE THAN $100 MILLION IN 2015 AND SANDERS $73 MILLION. BUT HERE WAS THE KEY THING: IN ADDITION TO THAT $100 MILLION CLINTON BAGGED FOR HERSELF SHE RAISED ANOTHER $18 MILLION FOR DEMOCRATS AROUND THE COUNTRY. THE SANDERS FIGURE? ZERO. THERE??S A LOT I DON??T KNOW ABOUT LIFE. BUT I KNOW THIS: DEMOCRATIC OFFICE HOLDERS KEEP TABS ON THAT SORT OF THING. NOW MAYBE SOME OF THEM DIDN??T WANT BERNIE SANDERS AT THEIR FUND-RAISERS BUT THAT WOULDN??T HAVE PREVENTED THE SANDERS OPERATION FROM WRITING CHECKS TO PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AS A KIND OF DOWN PAYMENT WHICH APPARENTLY DID NOT HAPPEN. ALSO SANDERS COULD JUST SAY AT ANY TIME ??YOU KNOW WHAT? I??M A DEMOCRAT NOW.? HE CANNOT TECHNICALLY ENROLL AS ONE BECAUSE VERMONT HAS OPEN NON-PARTY REGISTRATION. HE COULD HOWEVER SIMPLY SAY IT BUT HE HASN??T. HE CAUCUSES WITH THE DEMOCRATS IN THE SENATE BUT THAT??S JUST BECAUSE ANY SENATOR HAS TO CHOOSE ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER. PARTLY AS A RESULT OF THIS AND FOR OTHER REASONS SANDERS HAS VERY LITTLE DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT. HE HAS ONE DEMOCRATIC MEMBER OF CONGRESS KEITH ELLISON OF MINNESOTA (OUT OF 232) AND ACCORDING TO THE RELEVANT WIKIPEDIA PAGE JUST 115 DEMOCRATIC STATE LEGISLATORS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. ACTUALLY THAT??S NOT ACROSS 50 STATES IT??S ACROSS ONLY 14 STATES. OF THE 115 94 ARE FROM NEW ENGLAND: MAINE 37 VERMONT 29 NEW HAMPSHIRE 19 CONNECTICUT FIVE MASSACHUSETTS FOUR. THE VERMONT NUMBER OF 29 IS PARTICULARLY INTERESTING BECAUSE THE VERMONT GENERAL ASSEMBLY (WHICH INCLUDES BOTH HOUSES) HAS 103 DEMOCRATS MEANING THAT SANDERS DOESN??T HAVE EVEN ONE-THIRD OF THE DEMOCRATS IN HIS OWN STATE. MAYBE 115 SOUNDS LIKE A QUASI-RESPECTABLE FIGURE TO YOU. BUT THERE ARE 3175 DEMOCRATIC STATE LEGISLATORS IN AMERICA (.PDF). SO 115 IS NOTHING. AND AGAIN THE VAST MAJORITY COME FROM STATES RIGHT IN HIS NEIGHBORHOOD. WHERE ARE THE OTHERS FROM? ACCORDING TO THIS LIST TO TAKE STOCK OF SOME LARGE STATES AND KEY SWING STATES THERE??S ONE FROM OHIO ZERO FROM FLORIDA ZERO FROM VIRGINIA ZERO FROM COLORADO ZERO FROM NEW MEXICO ONE FROM NEVADA TWO FROM NEW YORK ONE FROM ILLINOIS AND FROM CALIFORNIA PENNSYLVANIA AND MICHIGAN ZERO ZERO AND ZERO. NOW MY ARGUMENT IS NOT THAT ENDORSEMENTS MATTER THAT MUCH. RATHER THE IMPORTANT PART IS THE LIKELY CONSEQUENCE OF THIS LACK OF SUPPORT. SAY IT??S LATE SPRING AND SOMEHOW OR ANOTHER SANDERS IS CHARGING TOWARD THE NOMINATION. HE??LL PICK UP SOME MORE DEMOCRATIC ENDORSERS IN SAFE LIBERAL DISTRICTS IN STATES THAT HE WON. BUT HERE??S WHAT??S GOING TO HAPPEN. EVERY ONE OF THOSE ROUGHLY 3200 ELECTED OFFICIALS IS GOING TO CONDUCT A POLL OF HIS OR HER DISTRICT TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER ASSOCIATION WITH SANDERS HELPS OR HURTS. IT??S MY GUESS THAT FOR A LOT OF THEM??AND I WOULD SAY THE SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THEM??THE ANSWER IS GOING TO BE ??HURTS.? AND EVEN IF THAT??S NOT THE CASE THESE LEGISLATORS WILL SOUND OUT AS THEY INEVITABLY DO THEIR TOP DONORS AND THEIR DISTRICTS?? MAJOR EMPLOYERS. HOW MANY SANDERS ENTHUSIASTS ARE GOING TO BE FOUND AMONG THOSE TWO GROUPS? THESE LEGISLATORS WILL KEEP THEIR DISTANCE FROM SANDERS. THEY WON??T DO THE THINGS THAT PARTY PEOPLE NORMALLY DO FOR THEIR NOMINEE??GO OUT AND MAKE SPEECHES SHARE VOTER INFORMATION GIVE TIPS ABOUT THE DISTRICT THAT ONLY THEY KNOW AND SO ON. THIS WILL VARY FROM DISTRICT TO DISTRICT AND STATE TO STATE BUT THE SUM AND SUBSTANCE WILL LIKELY BE IF I??M RIGHT THAT IN A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT JURISDICTIONS THE MESSAGE OF THE STATE AND LOCAL DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES AND PARTY INFRASTRUCTURES TO SANDERS WILL BE: YOU??RE ON YOUR OWN PAL. POLITICIANS THINK OF THEIR OWN NECKS FIRST AND THEY??RE FEARFUL OF THE UNKNOWN AND ARE OVERLY CAUTIOUS ON MATTERS LIKE THIS ANYWAY. SO THAT??S THE FIRST REASON: HAVING NEVER BEEN A DEMOCRAT AND HAVING EVEN NOT GIVEN THEM ANY OF HIS MONEY IN THIS PAST YEAR SANDERS JUST ISN??T GOING TO GET MUCH HELP FROM DEMOCRATS. THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HASN??T NOMINATED SOMEONE WHO WASN??T AN ENROLLED MEMBER OF THE PARTY SINCE I BELIEVE 1872 WHEN IT CHOSE NEWSPAPERMAN HORACE GREELEY (I??M STILL CHECKING ON GEN. WINFIELD SCOTT 1880 BUT EVEN IF IT WAS HE THAT??S A LONG TIME AGO). NOW THE SECOND REASON. I THINK SANDERS IS UNIQUELY VULNERABLE TO SCORCHING FOREIGN-POLICY ATTACKS. SCORCHING. HE??D BE SUBJECT TO STINGING ATTACKS ON DOMESTIC POLICY TOO BUT ON DOMESTIC POLICY I??D IMAGINE HE CAN HOLD HIS OWN: ON ECONOMICS AND HEALTH POLICY AND MONETARY POLICY WHATEVER YOU THINK OF HIS PROPOSALS HE CLEARLY KNOWS THE NUTS AND BOLTS. ON FOREIGN POLICY THAT??S NOT SO CLEAR AT ALL. IT??S NOT HIS LEFTY PAST HERE THAT I??M MAINLY TALKING ABOUT ALTHOUGH YOU??D BETTER BELIEVE THAT REPUBLICANS WOULD MAKE SURE EVERY VOTER IN AMERICA KNEW ABOUT THAT AND THEY??D LIE ABOUT ITS EXTENT TO BOOT. BUT EVEN PUTTING THAT TO THE SIDE THE ISSUE IS HIS APPARENT LACK OF INTEREST OVER ALL THESE YEARS IN FOREIGN POLICY. THE WORLD IS IN A PRETTY PARLOUS STATE RIGHT NOW SO I??D BET FOREIGN POLICY WILL MATTER MORE IN THIS ELECTION THAN IT USUALLY DOES EVEN WITHOUT A BIG EVENT IN OCTOBER. ONE FACTOR THAT GREATLY BENEFITED BILL CLINTON IN 1992 IS THAT THE COLD WAR HAD ENDED AND FOREIGN POLICY WAS LOW ON VOTERS?? RADAR SCREENS. SANDERS WON??T BE SO LUCKY. I COULD WRITE THE AD MYSELF AND IT WOULD BE CRUSHING BUT I DON??T WANT TO GIVE THEM IDEAS. REST ASSURED THEY??LL THINK OF THEM ON THEIR OWN. AND NOW HERE??S WHERE MY FIRST AND SECOND REASONS RELATE TO EACH OTHER. IF A NOMINEE HAS STRONG BACKING FROM HIS PARTY WHEN THOSE ATTACKS COME THE OTHER FOLKS WILL HAVE HIS BACK. IF HE DOESN??T THEY WON??T. MIND YOU IT IS NOT MY INTENT HERE TO SCOLD SANDERS EVEN THOUGH MANY READERS WILL TAKE IT THAT WAY. MY INTENT IS JUST TO DESCRIBE WHAT I THINK WOULD BE THE REALITY. WHEN THE RIGHT STARTED SAVAGING SANDERS OVER FOREIGN POLICY (AND OVER SOCIALISM TOO OF COURSE) THE BULK OF THE SUPPORT SYSTEMS THAT ARE USUALLY THERE FOR A CANDIDATE UNDER ATTACK WON??T BE. NOW SINCE I KNOW THIS COLUMN IS GOING TO FACE PLENTY OF REBUTTAL LET ME SPEND TWO PARAGRAPHS PRE-BUTTING MYSELF. IT??S POSSIBLE THAT IF SANDERS WON THE NOMINATION LOCAL DEMOCRATS WOULD BY AND LARGE JUST SAY ??OKAY HE??S OUR GUY? AND THEY??D GET BEHIND HIM. I DON??T THINK SO FOR REASONS STATED ABOVE BUT I CONCEDE THAT IT??S POSSIBLE WITH SO MUCH AT STAKE. AND HE STILL WOULD HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE UNIONS WHO THESE DAYS DO MOST OF THE GET-OUT-THE-VOTE LEGWORK. SO IT??S POSSIBLE THAT A LACK OF SUPPORT FROM DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES IN SWING (AND OTHER) STATES WON??T BE THAT SEVERE AND WON??T MEAN AS MUCH AS I SUSPECT IT WILL MEAN. ON FOREIGN POLICY WE SEE FROM HIS DEBATES WITH CLINTON WHAT SANDERS??S REPLY WILL BE: I OPPOSED THE IRAQ WAR AND I WAS RIGHT. AND SECOND I SUPPORT BARACK OBAMA??S FOREIGN POLICY SO I??LL JUST DO MORE OF THAT. WHO KNOWS THAT MIGHT BE ENOUGH. MY SUSPICION IS THAT IT WILL NOT BE. IT CERTAINLY WON??T BE AGAINST DONALD TRUMP WHO ALSO OPPOSED THE WAR IN IRAQ MAKING THAT ISSUE A WASH BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM. BUT I SUSPECT THAT AS A GENERAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN PROGRESSES SANDERS WILL HAVE A HARDER AND HARDER TIME LEANING ON A DECISION HE MADE 14 YEARS AGO EVEN THOUGH IT WAS THE RIGHT ONE. SO THAT LEADS TO MY FIRST STIPULATION. I COULD BE WRONG. I??VE BEEN WRONG BEFORE AND I??LL BE WRONG AGAIN. DESPITE WHAT SOME OF YOU ARE GOING TO SAY ON TWITTER AND ELSEWHERE I DON??T PRESUME TO KNOW EVERYTHING. STIPULATION NUMBER TWO: THOUGH I ADMIRE HILLARY CLINTON MY ARGUMENT DOESN??T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH HER. IT??S NOT A BRIEF FOR CLINTON. SHE HAS A NUMBER OF FLAWS. SHE LACKS THE NATURAL POL??S EXUBERANT CHARISMA SHE HAS MADE ERRORS OF STRATEGIC JUDGMENT IN HER CAREER THAT MAKE ME WONDER HOW EFFECTIVE SHE??D BE AT NEGOTIATING WITH REPUBLICANS (OR ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS) AND THOUGH I DON??T THINK SHE??S CORRUPT THIS STONEWALLING REFLEX OF HERS IS JUST TERRIBLE AND IT??S KIND OF SHOCKING AFTER ALL THESE YEARS THAT SHE CAN??T SEE HOW POORLY IT HAS SERVED HER. AND SHE COMES WITH RISK. AS I WROTE MONDAY I DOUBT SHE??LL BE INDICTED OVER THE EMAIL BUSINESS. BUT SOMETHING SHORT OF THAT COULD STILL PROVE POLITICALLY PROBLEMATIC: AN FBI REPORT THAT GIVES REPUBLICANS ENOUGH GRIST TO GRIND THROUGH THE ATTACK-AD MILL THIS FALL SAY. SO WHAT I??VE WRITTEN HERE DOESN??T HAVE TO DO WITH HER. JOE BIDEN COULD BE THE MAINSTREAM CANDIDATE OR JOHN KERRY OR JOE MANCHIN OR CLAIRE MCCASKILL OR A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR OR ANYBODY AND I??M CERTAIN I??D STILL THINK THE SAME THING. MY FEELING THAT SANDERS COULD WIN A GENERAL ELECTION WAS NEVER STRONG BASED ON THE USUAL STUFF I.E. 74-YEAR-OLD SOCIALIST FROM VERMONT. BUT RECENTLY I??VE BEEN REFLECTING ON THESE TWO MATTERS HIS LACK OF AFFILIATION WITH THE PARTY WHOSE STANDARD HE WANTS TO BEAR AND HIS UNIQUE VULNERABILITY TO ATTACK ON FOREIGN POLICY AT A TIME WHEN THOSE ISSUES ARE MUCH MORE IN THE FOREFRONT OF VOTERS?? MINDS THAN USUAL. AS I??VE WRITTEN BEFORE CURRENT GENERAL ELECTION HEAD-TO-HEAD POLLING IS MEANINGLESS SINCE CONSERVATIVES HAVEN??T YET SPENT A DOLLAR ATTACKING HIM. IF HE??S THE NOMINEE THEY??RE GOING TO SPEND AT LEAST FIVE HUNDRED MILLION OF THEM DOING THAT. AND SOME DEMOCRATS MORE LIKELY A LOT OF DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO RUN AWAY FROM HIM. I CAN??T SEE HOW THAT ENDS WELL. ,92585.0
714,9992576.0,2016-01-16T05:03:00+00:00,BEHIND THE DIRTY SEXY SAGA OF THE SPANISH CROWN,IN ONE OF THE MOST HUMILIATING EVENTS TO STRIKE EUROPEAN ROYALTY IN LIVING MEMORY THE INFANTA CRISTINA THE ONCE-GLAMOROUS LITTLE SISTER OF THE KING OF SPAIN THIS WEEK BECAME THE FIRST SPANISH ROYAL EVER TO APPEAR IN COURT CHARGED WITH A CRIMINAL ACT. THE SIXTH-IN-LINE TO THE THRONE MADE HER RELUCTANT APPEARANCE ON MONDAY ALONGSIDE HER HUSBAND INAKI URDANGARIN A FORMER OLYMPIC HANDBALL PLAYER AMIDST TIGHT SECURITY. THE TWO STAND ACCUSED OF BEING PART OF A NETWORK OF INDUSTRIAL-LEVEL CORRUPTION AND TAX EVASION AND OF EFFECTIVELY ROBBING THE COUNTRY OF SEVERAL MILLION EUROS WHILE IT WAS EXPERIENCING ITS WORSE FINANCIAL CRISIS IN DECADES WHICH RESULTED IN A NATIONAL BAIL-OUT BY THE EUROPEAN AUTHORITIES. CRISTINA??AGED 50 SHE IS THE YOUNGEST DAUGHTER OF FORMER?ŸQUEEN SOFIA AND KING JUAN CARLOS?Ÿ(WHO ABDICATED IN 2014 AFTER AN EMBARRASSING SCANDAL WHEN HE WAS CAUGHT ELEPHANT HUNTING)??FACES?ŸCHARGES OF TAX FRAUD IN?ŸA CASE INVOLVING MONEY LAUNDERING AND EMBEZZLEMENT OF SOME ?ª5.6 MILLION OF PUBLIC FUNDS. THE NEW KING HER BROTHER FELIPE HAS CUT ALL TIES WITH HIS ONCE-BELOVED SISTER. IN A PROCESS KNOWN IN SPANISH ROYAL CIRCLES AS ??THE FIREWALL?? FELIPE HAS SOUGHT TO METICULOUSLY SEVER EVERY LAST THREAD CONNECTING HIM WITH HIS DISGRACED SISTER. HE IS DOING SO WITH GOOD REASON. THE GREAT FEAR FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT IS THAT A DESPERATE CRISTINA HER HUSBAND??OR ONE OF THE 17 OTHER DEFENDANTS IN THE CASE??MAY RESORT TO CLAIMING THAT THE ROYAL FAMILY KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON ALONG. SUCH A CHARGE WHETHER PROVED OR NOT COULD TOPPLE THE MONARCHY. INDEED THE EXTENT OF WHAT IS AT STAKE FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT IS ONE OF THE FACTORS THAT MADE SO MANY OBSERVERS OF SPANISH SOCIETY SKEPTICAL THIS CASE WOULD EVER REACH COURT. IT IS A SAD END TO WHAT HAD ONCE SEEMED THE EPITOME OF A GLAMOROUS ROYAL FAIRY STORY. THE YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL COUPLE MET IN 1996 DURING THE OLYMPIC GAMES IN ATLANTA WHEN URDANGARIN REPRESENTED SPAIN AND MARRIED A YEAR LATER. THE KING MADE THEM DUKE AND DUCHESS OF PARMA AN ANCIENT TITLE FROM MALLORCA??THE REGION IN WHICH BY TREMENDOUS IRONY THEY ARE NOW STANDING TRIAL. THEY LIVED IT SEEMED A CHARMED LIFE. THEIR LAVISH LIFESTYLE INCLUDED THE PURCHASE OF A ?ª7M APARTMENT IN BARCELONA IN 1999 DUBBED ??THE PALACE?? (THEY NOW LIVE IN GENEVA). THE MONEY THEY ARE ALLEGED TO HAVE EMBEZZLED WENT THROUGH THE NOOS INSTITUTE A NON-PROFIT SPORTS ORGANIZATION ON WHICH CRISTINA SAT AS A BOARD MEMBER AND WHICH WAS DIRECTED BY URDANGARIN. WHEN THE ALLEGATIONS CAME TO LIGHT IN NOVEMBER 2011 THE PUBLIC QUICKLY TURNED AGAINST THEM. ONCE THE OLD KING STEPPED DOWN DECISIONS WERE LED BY THE NEW QUEEN OF SPAIN LETIZIA ORTIZ A FORMER NEWSREADER AND JOURNALIST WHOM WHITER-THAN-WHITE FELIPE VI MARRIED IN 2004. INTENSELY MEDIA-SAVVY (IN 2000 SHE WAS THE WINNER OF THE MADRID PRESS ASSOCIATION??S LARRA AWARD FOR MOST ACCOMPLISHED JOURNALIST UNDER 30) QUEEN LETIZIA INITIATED THE ??FIREWALL?? POLICY SOURCES SAY AND IT WAS SHE WHO IS SAID TO HAVE ENCOURAGED JUAN CARLOS TO ISSUE AN UNPRECEDENTED PUBLIC STATEMENT STATING THAT ??JUSTICE IS THE SAME FOR EVERYONE? AS THE STORM CLOUDS GATHERED AROUND CRISTINA. SHE HAS ALSO SEEN TO IT THAT CRISTINA CONTINUES TO BE AS LITTLE-IDENTIFIED WITH THE ROYAL FAMILY AS POSSIBLE. LAST WEEKEND FOR EXAMPLE SHE WAS NOT INVITED TO ATTEND THE 12TH DAY OF CHRISTMAS CELEBRATIONS D??A DE LOS REYES ONE OF THE BIGGEST FAMILY DAYS?? IN THE SPANISH CALENDAR. DIEGO TORRES URDANGAR??N??S FORMER BUSINESS PARTNER HAS PREVIOUSLY STATED THAT THE KING??S BROTHER-IN-LAW NEVER MADE A MOVE WITHOUT PALACE APPROVAL. IT IS ALLEGED THAT URDANGAR??N BENEFITED FROM MILLIONS OF EURO IN BALEARIC GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AWARDED WITHOUT BIDS. FEW EVER REALLY BELIEVED THAT CRISTINA WOULD END UP IN THE DOCK BUT A TENACIOUS LOCAL PROSECUTOR WITH REPUBLICAN TENDENCIES HAS STUCK TO THE CASE LIMPET-LIKE. AND THUS IT WAS WITH HEAD BOWED AND LIPS TIGHTLY SEALED CRISTINA AND URDANGAR??N WERE AMONG 17 DEFENDANTS LED INTO COURT ON MONDAY THIS WEEK FOR THE OPENING SHOTS IN A TRIAL THAT MIGHT LAST THE BEST PART OF A YEAR. THE PROSECUTION ALLEGES THAT CRISTINA COULD NOT HAVE BEEN UNAWARE OF HER HUSBAND??S ALLEGEDLY DUBIOUS BUSINESS DEALINGS. SHE IS ACCUSED OF EMPTYING THE ACCOUNTS OF NOOS VIA A COMPANY CALLED AIZOON FALSELY BILLING THE INSTITUTE AND THEN PASSING THE INVOICES OFF AS TAX-DEDUCTIBLE PERSONAL EXPENSES SUCH AS RENTING HER OWN HOME COACHING SERVICES CHILDREN??S PARTIES AN AFRICAN SAFARI AND CATERING FOR HER BIRTHDAY. BUT HER LAWYER JES?§S MAR??A SILVA DESCRIBED THE CASE AGAINST HER AS ??A VIOLATION OF HER FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS? THAT WOULD HAVE ??THE MOST ESTEEMED SPANISH JURISTS TURNING IN THEIR GRAVES.? WHETHER OR NOT CRISTINA CAN WALK AWAY FROM THIS CASE UNSCATHED IS A QUESTION ON WHICH THE FUTURE OF THE SPANISH MONARCHY MAY WELL HANG. ,45019.0

SPOCK WAS THE CANDIDATE FOR THE PEOPLE??S PARTY A NOW-DEFUNCT POLITICAL PARTY THAN RAN IN TWO PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS. SPOCK CALLED FOR A MAXIMUM INCOME OF $55000 AND A MINIMUM ANNUAL INCOME OF $6500 FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR. SPOCK??S IDEAS WERE MORE IN LINE WITH LIBERTY UNION AS COMPARED TO MCGOVERN??S IDEAS SANDERS SAID AT THE TIME. SANDERS ALSO SERVED AS A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTOR FOR THE SOCIALIST WORKERS?? PARTY IN 1980 SOMETHING THAT HE ACKNOWLEDGED IN A 1988 TELEVISION APPEARANCE. THE GROUP AT THE TIME WAS A TROTSKYIST PARTY THAT PRESSED FOR THE ABOLITION OF CAPITALISM AND THE PEACEFUL ESTABLISHMENT OF SOCIALISM. ??I WAS ASKED TO PUT MY NAME ON THE BALLOT AND I DID THAT??S TRUE? SANDERS SAID IN THE 1988 APPEARANCE. BUT HE INSISTED HE WAS NEVER A MEMBER OF THE TROTSKYIST PARTY. SANDERS RAN AND WON A NARROW RACE FOR MAYOR OF BURLINGTON VERMONT IN 1981. THOUGH HE RAN AS AN INDEPENDENT HE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS A SOCIALIST MAYOR. HE CONTINUED TO BE AN INDEPENDENT UNTIL HE PUT HIMSELF ON THE BALLOT AS A DEMOCRAT IN THE CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL RACE. THE NOW-SENATOR??S ASSOCIATIONS WITH VARIOUS LEFTISTS GROUPS SEEM NOT TO HAVE SUNK IN -- IF THEY MATTER AT ALL. A LARGE NUMBER OF DEMOCRATS SEEM NOT TO MIND: OVER THE PAST YEAR SANDERS HAS GRADUALLY NARROWED A LARGE IOWA VOTER GAP WITH FELLOW DEMOCRAT HILLARY CLINTON. WITH JUST DAYS LEFT TO GO UNTIL IOWANS CAUCUS THE HUFFINGTON POST'S POLL TRACKER SHOWS SANDERS JUST THREE PERCENTAGE POINTS BACK FROM THE FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE. BUT THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY AND THE GENERAL ELECTION ARE TWO DIFFERENT CONTESTS: AMONG THE AMERICAN ELECTORATE THERE IS MUCH LESS INTEREST IN ELECTING A SOCIALIST. 50 PERCENT OF AMERICANS POLLED BY GALLUP IN JUNE 2015 SAID THEY COULD NOT VOTE FOR A CANDIDATE THAT IDENTIFIED AS A SOCIALIST AS COMPARED TO 47 PERCENT WHO COULD. IN FACT 'SOCIALIST' WAS THE LEAST APPEALING OF THE ATTRIBUTES THAT THE SURVEY COMPANY POLLED. BUT GUMA THE LONGTIME SANDERS-WATCHER SAID SANDERS??

BAY??S NEWEST EXPLODE-A-THON THIS ONE BASED ON THE BENGHAZI ATTACK HAS ALREADY CAPTURED THE ATTENTION??IF NOT AFFECTIONS??OF MANY FAMOUS CONSERVATIVE FIGURES WHO HAVE FOR YEARS INDULGED IN CONSPIRACY-MONGERING ABOUT THE SIEGE. ON FRIDAY PARAMOUNT PICTURES RELEASES THE ACTION-THRILLER 13 HOURS: THE SECRET SOLDIERS OF BENGHAZI WHICH DRAMATIZES THE STORY OF THE SIX-MAN SECURITY TEAM THAT DEFENDED THE U.S. COMPOUND AND CIA ANNEX IN BENGHAZI LIBYA AT THE TIME OF THE 2012 ATTACK. BAY THE PYROTECHNICS-LOVING DIRECTOR WHO GAVE THE WORLD THE MAJESTIC HITS ARMAGEDDON AND TRANSFORMERS HAS PROMISED THAT HE IS NOT MAKING A POLITICAL STATEMENT WITH HIS BENGHAZI PICTURE. ??NO NO THERE IS NO POLITICAL AGENDA? HE EMPHATICALLY TOLD THE HOLLYWOOD REPORTER LATE LAST YEAR.

BUT THE FILM??S BIGGEST FANS MIGHT BE THE CONSPIRACY THEORISTS WHO BELIEVE IN ELABORATE ESPIONAGE PLOTS INSTEAD OF ANY OFFICIAL NARRATIVE OF THE 2012 ATTACK. ??IT'S DEVASTATING IT'S TRUE AND IT REALLY HITS YOU VERY HARD? TOM FITTON PRESIDENT OF THE RIGHT-WING WATCHDOG GROUP JUDICIAL WATCH TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. FITTON PREVIOUSLY FLOATED THE THEORY THAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ACTUALLY WANTED THE MURDERED AMBASSADOR CHRIS STEVENS TO GET KIDNAPPED BY ISLAMISTS INSTEAD. ??ANYONE WHO THINKS THEY UNDERSTAND BENGHAZI YOU REALIZE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND IT UNTIL YOU SEE A MOVIE LIKE THIS. IT DRAMATICALLY AND CONVINCINGLY DEPICTS WHAT HAPPENED THERE? FITTON SAID. FITTON WHO ATTENDED A WASHINGTON D.C.

WHILE HIS CHILD RECOVERS FROM A SUCCESSFUL SURGERY WESLEY LANDERS 32 SITS IN JAIL. HIS WIFE 31-YEAR-OLD MARY ANN LANDERS IS DEAD FROM A REPORTED HEROIN OVERDOSE. AS A RECOVERING HEROIN ADDICT WITH CHILDREN OF MY OWN I WONDERED: HOW COULD THIS HAVE HAPPENED? THE FACTS ARE SHOCKING EVEN TO A SEASONED VETERAN OF ADDICTION LIKE MYSELF: THE MOTHER FOUND DEAD THE FATHER EXTRACTED FROM THE BATHROOM A GUN IN HIS POCKET AND A NEEDLE STILL IN HIS ARM FATEFULLY REVIVED WITH NALOXONE. THE LANDER??S FAMILY PHOTOS ON FACEBOOK AND GOFUNDME REVEAL LITTLE OF A BATTLE WITH HEROIN. BUT PARENTS WHO ABUSE OPIOIDS LEAD A SHADOWY EXISTENCE WHERE ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR SUBSTANCE ABUSE COULD LEAD TO LOSS OF THEIR CHILDREN. EXPOSURE OF CHILDREN TO ILLEGAL DRUG ACTIVITY IS ALSO ADDRESSED IN 33 STATES?? CRIMINAL STATUTES. AS A FORMER HEROIN USER I AM CONTINUALLY GRATEFUL MY CHILDREN WERE BORN LONG AFTER MY ACTIVE ADDICTION. IN MY SEARCH FOR PARENTS WITH DEPENDENCE ON OPIOIDS I WAS SHOCKED WHEN CLOSE TO 20 INDIVIDUALS CONTACTED ME IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS. THEY??RE ADDICTS WITH CHILDREN CHILDREN OF ADDICTS ??FUNCTIONAL USERS? AND THOSE WHO RECOVERED ALONG THE WAY TO PARENTHOOD. ALL WISHED TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS AND NAMES HAVE BEEN CHANGED THROUGHOUT. ??I??VE REALLY WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THIS FOR QUITE A LONG TIME? ONE TOLD ME. HE REPEATEDLY MENTIONED THAT HE HAD NEVER SPOKEN ABOUT ADDICTION WITH ANYONE ELSE. ANOTHER WAS A FATHER WHO LOST HIS CHILDREN DUE TO HEROIN USE. ??IT??S AWFUL? HE WROTE. ??THEY ARE MY WHOLE WORLD. IN FACT THEY ARE PROBABLY THE ONLY REASON I??M STILL ALIVE BECAUSE I WANT TO BE IN THEIR LIFE.? ??I CAN RELATE TO THE [CINCINNATI] STORY? HE SAID. ??WHEN MY DAUGHTER WAS BORN I HAD TO STAY WELL [BY USING HEROIN] FOR THE TWO DAYS WE WERE IN THE HOSPITAL AFTER SHE WAS BORN AND I WAS ON METHADONE WHEN MY SON WAS BORN.? HE SAID HE RECENTLY ??MADE THE DECISION TO TELL MY PARENTS EVERYTHING??[AND] HOPEFULLY GAIN FULL CUSTODY FOR THE TIME BEING UNTIL I CAN GET MY LIFE TOGETHER.? THERE WAS A COMMON THREAD AMONG THE PARENTS I TALKED TO. A MAN WHO USED THE ALIAS JOHN BATT SUMMED IT UP TO ME BY WRITING ??WE HAVE A PROBLEM THAT DOESN??T MEAN WE LOVE OUR CHILDREN ANY LESS. WE WANT THE BEST FOR OUR CHILDREN AND WE WANT THEM TO BE BETTER THAN WE ARE. WE TEACH THEM RIGHT AND WRONG. WE??RE JUST LIKE YOU IMPERFECT.? ADDICT PARENTS ARE NOT UNIQUE IN THEIR STRUGGLE. THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH (NIH) ESTIMATES THAT OVER 2.5 MILLION AMERICANS CURRENTLY ABUSE OPIOIDS AND THE NATIONAL SURVEY ON DRUG USE AND HEALTH (NSDUH) REPORTED 2.2 MILLION CHILDREN LIVE WITH A PARENT WHO IS DEPENDENT ON OR ABUSES ILLICIT DRUGS. IN CASES WHERE HELP IS REQUESTED SYSTEMS ARE FREQUENTLY UNPREPARED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF FAMILY SYSTEMS WHERE SUBSTANCE ABUSE IS AN ISSUE. MANY FAMILIES LIKE THE LANDERS FLY UNDER THE RADAR. AUTUMN LEE IS A SINGLE MOTHER RAISING A TODDLER AND A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD. ??I??VE BEEN FAMILIAR WITH OPIATES FOR ALMOST FIVE YEARS NOW FROM OCCASIONAL USE FOR THE FIRST YEAR OR SO TO?? NOW IV HEROIN? SHE TOLD ME. ??[I STOPPED] FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND NOW I??M BACK TO USING ANYWHERE FROM THREE TO SEVEN DAYS A WEEK.? AFTER AN INCIDENT WHERE AUTUMN??S CHILD ENDED UP AT THE HOSPITAL FOR A SPIKING FEVER ??HER FATHER HAD COME FOR US WITH [DRUGS] FOR ME. WHEN WE GOT HOME I WENT AHEAD AND DID SOME. I FELT LOUSY FOR DOING IT. EVEN THOUGH [MY DAUGHTER] WAS DEEMED HEALTHY IT MADE ME FEEL GUILTY AND PRETTY SELFISH THAT I WAS WILLINGLY DETACHING MYSELF FROM THE SITUATION. NOTHING BAD CAME FROM MY DOSE AND MY STRESSFUL NIGHT/MORNING HAD COME TO AN END. I??M NOT TELLING YOU THIS BECAUSE THE SITUATION WAS CAUSED BY MY USING BUT THAT I CHOSE IT TO COPE.? IN ASKING WHAT SHE FEELS MAKES HER DIFFERENT FROM OTHER PARENTS AUTUMN SAID ??ALONG WITH THE NORMAL PARENTAL STRUGGLES I NEED TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO BE WELL. WHILE I PROBABLY SHOULD BE SPENDING THAT MONEY ON THE KIDS IT??S SPENT ON MYSELF??THOUGH MY GIRLS NEVER GO WITHOUT SO TO SPEAK. THEY ALWAYS COME FIRST. JUST LIKE I WOULD GO WITHOUT FOOD FOR THEM TO EAT I WOULD NEVER PLACE THEM BEHIND MY OWN WELLNESS OR WELLBEING. THEY??RE HAPPY HEALTHY SMART LITTLE LADIES AND THAT WILL ALWAYS BE MY PRIMARY CONCERN??JUST LIKE ANY OTHER PARENT.? AUTUMN TOLD ME THAT SHE ??GETS UP AT 6:30AM TO GET MY OLDEST READY FOR SCHOOL. SOME OF THE TIME SHE WILL GET A RIDE BUT FOR THE MOST PART I WALK HER TO (AND FROM) SCHOOL. AFTER THAT WE DO HOMEWORK DINNER MOVIES/ENTERTAINMENT BATH BED. I KNOW THAT ALL SOUNDS REDUNDANT BUT THAT??S MY DAY.? JOHN BATT WROTE THAT ?MY WIFE HAD BEEN IN PAIN MANAGEMENT FOR SOME SERIOUS ISSUES WITH HER BACK. WHEN SHE STARTED IT WAS LEGITIMATE AND ABUSING THE PRESCRIPTIONS REALLY WASN??T A THOUGHT TO US BUT THAT SOON CHANGED.? THINGS ESCALATED FOR THE COUPLE OVER TIME. ??AS WITH MOST PAIN MANAGEMENT I ASSUME THE PRESCRIPTIONS WERE LOW? HE SAID. ??HOWEVER OVER TIME THE QUANTITIES AND DOSAGE INCREASED. FOR ABOUT THE LAST YEAR SHE WAS PRESCRIBED 360 30MG OXYCODONES ALONG WITH FENTANYL PATCHES AND SOME OTHER MEDICATIONS. WE THOUGHT WE HIT THE LOTTERY AND THAT THERE WAS NO WAY WE WOULD EVER RUN OUT AGAIN. BUT AS IS THE STORY WHAT WOULD LAST US A MONTH BECAME THREE WEEKS THEN TWO AND BY THE END WE SOMEHOW MANAGED TO GO THROUGH THAT IN A WEEK. DURING THIS TIME WE WOULD SUPPLEMENT WITH HEROIN. EVENTUALLY THE PRESCRIPTIONS STOPPED ALTOGETHER AND WE WERE SOLELY USING HEROIN. WE??VE BEEN USING HEROIN VIA IV FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS NOW??WE DIDN??T EVEN REALIZE WE WERE ADDICTED UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE?. JOHN??S STORY ECHOED AUTUMN??S: ??WE ARE LIKE ANY OTHER PARENTS. WE HELP OUR CHILDREN WITH THEIR HOMEWORK WE PLAY AND COLOR. WE HUG AND DANCE. WE TEACH AND DISCIPLINE. AS ADDICTS WE HAVE AS MUCH LOVE IN HEARTS FOR OUR CHILDREN AS A CLEAN PARENT.? THE DIFFERENCE COMES WITH THE LACK OF THE DRUG. ??ONCE WE??RE WELL AGAIN EVERYTHING GOES BACK TO NORMAL? JOHN WROTE. CHILD WELFARE EXPERTS WOULD DISAGREE. ACCORDING TO A REPORT (PDF) ON CHILD WELFARE AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE BEING RAISED BY A DRUG-DEPENDENT PARENT LEAD TO POOR COGNITIVE DELAYED SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT DEPRESSION ANXIETY AND OTHER MENTAL HEALTH SYMPTOMS PHYSICAL HEALTH ISSUES AND SUBSTANCE USE PROBLEMS FOR THE CHILD. USERS ARGUE THAT THE STIGMA SURROUNDING THEIR USE CREATES MANY OF THESE PROBLEMS. UNABLE TO REACH OUT FOR SUPPORT FOR FEAR OF LOSING THEIR CHILDREN PARENTS WITH OPIOID DEPENDENCE ARE FREQUENTLY PUSHED INTO ISOLATION WHERE THEY CANNOT ACCESS RESOURCES THAT ARE WIDELY AVAILABLE FOR PARENTS. ??I THINK THE STIGMA ASSOCIATED WITH ABUSE IS ABHORRENT IN GENERAL? AUTUMN TOLD ME. ??YES THERE ARE SOME VERY SAD CASES BUT A DRUG DOESN??T NECESSARILY DICTATE YOUR PARENTING. JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE HAS VICES DOESN??T MAKE THEM A BAD PERSON OR PARENT??JUST LIKE BEING CLEAN WON??T GUARANTEE A GOOD ONE.? THERE HAS BEEN MUCH SPECULATION IN THE AS TO WHY THE YOUNG PARENTS OVERDOSED IN THE BATHROOM AT THE HOSPITAL. THE CONSENSUS SEEMS TO BE THAT AS USERS FROM OUT OF STATE THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN UNFAMILIAR WITH POTENCY OF THE DRUGS AVAILABLE IN CINCINNATI. IN ADDITION THE AREA SURROUNDING CINCINNATI HAS BEEN PLAGUED BY HEROIN TAINTED WITH FENTANYL (PDF). WHATEVER THE CASE USING IN UNFAMILIAR SURROUNDINGS COULD HAVE EXACERBATED THEIR PROBLEMS LEADING TO THE FATAL OVERDOSE. WESLEY LANDER REMAINS IN JAIL ON NUMEROUS CHARGES AND ONLY TIME WILL TELL IF HE BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO REHABILITATE HIMSELF. CINCINNATI LIKE MANY OF THE TOWNS THE COUPLE WOULD HAVE PASSED AS THEY DROVE ALONG ROUTE 75 HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED BY HEROIN. THERE ARE NOW SO MANY CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE OHIO HAD TO EXPAND TO 20 FAMILY COURTS PEPPERED THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

THE RITUAL IS CALLED ??MAKING THE TEAM.? EVERYTHING COMES TO A HEAD THOUGH IN THE LAST ACT OF WEDNESDAY??S EPISODE WHEN AFTER ATTEMPTING TO COMMIT SUICIDE ERIC ADMITS THAT HE HAD SEX WITH TAYLOR AT THE PARTY AND HAS EMAILS TEXTS AND GRINDR CONVERSATIONS TO PROVE THAT TAYLOR WAS MEETING HIM CONSENSUALLY. THE REASON THAT HE CHOSE TO ATTEMPT SUICIDE RATHER THAN GO TO THE POLICE: HE WAS AFRAID HOW PEOPLE WOULD REACT TO FINDING OUT HE??S GAY.

EVERY TURN OF EVENTS IS ALTERNATELY HEARTBREAKING AND INFURIATING KINDLING A RAGE FIRE BECAUSE OF HOW REALISTICALLY EVERYONE??S ACTIONS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY REACTIONS REFLECT OUR OWN BEHAVIOR AND WORLD. IT TAKES DEFT WRITING TO WEAVE ALL THESE PERSPECTIVES AND ISSUES INTO SUCH A COMPELLING TAPESTRY. THE DIRECTING TOO IS SO UNUSUAL AND POWERFUL. WHEN CHARACTERS ARE IN CONVERSATION WITH A MINOR FIGURE??TAYLOR AND THE WOMAN CONDUCTING HIS RAPE KIT AND EXAM FOR EXAMPLE??THE CAMERA STAYS CENTERED ON THE MAIN CHARACTER EVEN WHEN THEY AREN??T SPEAKING. I??M NOT SURE I??VE SEEN A SHOW THAT PROVIDES A MORE DIGNIFIED SHOWCASE FOR TALENTED ACTRESSES OVER THE AGE OF 40 THAT THE REST OF HOLLYWOOD DOESN??T SEEM TO KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH. FELICITY HUFFMAN REGINA KING HOPE DAVIS AND LILI TAYLOR??TAYLOR DELIVERING A PERFORMANCE THAT IF THERE??S ANYTHING TO BE SAID FOR TASTE SHOULD WIN EVERY ACTING AWARD NEXT YEAR??ALL GET TO PLAY WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT REAL PEOPLE. THEY ARE PEOPLE WHO DON??T CATER TO SYMPATHY OR LIKABILITY BUT WHO ARE SELFISH AND MOTIVATED BY THE SAME THINGS THAT MOTIVATE ALL OF US: PROTECTING OURSELVES AND OUR INTERESTS ESCAPING BLAME AND STICKING TRUE TO OUR OWN BELIEFS NO MATTER HOW MYOPIC THEY MIGHT BE. THEY OPERATE UNDER THE LIMITATIONS OF OUR INTELLIGENCE AND EMPATHY. A LOT OF WHAT THEY DO IS UGLY. BUT IT??S NOT PER SE WRONG. THEY ARE NOT BAD PEOPLE THEY ARE REAL PEOPLE. THEY ARE REAL PEOPLE WHO SHOULD REMIND US OF OURSELVES AND THAT SHOULD MAKE US UNCOMFORTABLE. AND THEN THERE ARE THE PERFORMANCES BY JESSUP JACKSON AND POLLARI. THESE KIDS ARE BROKEN. THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN. AND IT SEEMS LIKE NOTHING CAN BE FIXED. THIS IS A RAVE REVIEW OF A SHOW THAT BECAUSE OF THE SCALE OF ITS AMBITION AND THE RANGE OF ISSUES IT ATTEMPTS TO CONFRONT IS CERTAINLY MESSY AND FLAWED. THAT??S WHAT MAKES IT SEEM ALL THE MORE HUMAN. THAT??S WHAT MAKES IT THE TRUTH. ,29700.0

GOP FRONTRUNNER DONALD TRUMP SHRUGGED OFF A NEW RECRUITMENT VIDEO FOR TERRORIST GROUP AL-SHABAAB THAT USES HIS REMARKS ABOUT BANNING MUSLIMS SAYING ON CBS??S FACE THE NATION: ??WHAT AM I GOING TO DO? I HAVE TO SAY WHAT I HAVE TO SAY. AND YOU KNOW WHAT I HAVE TO SAY? THERE??S A PROBLEM.? ON ABC??S THIS WEEK FORMER NEUROSURGEON BEN CARSON DOWNPLAYED THE DEPARTURES OF HIS CAMPAIGN MANAGER AND COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR LAST WEEK. ASKED IF HE HAD BEEN PLANNING TO FIRE CAMPAIGN MANAGER BARRY BENNETT CARSON SAID ??I WAS GOING TO MAKE SOME VERY SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES AND MR. BENNETT DECIDED THAT HE COULD NOT LIVE WITH THOSE CHANGES.? DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT) DEFENDED HIS GOVERNMENT-FUNDED HEALTH CARE PLAN AS SAVING THE MIDDLE CLASS MONEY EVEN THOUGH A WALL STREET JOURNAL ANALYSIS SAID IT COULD COST $15 TRILLION OVER 10 YEARS. THEN THERE??S SEN. RAND PAUL (R-KY) WHO HASN??T HOSTED A PUBLIC CAMPAIGN EVENT SINCE DEC. 16 IN NEVADA. ON NBC??S MEET THE PRESS HOST CHUCK TODD ASKED PAUL WHERE HE??S BEEN. PAUL AN OPHTHALMOLOGIST SAID HE??S BEEN ATTENDING TO OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES SUCH AS SPENDING TIME WITH HIS FAMILY PERFORMING PRO-BONO SURGERIES AND HOSTING FUNDRAISERS??NOT TO MENTION HIS JOB AS A SENATOR. PAUL WENT AFTER THE VOTING RECORDS OF TWO PRESIDENTIAL RIVALS WHO ARE FELLOW SENATORS TED CRUZ (R-TX) AND MARCO RUBIO (R-FL). ??I MEAN I HAVE A JOB AS SENATOR? PAUL SAID. ??I??M ONE OF THE FEW CANDIDATES THAT ACTUALLY SHOWS UP TO VOTE. BOTH CRUZ AND RUBIO ARE MISSING THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEIR VOTES. BUT I FEEL AN OBLIGATION TO THE TAXPAYER THAT PAYS MY SALARY.? THE KENTUCKY SENATOR FAR OVERSTATED WHEN HE SAID CRUZ AND RUBIO MISSED ??THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEIR VOTES.? WE RATED THE STATEMENT MOSTLY FALSE. PAUL USED HIS BUSY SENATE SCHEDULE AS AN EXCUSE FOR NOT HOSTING MANY CAMPAIGN EVENTS IN THE LATTER HALF OF DECEMBER BUT THERE WASN??T ACTUALLY TOO MUCH GOING ON AT CAPITOL HILL DURING THIS TIME. THE SENATE HAS BEEN IN RECESS SINCE DEC. 18 AND WON??T BE BACK IN SESSION UNTIL JAN. 11. PAUL??S CAMPAIGN SENT OVER DATA FOR MISSED VOTES OVER THE SENATE CAREERS OF PAUL CRUZ AND RUBIO WHICH WE CORROBORATED ON THE WEBSITE GOVTRACK. RUBIO HAS THE WORST ABSENTEE RATE MISSING 13.3 PERCENT OF ALL VOTES. HE??S FOLLOWED BY CRUZ AT 12.4 PERCENT AND FORMER SENATOR HILLARY CLINTON THE DEMOCRATIC FRONTRUNNER AT 9.5 PERCENT. PAUL HAS MISSED CLOSER TO 4 PERCENT JUST AHEAD OF SANDERS. NO CANDIDATE HAS MISSED A ??VAST MAJORITY? OF VOTES OVER HIS OR HER CAREER. THE STORY SHIFTS IF YOU LOOK AT RECENT MONTHS. (WE CHOSE OCTOBER THROUGH DECEMBER BECAUSE GOVTRACK BREAKS ITS DATA INTO THREE-MONTH PERIODS.) RUBIO DID MISS A MAJORITY OF HIS VOTES IN THAT TIMEFRAME SKIPPING 39 OF 67 TOTAL VOTES OR 58 PERCENT. RUBIO MISSED A BIGGIE ON DEC. 18 THE FINALE VOTE ON A MAJOR SPENDING BILL THAT CRUZ AND PAUL VOTED AGAINST. CRUZ DID NOT MISS A MAJORITY OF HIS VOTES IN THAT TIME PERIOD MISSING 29.8 PERCENT COMPARED TO PAUL??S 20.9 PERCENT. NEITHER CRUZ NOR RUBIO MISSED A MAJORITY OF VOTES IN 2015 OVERALL. MORE GUNS LOWER CRIME MURMURS OF LOOMING EXECUTIVE ACTION ON GUN CONTROL FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA ALSO DOMINATED THE SUNDAY CONVERSATION WITH CONSERVATIVE PUNDITS AND POLITICIANS DECRYING ANY UNILATERAL MOVES. TEXAS LT. GOV. DAN PATRICK TOUTED THE NEW LAW IN HIS STATE THAT ALLOWS TEXANS WITH CONCEALED CARRY PERMITS TO CARRY THEIR WEAPONS OPENLY IN MOST PUBLIC AREAS. PATRICK ARGUED THAT SUCH LAWS MAKE STATES SAFER. ??EVERYWHERE THAT WE HAVE MORE CITIZENS CARRYING GUNS CRIME IS LESS? PATRICK SAID. ??THERE??S A STUDY SHOWING THAT WHERE STATES HAVE OPEN CARRY OR CONCEALED CARRY BUT PARTICULARLY OPEN CARRY THE CRIME IS DOWN 25 PERCENT. MURDERS ARE DOWN. HAVING LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS HAVING GUNS IS A GOOD THING.? THE EVIDENCE FOR SUCH A SWEEPING STATEMENT WE FOUND IS LACKING. HIS CLAIM ABOUT CONCEALED-CARRY PERMITS COINCIDING WITH CRIME DECREASES RATES MOSTLY FALSE. PATRICK DID NOT GET BACK TO US BY DEADLINE BUT HE COULD BE REFERENCING ONE STUDY BY ECONOMIST JOHN LOTT PRESIDENT OF THE PRO-GUN CRIME PREVENTION RESEARCH CENTER AND FLUBBING SOME OF THE DETAILS. LOTT??S RESEARCH??WHICH WAS NOT PUBLISHED IN A PEER-REVIEWED JOURNAL BUT ON THE CRIME PREVENTION RESEARCH CENTER??S WEBSITE??LOOKED AT THE INCREASE IN CONCEALED-CARRY PERMITS BUT DID NOT DISCUSS OPEN CARRY AS PATRICK MENTIONED. AND THE 25 PERCENT REFERS TO A DECREASE IN MURDER RATES ACROSS THE NATION AS WELL AS A DECLINE IN VIOLENT CRIME. ACCORDING TO THE STUDY THE NUMBER OF CONCEALED-HANDGUN PERMITS ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAS INCREASED BY 178 PERCENT FROM 4.6 MILLION TO 12.8 MILLION FROM 2007 TO 2015. MEANWHILE NATIONAL MURDER RATES HAVE FALLEN FROM 2007 TO 2014 BY 25 PERCENT FROM 5.6 TO 4.2 HOMICIDES PER 100000. ??OVERALL VIOLENT CRIME ALSO FELL BY 25 PERCENT OVER THAT TIME PERIOD? LOTT WRITES THOUGH HE DOESN??T GIVE THE NUMBERS BEHIND THIS RATE IN THE STUDY. A PEER-REVIEWED STUDY IN THE JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY DIRECTLY REFUTED LOTT??S FINDINGS (AND LOTT IN TURN REFUTED THAT RESEARCH). RESEARCHERS AT TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY LOOKED AT COUNTY-LEVEL CRIME DATA FROM 1998 TO 2010 IN FLORIDA MICHIGAN PENNSYLVANIA AND TEXAS??THE ONLY FOUR STATES WITH AT LEAST A DECADE??S WORTH OF DATA AFTER CONCEALED-CARRY LEGISLATION WAS PASSED. ?Ÿ WHILE THE NUMBER OF CONCEALED-CARRY PERMITS INCREASED IN ALL THE STATES THE CRIME TRENDS VARIED. RAPE AND BURGLARY DECREASED ACROSS ALL FOUR STATES FROM 1998 TO 2010 AND MURDER DECREASED IN MICHIGAN AND TEXAS. HOWEVER ROBBERY AGGRAVATED ASSAULT AND LARCENY INCREASED IN MICHIGAN AND PENNSYLVANIA WHILE MURDER INCREASED IN FLORIDA AND PENNSYLVANIA. ?Ÿ ??WE FOUND NO EFFECT OF INCREASES IN [CONCEALED-CARRY PERMITS] ISSUED IN A COUNTY ON CHANGES IN CRIME RATES? CHARLES PHILLIPS A PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSOR AT TEXAS A&M AND LEAD AUTHOR OF THE STUDY TOLD PUNDITFACT.

BUT FIRST THEY HAD TO LITERALLY SEPARATE FACT FROM FICTION. NAJI PUBLISHED A CHAPTER CONTAINING SCENES OF SEX AND DRUGS IN AN UPCOMING NOVEL THE USE OF LIFE IN EGYPT??S BIGGEST ARTS MAGAZINE AND PROSECUTORS THOUGHT HE WAS DELIVERING A FIRST-PERSON ACCOUNT OF DRUGS AND SEX. ??THE PROSECUTOR DOESN??T UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF THE NOVEL SO HE??S DEALING WITH IT AS IF IT??S A PERSONAL CONFESSION? SAID THE 30-YEAR-OLD NOVELIST. ??SO FOR THEM IT??S NOT THE MAIN CHARACTER OF THE NOVEL IT??S AHMED NAJI WHO WAS HAVING SEX USING A CONDOM AND SMOKING HASH.? NAJI??S CASE IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THE EGYPTIAN LEGAL SYSTEM??S PROPENSITY TO ENABLE BUSYBODIES. SUITS BY RANDOM LAWYERS ARE BROADLY DEFINED AND BASED ON PUBLIC INTEREST LIKE CHANGING FATHER??S DAY TO COINCIDE WITH EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT ABDEL FATTAH EL-SISI??S BIRTHDAY. BUT THE MOST INFAMOUS ARE HISBA SUITS WHICH ALLOW THIRD PARTIES TO SUE TO PROTECT SOCIETY??S UNDERSTANDING OF RIGHT AND WRONG. EGYPT MAY HAVE A SECULAR GOVERNMENT BUT PRUDES STAFF ITS INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER MORALISTS CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SYSTEM. ALL OF THAT APPLIES HERE. NAJI??S BOOK HAD ALREADY PASSED BY EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT CENSORS BUT IT DIDN??T MAKE IT PAST A LAWYER WHO FELT SCANDALIZED WHEN HE READ THE PARAGRAPH OF SEX AND DRUGS. HE GOT SO WORKED UP THE LAWYER ALLEGES THAT HIS BLOOD PRESSURE DROPPED AND HE BECAME ILL. SO THE LAWYER HANI SALAH TAWFIQ BROUGHT CHARGES OF HARMING PUBLIC MORALS AGAINST NAJI AND HIS EDITOR-IN-CHIEF WHO WAS ALSO CHARGED WITH NEGLIGENCE FOR LETTING SUCH CONTENT PASS THROUGH. THE YOUNG AUTHOR COULD BE FINED CLOSE TO $1300 AND GO BEHIND BARS FOR UP TO TWO YEARS. NAJI ISN??T CONCERNED THOUGH AND HIS INDIFFERENCE AND A HIGHBROW CONFIDENCE SHOW IT. DRESSED IN ALL BLACK WITH A CHEVRON MUSTACHE HE ATE DINNER AT A CAIRO KEBAB RESTAURANT DISCUSSING HIS CASE BEFORE AN ART TALK. ??THEY ARE IGNORANT? NAJI SAID OF THE PROSECUTORS. ??THEY FIND THIS KIND OF CASE INVOLVING MEDIA OR JOURNALISTS AS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO APPEAR AS A GUARD OF PUBLIC MORALS AND TO GET SOME ATTENTION.? NAJI DIDN??T GO TO HIS COURT SESSIONS WHICH FORCE DEFENDANTS TO STAND IN A CAGE AND DON??T EXACTLY IMPLY INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY. WHEN PRESIDENT MOHAMED MORSI WENT ON TRIAL AFTER BEING OUSTED HE WOULD YELL THROUGH THE BARS SO THE AUTHORITIES ENCASED IT IN GLASS??ANOTHER INDICATION OF THE RIGHTS OF THE ACCUSED PROVIDED IN CAIRO. SO INSTEAD NAJI SAT A COFFEE SHOP AND LET LAWYERS DO THE TALKING. NAJI??S LAWYERS BROUGHT ON SONALLAH IBRAHIM THE DOYEN OF EGYPT??S OLD NATIONALIST LEFT AS AN EXPERT WITNESS AND PROSECUTORS RESPONDED BY ASKING HIM TO READ THE PASSAGES IN QUESTION. EGYPTIAN COURTS ARE NO STRANGER TO ABSURDITY LIKE THIS. IN FACT ONE OF IBRAHIM??S BOOKS IS ABOUT AN ABSURD COURT IN AN EGYPTIAN RETELLING OF KAFKA??S THE TRIAL. HE REFUSED AND SO DID THE HEAD OF THE CAIRO??S WRITER??S UNION WHOSE TESTIMONY EXPLAINED TO THE COURT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FICTION AND NON-FICTION AND WHY A BARE-BREASTED PAINTING IS NOT PORNOGRAPHIC. NAJI ISN??T SURE IF THE COURT GETS THE NUANCE. THE MAGAZINE THAT PUBLISHED THE EXCERPT AKHBAR AL-ADAB IS NOT A STRANGER TO POLITICAL STRUGGLES DESPITE BEING PUBLICLY OWNED. NAJI HAS BEEN WORKING THERE SINCE HE WAS 18. AFTER REFUSING TO WORK WITH A PRO-MUBARAK EDITOR BEFORE THE 2011 REVOLUTION AND GOING ON AN OUTRIGHT STRIKE AGAINST ANOTHER EDITOR WHOM HE LATER DESCRIBED AS A MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD SHILL AFTER IT HE FINALLY FELL INTO A RHYTHM WITH THE NEW EDITOR. THEY DIDN??T THINK TWICE ABOUT PUBLISHING THE CHAPTER CONTAINING THE SEX SCENE. THE CHAPTER AFTER ALL IS PRETTY VANILLA AND QUOTIDIAN AS FAR AS SEX IN LITERATURE GOES. NAJI AND HIS LAWYERS ALSO BELIEVE THAT THERE COULD BE A CONNECTION WITH THE MILITARY GOVERNMENT??S EFFORT TO UP ITS MORAL CREDENTIALS. NAJI GOT CALLS FROM ONE NEWSPAPER REPORTER TELLING HIM THAT THE PROSECUTOR LEAKED COURT DOCUMENTS TO HIM. SISI RECENTLY APPROVED FORMING A NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR MORALS AND SPECIFICALLY NAMED CULTURAL AND LITERARY SECTORS AS PART OF ITS PURVIEW. BUT IT??S HARD TO TELL IN EGYPT AS TO WHAT MOTIVATES WHAT WRITERS AND NOVELISTS LIKE NAJI SEE AS OBVIOUS REPRESSION. A LOT OF INSTITUTIONS DON??T TALK AND SOMETIMES GO ROGUE TO MAKE ARRESTS OR ISSUE WARRANTS. CONNECTING THE DOTS BETWEEN ATTACKS ON ART OR BASIC FREEDOM OF SPEECH IS DIFFICULT. JUST THIS WEEK AN ART GALLERY AND A MAJOR PUBLISHER WERE BOTH RAIDED IN CAIRO. WHAT IMMEDIATE THREAT THEY POSED TO THE REGIME ISN??T OBVIOUS AND THE CAIRENE CULTURAL SCENE HAS BEEN REELING TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF IT. AS FOR THE LAWYER THAT BROUGHT THE CASE AGAINST NAJI THE WRITER??S LAWYER DOESN??T MINCE WORDS. ??HE IS A STUPID MAN.? ,3765.0

REPUBLICAN DEBATE HELD SIMULTANEOUSLY JUST A FEW MINUTES DOWN THE ROAD IN DOWNTOWN DES MOINES. TRUMP REFUSED TO ATTEND THE DEBATE AFTER A PETTY FIGHT WITH THE NETWORK??S STAR ANCHOR MEGYN KELLY BALLOONED INTO AN ELEMENTARY WAR WITH ITS CEO ROGER AILES. WITH JUST THREE DAYS TO GO BEFORE THE IOWA CAUCUSES TRUMP SEEMED TO BE INVITING THE MEDIA TO CALL THE BLUFF OF HIS CAMPAIGN: HE LEADS THE POLLS IN THE STATE BY 6.8 POINTS ON AVERAGE AND HE CLAIMS HE??LL WIN ??BIG LEAGUE? BUT MANY OF HIS SUPPORTERS HAVE NOT VOTED IN CAUCUSES BEFORE MEANING IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN IF HIS HIGH POLL NUMBERS WILL RESULT IN PEOPLE ACTUALLY COMING OUT TO PULL THE LEVER FOR HIM. BUT LIKE ALL OF TRUMP??S RALLIES THIS ONE TURNED OUT TO BE THE WRONG PLACE TO ANSWER EXISTENTIAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. THEY ARE UNLIKE ANY OTHER POLITICAL EVENT NOT ONLY IN SIZE BUT IN ORGANIZATION. PEOPLE WAIT IN LINE IN THE FREEZING COLD FOR HOURS LIKE THEY MIGHT DO FOR THE NEW IPHONE OR A CRONUT AND THEN PASS THROUGH TSA-LIKE SECURITY TO GET INSIDE. THERE ARE NO CAMPAIGN VOLUNTEERS TAKING DOWN THEIR INFORMATION OR ENCOURAGING THEM TO CAUCUS. EVEN THE VENDORS SELLING ??MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!? HATS AND BUTTONS TEND TO BE UNAFFILIATED WITH THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION. AND FOR EVERY ATTENDEE THERE TO EXPRESS THEIR UNDYING DEVOTION THERE ARE MORE THAN A FEW WHO ARE ONLY RUBBERNECKING. AFTER ALL IF THE FREAKSHOW CAME TO YOUR TOWN YOU??D BE REMISS NOT TO GO SEE IT. HELEN GIALLOMBARDO 55 STOOD JUST A FEW FEET FROM THE TRAILER STARING UP AT TRUMP??S FACE ON THE SCREEN IN A TRANCE-LIKE STATE. HER CURLY BLONDE HAIR WAS BATHED IN ITS REDDISH GLOW. IF SHE GOT ANY CLOSER SHE WOULD BE TOUCHING IT. AT HER FEET LAID A TRUMP PLACARD AN AMERICAN FLAG AND A TAPE RECORDER.

GIALLOMBARDO DESCRIBED HERSELF AS A ??SMALL BUSINESS PERSON? WHO RUNS A MUSIC PUBLISHING COMPANY (SHE DECLINED TO DISCLOSE THE COMPANY??S NAME). SHE SAID SHE??S CONCERNED PRIMARILY WITH THE ECONOMY AND FOREIGN POLICY THOUGH SHE THINKS SOCIAL ISSUES ARE IMPORTANT. BUT MOSTLY SHE SEEMED PREOCCUPIED WITH GETTING AS MUCH OF TRUMP AS SHE POSSIBLY COULD EVEN IF HE WAS TWO-DIMENSIONAL. ??I THINK HE??S THE BEST THING WE??VE GOT TO BASICALLY SAVE THIS COUNTRY FROM FURTHER DEMISE? SHE TOLD ME. ??I SEE MY KIDS?? GENERATION BEING SOLD OUT WITH THIS HUGE NATIONAL DEBT AND HE??S SUCH A GOOD BUSINESSMAN.? I ASKED TO TAKE HER PICTURE. ??LET ME GET MY FLAG!? SHE SAID. SHE HELD UP THE FLAG AND HER TRUMP SIGN WHICH READ ??TRUMP DONALDTRUMPFORVETS.COM? AND SHE SMILED. TRUMP ADVERTISED THE EVENT AS A FUNDRAISER FOR VETERANS BUT AS THE DAILY BEAST REPORTED THURSDAY THE MONEY WILL NOT GO STRAIGHT TO THEM BUT TO THE DONALD J. TRUMP FOUNDATION. IN TOTAL TRUMP CLAIMED IN A PRESS RELEASE TO HAVE RAISED $6 MILLION FOR 22 INDIVIDUAL ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING $1 MILLION HE SAID HE PERSONALLY DONATED. HE DIDN??T DISCLOSE WHERE THE OTHER $5 MILLION CAME FROM. TICKETS TO THE EVENT WERE FREE. AND THE CAMPAIGN DOLED OUT THOUSANDS OF TICKETS TO THE SHOW DESPITE BEING AWARE THAT THEIR VENUE THE UNIVERSITY??S SHESLOW AUDITORIUM COULD HOLD JUST 775 PEOPLE. IT??S A CLASSIC POLITICAL OPTICS TRICK??AN OVERSTUFFED RALLY LOOKS BETTER ON TV THAN ONE WITH EMPTY CHAIRS??BUT SOME PEOPLE WHO STOOD IN LINE FOR HOURS IN THE 32-DEGREE CHILL SEEMED FRUSTRATED. ??HOW WAS YOUR DONALD TRUMP EXPERIENCE?? A FATHER SARCASTICALLY ASKED HIS TEENAGE DAUGHTER AS THEY FILED OUT OF THE AREA AFTER BEING TURNED AWAY.

SHE WAS GOOD BETTER THAN I??D EXPECTED HER TO BE UNDER QUESTIONING THAT YOU WOULDN??T CALL MIKE WALLACE-60 MINUTES TOUGH BUT THAT WAS SOBER AND ON POINT AND THAT CHALLENGED CLINTON ON HER RECENT TROUBLES AND CHARGES AGAINST BERNIE SANDERS. AND IT MADE ME THINK: WHY IN THE WORLD DOESN??T SHE DO THIS MORE OFTEN LIKE VIRTUALLY EVERY DAY JUST LIKE ALL THE OTHER CANDIDATES? ACTUALLY SHE'S STARTING TO. WE??LL GET TO THAT AND THE BROADER CLINTON MEDIA STRATEGY BUT FIRST ABOUT THURSDAY NIGHT. MADDOW SAID TO CLINTON CORRECTLY THAT HER CAMPAIGN ??SET ITS HAIR ON FIRE A LITTLE BIT? THE PREVIOUS AFTERNOON BY HOSTING A MEDIA CONFERENCE CALL TO WAG A BIG FINGER IN BERNIE??S DIRECTION FOR GOING NEGATIVE. NOW MADAM SECRETARY MADDOW REJOINED THAT WASN??T MUCH OF AN ATTACK AD. IT DIDN??T EVEN MENTION YOUR NAME. IT WAS JUST YOUR BASIC COMPARE AND CONTRAST. HERE CLINTON COULD HAVE GOTTEN HERSELF ALL RILED UP AND CONTINUED THE FINGER WAG BUT SHE BACKED AWAY TO SOME DEGREE SAYING THE ISSUE WAS MERELY ONE OF MAKING SANDERS SAY HOW HE WAS GOING TO PAY FOR THINGS. ??I??VE BEEN LAYING OUT MY PLANS I??VE BEEN TELLING YOU WHERE I??M GONNA GET THE MONEY I??VE BEEN TELLING YOU HOW MUCH IT??S GONNA COST? SHE SAID WHEREAS SANDERS HAS NOT SO MUCH ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO HIS MEDICARE FOR ALL OR SINGLE-PAYER HEALTH PLAN. THIS ONE SHOT UP THE CHARTS THIS WEEK AFTER CHELSEA CLINTON CLUMSILY AND UNWISELY ACCUSED SANDERS OF WANTING TO DO AWAY WITH MEDICARE AND MEDICAID AND ??STRIP MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE.? IT WAS FOOLISH AND KIND OF SHOCKING AND SIGNALED PANIC. AND MAYBE THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS PANICKED BUT A CAMPAIGN NEVER WANTS TO SHOW PANIC. IT WAS KIND OF DISASTROUS. QUESTIONED BY MADDOW HILLARY CLINTON WAS ARTFUL AND SPECIFIC (IT STARTS AT ABOUT 11:30 IN THE LINK IN MY FIRST PARAGRAPH). SANDERS SHE SAID HAD PROMISED VOTERS THAT HE??D RELEASE THE DETAILS OF HIS PLAN BEFORE THE IOWA CAUCUSES AND HE HASN??T DONE SO YET AND HE SHOULD SO VOTERS HAVE A WAY OF COMPARING AND CONTRASTING THEIR PLANS. ??IF HE HAS CHANGED HIS MIND ABOUT HAVING THE FED GOVERNMENT PAY 86 PERCENT OF THE COSTS AND HAVING STATES HAVE TO COME UP WITH THE REMAINING 14 PERCENT WHEN IN FACT WE KNOW REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS WON??T EVEN PAY FOR MEDICAID [EXPANSION UNDER OBAMACARE] WHICH THEY??RE GOING TO GET INITIALLY FOR NOTHING WELL THAT??S WHAT WE MEAN? BY RAISING THESE QUESTIONS. I??M NOT GOING TO GET DOWN INTO THE POLICY WEEDS HERE AS IS USUALLY THE CASE THERE??S SOME TRUTH TO WHAT BOTH SIDES ARE SAYING. MY POINT IS THAT CLINTON CAME ACROSS AS CALM AND AUTHORITATIVE WHICH IS LIKE THE MAGIC TV COMBO. SO I WONDERED: WHY DOESN??T SHE DO THIS MORE OFTEN? SHE IS. SHE ALSO DID A CNN SIT-DOWN THIS WEEK AND SHE EVEN CALLED IN DONALD-STYLE TO?ŸMORNING JOE. ODDLY JOE SCARBOROUGH DIDN??T EVEN ASK A QUESTION (SHE ONLY TOOK TWO). AND SHE??S DOING ABC??S?ŸTHIS WEEK?ŸSUNDAY. SHE??S APPARENTLY HITTING SOME OF THE SUNDAY SHOWS THIS WEEKEND. SO THIS IS CHANGING BUT IT??S STILL A CURIOSITY WHEN SHE DOES IT. MIKA BRZEZINSKI INTRODUCED CLINTON BY SAYING WHAT A BIG DEAL THIS WAS WHAT A ??LONG TIME IN COMING? IT WAS. I KNOW WHY CLINTON HASN??T DONE THIS MORE. IT??S BECAUSE UNLIKE MOST OTHER CANDIDATES SHE DOESN??T NEED THE EXPOSURE THE FREE AIR TIME BUT MOSTLY IT??S BECAUSE SHE DOESN??T LIKE IT DOESN??T WANT TO FIELD MORE EMAIL QUESTIONS KNOWS THAT THAT??S WHAT WILL DOMINATE THE COVERAGE. BUT IT PLAYS TO HER STRENGTHS. SHE??S AT HER BEST WHEN SHE??S SITTING SOMEWHERE TALKING CALMLY ABOUT IMPORTANT THINGS. MORE IMPORTANTLY NOT DOING TV IN THIS DAY AND AGE JUST DOESN??T HOLD UP WELL. ALL THESE OTHER CANDIDATES DO IT. THE FRONT-RUNNER ON THE OTHER SIDE DOES IT TO EXCESS CALLING SCARBOROUGH TO REPORT A HANGNAIL. CLINTON NEEDN??T DO THAT BUT WHY NOT GET ON THERE AND MIX IT UP A LITTLE? THE REFUSAL HAS FELT REMOTE AND IMPERIAL. IT FEEDS INTO THAT WHOLE CORONATION PERCEPTION. WHEREAS A CANDIDATE WHO??S OUT THERE SUBMITTING TO QUESTIONS AND DEFENDING HER POLICIES AND STATEMENTS ON THE MEDIUM THAT FOR BETTER OR WORSE SHAPES OUR POLITICAL DISCOURSE AND GOES A LONG WAY TOWARD DEFINING WHAT WE THINK OF THESE PEOPLE IS MORE LIKELY TO BE SEEN AS FIGHTING FOR SOMETHING. IT IS TRUE THAT HER ANSWERS ABOUT EMAILS AND BILL??S WANDERINGS WOULD DOMINATE EVERYTHING??AT FIRST. BUT AFTER ABOUT TWO WEEKS IT WOULD GET OLD. OH HILLARY??S ON TV AGAIN. WHICH WOULD BE A GOOD THING FROM HER PERSPECTIVE. SHE??D BENEFIT FROM GETTING HER HANDS A LITTLE DIRTY IN THE MUD WHERE EVERYBODY ELSE PLAYS. SHE??S DONE MADDOW AND HARDBALL NOW BUT SHE SHOULD HIT CHRIS HAYES (SHE PHONED INTO THAT ONE ONCE) AND LAWRENCE O??DONNELL AND ANDREA MITCHELL TOO AND SHE SHOULD DO THEM MORE THAN ONCE. AND SHE SHOULD DO CNN REGULARLY TOO ALTHOUGH SHE NEEDN??T BOTHER WITH FOX OR MAYBE ONCE OR TWICE. SOME OF THEM WILL LAY A TRAP FOR HER BUT BY THE THIRD OR FOURTH TIME SHE??S ON MORNING JOE OR THE SUNDAY SHOWS IT JUST WON??T BE A BIG DEAL. AND SHE SHOULD KEEP DOING THE ELLEN DEGENERES AND AMANDA DE CADENET THINGS OF COURSE EVEN THOUGH THOSE DON??T HELP MUCH WITH THE POLITICAL CLASS. JIMMY FALLON WHICH SHE DID THE OTHER NIGHT HELPS MORE WITH THAT SET. ON FRIDAY MORNING NATE SILVER STILL HAD HER 82 PERCENT LIKELY TO WIN IOWA AND 57 PERCENT LIKELY TO TAKE NEW HAMPSHIRE BUT SOME POLLS SHOW SHE??S CLEARLY LOST SOME GROUND IN THE LAST MONTH. SO SOMETHING??S NOT WORKING. SHE GETS A LOT OF NEGATIVE PRESS COVERAGE LESS SO SINCE THE EMAIL STORY HAS QUIETED BUT IT STILL AIN??T GREAT WHILE SANDERS GETS ALMOST NOTHING BUT POSITIVE COVERAGE. WE KNOW WHY BOTH OF THOSE THINGS HAPPEN. IT??S BECAUSE THE PRESS DOESN??T LIKE HER. AND SHE DOESN??T LIKE IT. IT??S A COLD WAR AND HAS BEEN FOR 20 YEARS. WELL IT??S NOT SERVING HER WELL AND IT??S PRETTY OBVIOUSLY IN HER INTEREST TO TRY TO END IT. THE WAY TO START IS TO TAKE WOODY ALLEN??S ADVICE ABOUT WHAT CONSTITUTES 90 PERCENT OF LIFE: SHOWING UP. ,9236.0

1453,10460641.0,2016-01-31T18:45:00+00:00,BEING AN IMMIGRANT IS NOW EVEN HARDER,WHEN I CAME TO THE UNITED STATES FROM TURKEY AS AN INTERNATIONAL STUDENT 13 YEARS AGO IT WAS BECAUSE THERE WERE LIMITED EDUCATIONAL AND PROFESSIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN AT HOME. THOUGH I HAD TWO DEGREES THERE WAS NO APPROPRIATE PH.D. PROGRAM FOR ME IN TURKEY. I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO RECEIVE A SCHOLARSHIP THAT COVERED MY TUITION IN A PH.D. PROGRAM AND A SMALL TEACHING ASSISTANT SALARY IN THE U.S. AND I WAS EAGER TO JOIN MY MANY FRIENDS WHO WERE STUDYING ABROAD AND TO GROW FROM THE DIVERSITY AND DIFFERENT CULTURES IN THE STATES. I CANNOT COMPARE MY STATUS THEN WITH THAT OF TODAY??S SYRIAN REFUGEES BUT EVEN UNDER MY DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES THE TRANSITION FROM ONE CULTURE TO ANOTHER WAS HARD AND I DIDN??T ALWAYS FEEL WELCOME. NOT SPEAKING ENGLISH FLUENTLY AND NOT UNDERSTANDING AMERICAN CULTURE WERE THE GREATEST EARLY CHALLENGES I FACED WITH OUTCOMES OCCASIONALLY FUNNY BUT OFTEN DISHEARTENING AND CRUEL. TO EARN MY SCHOLARSHIP I WAS IRONICALLY ASSIGNED TO TEACH PUBLIC SPEAKING WHILE I WAS BARELY ABLE TO CRAFT A SENTENCE IN ENGLISH. I WAS BEYOND EMBARRASSED TO BE IN FRONT OF THE STUDENTS. WHEN I FIRST ARRIVED IN THE UNITED STATES I WAS VERY LONELY AND FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO MAKE CONNECTIONS. ONCE IN A THRIFT STORE WHILE TALKING IN TURKISH WITH A FRIEND WE WERE SCOLDED AND TOLD ??YOU ARE IN THE U.S. SO SPEAK ENGLISH.? I OFTEN WANTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CONVERSATIONS AROUND ME. I WOULD HAVE A GREAT STORY TO TELL ONE THAT COULD MAKE PEOPLE LAUGH BUT I DIDN??T HAVE THE FLUENCY OR VOCABULARY TO TELL IT. I KEPT A LOT IN MY HEART. I CANNOT EVEN IMAGINE THE CHALLENGES OF BEING A SYRIAN REFUGEE WITHOUT THE RESOURCES I HAD TRYING TO ADAPT TO LIVING IN A FOREIGN LAND. ONE BIG CHALLENGE THESE REFUGEES FACE IS THE CURRENT POLITICAL LANDSCAPE IN WHICH AMERICAN POLITICIANS ARE USING A FEAR-BASED RHETORIC THAT SUGGESTS MUSLIM REFUGEES WILL BECOME TERRORISTS OR CRIMINALS OR DEPENDENTS OF THE STATE. NOT ONLY WILL THEY FACE SIMILAR DIFFICULTIES TO MINE AS THEY ASSIMILATE CULTURALLY BUT WILL BE FACED WITH AN IRRATIONAL FEAR AND PRECONCEIVED NOTION UPON ARRIVAL. WHILE IT IS POSSIBLE IN THEORY FROM MY EXPERIENCE IT IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT A TERRORIST DISGUISED AS A SYRIAN REFUGEE WOULD BE LEGALLY ADMITTED TO THE UNITED STATES GIVEN THE COMPREHENSIVE NATURE OF THE CURRENT IMMIGRATION PROCESS. IN ORDER TO BE ADMITTED TO THE UNITED STATES I SUBMITTED A HUGE FOLDER INCLUDING BANK ACCOUNTS REAL ESTATE AND CAR OWNERSHIP TAX RETURNS HEALTH INSURANCE DOCUMENTATION PAY STUBS EMPLOYMENT LETTERS PAY SLIPS ADMISSION LETTERS FROM THE UNIVERSITY WHERE I WAS TO WORK AN I-20 DOCUMENT THAT IS SENT BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT?ŸAIRFARE TICKETS VISA APPLICATION FORMS VISA APPLICATION FEE ETC. THERE WAS A LONG WAIT FOR THE BACKGROUND SEARCH AND ALL APPLICANTS WERE INTERVIEWED BY AN EMBASSY OFFICER WHO COMPARED DATA COLLECTED TO INTERVIEW ANSWERS. THE EXISTING ADMISSION PROCESSES IS SO THOROUGH THAT A SYRIAN WITH A CRIMINAL OR SUSPICIOUS BACKGROUND WOULD HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT TIME BEING GRANTED ADMISSION. DUE TO THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE UNITED STATES IN WARS IN THE MIDDLE EAST THERE IS A LOT OF HATRED AGAINST THE COUNTRY. (A QUICK GOOGLE SEARCH UNCOVERS COUNTLESS ARTICLES ABOUT HATRED AGAINST THE UNITED STATES INCLUDING ??9 COUNTRIES THAT HATE AMERICA MOST? AND EIGHT OF THESE NINE COUNTRIES ARE IN THE MIDDLE EAST). EVEN IN TURKEY WHICH HAS NOT BEEN IN ACTIVE COMBAT WITH THE UNITED STATES THE REVULSION TOWARDS THE NATION IS OBVIOUS IN ISTANBUL AND THE U.S. CONSULATE THERE IS RIGHTLY FEARFUL OF TERRORIST ATTACKS. AFTER THE 2003 ISTANBUL BOMBINGS THE EMBASSY MOVED FROM A CENTRAL LOCATION IN THE CITY TO A SURREAL GIANT CASTLE ON TOP OF A HILL AWAY FROM THE CITY CENTER. ITS FOREIGN POLICY DOES NOT MAKE THE UNITED STATES A HERO IN THE MIDDLE EAST. BUT BY ADMITTING MORE SYRIAN REFUGEES AND OFFERING MORE AID TO THEM THE UNITED STATES CAN BEGIN TO CHANGE ITS ROLE AND REPUTATION NOT ONLY IN THE EYES OF THE MIDDLE EAST BUT IN THE EYES OF THE ENTIRE WORLD. TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN THE SYRIAN WAR AND MILLIONS MORE HAVE FLED THE COUNTRY AS REFUGEES. YET DESPITE U.S. INVOLVEMENT IN THE WAR IT HAS ADMITTED ONLY 1854 SYRIAN REFUGEES SINCE 2012. FOR SYRIANS FINDING A SAFE PLACE TO LIVE IS A MATTER OF LIVING OR DYING. THE UNITED STATES COULD ADMIT MORE REFUGEES AND WELCOME THEM IN WAYS THAT ENABLE THEM TO CREATE ROOTS HERE. OF COURSE NOT ALL AMERICANS ARE TURNING A BLIND EYE TO THE SYRIAN REFUGEE CRISIS. SOME CHOOSE TO CONVEY THE STORIES OF SYRIAN REFUGEES IN CREATIVE WAYS SUCH AS BRANDON STANTON WITH HIS PHOTO WEBSITE HUMANS OF NEW YORK IN ORDER TO CREATE AWARENESS. SOME CHOOSE TO DONATE MONEY. SOME COMMUNITIES CHOOSE TO INVITE AND HOST MORE REFUGEES. BUT WE NEED MORE AMERICANS TO TURN AWAY FROM THEIR ELECTRONIC GADGETS AND ENTERTAINMENT DISTRACTIONS AND STOP BLOCKING OUT THE TRAGEDY. THEY MAY THINK ??IF WE DON??T HEAR IT MAYBE IT DOES NOT EXIST.? BUT IT DOES. WE NEED TO HELP AND WHEN THEY ARRIVE WE NEED TO WELCOME THEM WITH KINDNESS AND COMPASSION.

NOT ONLY DID THE ACTOR STAR IN A DIVISIVE VERSION OF HAMLET THIS PAST YEAR BUT HE ALSO HAD A STARRING ROLE IN BLACK MASS STIRRED CONTROVERSY WITH HIS TRANS CHARACTER IN THE UPCOMING ZOOLANDER 2 AND STARTED FILMING THE TITLE ROLE IN MARVEL??S DOCTOR STRANGE. MEANWHILE MARTIN FREEMAN HAS BEEN NEARLY AS BUSY WRAPPING UP THE HOBBIT SERIES AND HIS ROLE IN FARGO WHILE FILMING NEXT YEAR??S WHISKY TANGO FOXTROT ALONGSIDE TINA FEY AND MAKING AN APPEARANCE IN YET ANOTHER MARVEL PROPERTY CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR.

THAT??S A SEVEN-FOLD INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CASES OF CIVILIAN CASUALTIES IT HAS ACKNOWLEDGED SINCE THE AIRSTRIKE CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE SELF-PROCLAIMED ISLAMIC STATE BEGAN 17 MONTHS AGO. THE 14 NEW INCIDENTS OF CIVILIAN CASUALTIES WHICH SPANNED MOST OF 2015 LED TO AT LEAST 15 DEATHS AND 14 INJURIES A U.S. DEFENSE OFFICIAL TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. BUT WITH THE AMERICAN MILITARY LAUNCHING MORE THAN 7500 AIRSTRIKES OVER THE COURSE OF THE ISIS WAR THE TOLL COULD VERY WELL INCREASE. IN ANY WAR PARTICULARLY ONE IN WHICH THE ONLY CONSISTENT EYES ON THE BATTLEFIELD ARE 30000 FEET IN THE AIR IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY FOR SURE THAT SO MANY STRIKES COULD LEAD TO SO FEW INNOCENT DEATHS. (A RECENT UN REPORT SAID THAT NEARLY 19000 CIVILIANS HAD BEEN KILLED IN THE FIGHTING IN IRAQ ALONE??MOST AT THE HANDS OF THE TERROR ARMY NOT THE COALITION FIGHTING IT.) THE MILITARY PLANS TO RELEASE SUMMARIES OF THESE NEW CASES OF CIVILIAN CASUALTIES IN THREE BATCHES. THE FIRST BATCH WAS RELEASED LAST WEEK WHEN THE U.S. MILITARY ADMITTED THAT IT HAD KILLED EIGHT CIVILIANS AND WOUNDED THREE OTHERS IN FIVE INCIDENTS BETWEEN APRIL 12 AND JULY 4 OF LAST YEAR. ON FRIDAY THE MILITARY WILL ACKNOWLEDGE FIVE MORE INCIDENTS OF KILLING OR WOUNDING INNOCENTS. THE WEEK AFTER THAT IT PLANS TO ANNOUNCE AN ADDITIONAL FOUR CASES THE DAILY BEAST HAS LEARNED. NONE OF THE 14 CASES LED TO THE DEATH OF CHILDREN THE MILITARY CONCLUDED ACCORDING TO DEFENSE OFFICIAL. UP UNTIL LAST WEEK THE U.S. MILITARY HAD ONLY ADMITTED TO KILLING SIX CIVILIANS IN TWO INCIDENTS??ONE IN IRAQ AND ONE IN SYRIA. IN BOTH OF THOSE CASES CHILDREN WERE BELIEVED TO BE AMONG THE DEAD. NONE OF THESE 14 NEW CASES LED TO THE DEATH OF CHILDREN ACCORDING TO THE DEFENSE OFFICIAL. WITH THOSE TWO ADDITIONAL CASES THE U.S. HAS ACKNOWLEDGED KILLING 21 CIVILIANS IN 16 INSTANCES. DURING THAT TIME THE U.S. HAS CONDUCTED 7551 STRIKES IN IRAQ AND SYRIA THE COALITION HAS CONDUCTED 65492 SORTIES ACCORDING DEFENSE DEPARTMENT STATISTICS. AS OF AUGUST 28 THE U.S. MILITARY HAD INVESTIGATED 71 ALLEGATIONS OF CIVILIAN CASUALTIES. THE 14 NEW CASES OF CIVILIAN CASUALTIES FALL INTO TWO CATEGORIES GENERALLY SPEAKING. IN SOME INSTANCES CIVILIANS APPEAR AT A STRIKE SITE MINUTES BEFOREHAND THERE IS NOT ENOUGH TIME TO WAIVE OFF THE ATTACK. IN OTHER CASES THE PILOTS CONDUCTING THE STRIKES REALIZED AFTER THE FACT THAT THE PERSON KILLED WAS NOT A SUSPECTED JIHADIST FIGHTER BUT A CIVILIAN. ??A LOT OF THESE WERE SELF-REPORTED BY OUR FIGHTERS? ONE DEFENSE OFFICIAL EXPLAINED TO THE DAILY BEAST. THE MINIMIZATION OF CIVILIAN CASUALTIES HAS BEEN A KEYSTONE OF THE U.S. EFFORT AGAINST ISIS??AT TIMES TO THE FRUSTRATION OF BOTH MILITARY COMMANDERS AND IRAQI OFFICIALS WHO FEEL THE U.S. IS BEING TOO CAUTIOUS. ??THE COMMANDS AND OTHERS ARE TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT THEY CAN DO. THEY DON??T GET ANY GUIDANCE. THEY ARE TOLD WHAT THEY CAN??T DO? ONE OFFICIAL FAMILIAR WITH THE STRIKE APPROVAL PROCESS AT U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND EXPLAINED TO THE DAILY BEAST. BUT DESPITE ALL THE CLAIMS OF CAUTION THERE IS NO WAY TO INDEPENDENTLY ASSESS THE U.S. MILITARY??S CONTENTION THAT ONLY A HANDFUL OF INNOCENTS HAVE BEEN KILLED BY THE AMERICAN ATTACKS. THE WAR IS TOO DANGEROUS FOR MOST INDEPENDENT OBSERVERS. AND WITH SO FEW U.S. TROOPS ON THE GROUND IN SYRIA THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH TO GO TO A STRIKE SITE AFTERWARDS AND ASSESS THE EFFECTS. DURING THE LAST WAR IN IRAQ FOR EXAMPLE THE U.S. COULD SEND GROUND TROOPS TO ASSESS THE DAMAGE FROM AIRSTRIKES. MOREOVER THERE IS LITTLE PRESSURE FROM CAPITOL HILL FOR THE U.S. MILITARY TO EXPLAIN HOW IT ASSESSES CIVILIAN DEATHS BY AMERICAN AIRSTRIKES OR WHAT IT IS DOING TO PREVENT THEM. RATHER SUCH DETERMINATIONS ARE LEFT TO THE COMMANDERS AND THE MILITARY LAWYERS SIGNING OFF ON STRIKES. ??U.S. AND COALITION FORCES WORK DILIGENTLY TO BE PRECISE IN OUR AIRSTRIKES. WE TAKE GREAT CARE FROM ANALYSIS OF AVAILABLE INTELLIGENCE TO SELECTION OF THE APPROPRIATE WEAPON TO MEET MISSION REQUIREMENTS TO MINIMIZE THE RISK OF COLLATERAL DAMAGE PARTICULARLY ANY POTENTIAL HARM TO CIVILIANS? SAID AIR FORCE COL. PATRICK RYDER A U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND SPOKESMAN IN A STATEMENT TO THE DAILY BEAST. ??WE TAKE ALL ALLEGATIONS OF CIVILIAN CASUALTIES SERIOUSLY AND ASSESS ALL INCIDENTS AS THOROUGHLY AS POSSIBLE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR COMMITMENT TO TRANSPARENCY WE ARE WORKING TO RELEASE ASSESSMENT FINDINGS OF CLOSED ALLEGATIONS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.? BUT AT TIMES ??AS SOON AS POSSIBLE? HASN??T BEEN ALL THAT SOON. FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS THE U.S. REFUSED TO ADMIT THAT IT HAD KILLED A SINGLE CIVILIAN IN THE ISIS WAR. AND THE SURGE IN ANNOUNCEMENTS NOW HAPPENED ONLY AFTER AN INTENSE STRUGGLE WITHIN THE NATIONAL SECURITY ESTABLISHMENT. IN SOME CASES THE U.S. MILITARY REACHED ITS CONCLUSIONS ABOUT CIVILIAN CASUALTIES MONTHS AGO BUT OFFICIALS COULD NOT AGREE ON WHEN TO RELEASE ITS FINDINGS. OUTGOING U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND CHIEF GEN. LLOYD AUSTIN WAS KEEN TO RELEASE THE FINDINGS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TWO DEFENSE OFFICIALS SAID. BUT AUSTIN RAN INTO BUREAUCRATIC RESISTANCE. AND SO DEATHS AND INJURIES CAUSED MONTHS AGO ARE ONLY BEING ACKNOWLEDGED NOW. ,7527.0

IT??S A SENTIMENT ECHOED REPEATEDLY ON HER FACEBOOK PAGE WHERE SHE REPORTS SIMILAR CASES OF WATER CONTAMINATION DAILY.

IN RESPONSE BROCKOVICH CALLS OUT BIG BUSINESSES AND ATTACKS CITY COUNCILS WITH A TENACITY THAT LEADS HER HALF-A-MILLION FOLLOWERS TO DECLARE HER A ??HERO.? BROCKOVICH??S LATEST CAUSE ONE THAT SHE SAYS IS ON THE ??FAST TRACK TO BECOMING THE NEXT FLINT? IS IN THE CITY OF STOCKTON CALIFORNIA. ??CONGRATULATIONS? SHE WRITES TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. ??YOU'RE ADDING AMMONIA TO YOUR DRINKING WATER BECAUSE YOU'RE TOO LAZY AND CHEAP TO REMOVE DIRT (ORGANICS) FROM YOUR WATER SUPPLIES...? IT??S ONE OF MANY CASES THAT BROCKOVICH IS FIGHTING FOR??SCENES THAT SHE??S SEEN TOO MANY TIMES.

1391,10430390.0,2016-01-30T05:00:00+00:00,THE UNBELIEVABLY RACIST WORLD OF CLASSIC CHILDREN??S LITERATURE,WHEN I READ ABOUT THE CONTROVERSY SWIRLING AROUND THE CHILDREN??S BOOK A BIRTHDAY CAKE FOR GEORGE WASHINGTON I GAVE A LITTLE SHUDDER AND THOUGHT THERE BUT FOR THE VAGARIES OF FORTUNE GO I. YEARS AGO I COLLABORATED ON A CHILDREN??S BOOK CALLED JUMP! THE ADVENTURES OF BRER RABBIT. THE BOOK WAS A RETELLING OF SEVERAL AFRICAN AMERICAN FOLK TALES FIRST COLLECTED BY JOEL CHANDLER HARRIS IN THE LATE 19TH CENTURY AND PUBLISHED IN A SERIES OF BOOKS THAT ALL FEATURED UNCLE REMUS A FICTIONAL FORMER SLAVE AS THE STORYTELLER. MY CO-AUTHOR VAN DYKE PARKS AND I AGREED EARLY IN THE PROCESS TO DO THREE THINGS. FIRST GET RID OF THE DIALECT USED TO TELL THE STORIES IN THE CHANDLER BOOKS. SECOND GET RID OF UNCLE REMUS. THIRD STAY FAR FAR AWAY FROM THE TAR BABY STORY. THE BOOK GOT GOOD REVIEWS AND SOLD WELL ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY TWO SEQUELS. IF THERE WAS ANY PROTEST IT NEVER GOT BACK TO ME. STILL I ALWAYS FELT LIKE WE??D GOTTEN AWAY WITH SOMETHING EVEN IF I WASN??T SURE WHAT. BECAUSE WHEN YOU TAKE A STROLL THROUGH THE TERRITORY OF CHILDREN??S LITERATURE YOU??D BETTER KNOW WHERE THE LAND MINES ARE BURIED. THE FOLKS AT SCHOLASTIC BOOKS WERE SWIFTLY REMINDED OF THIS??TWICE!??IN THE LAST FEW DAYS. FOR DECADES SCHOLASTIC HAS BEEN ONE OF THE BIGGEST MOST EXPERIENCED PUBLISHERS OF BOOKS FOR YOUNG READERS ON THE PLANET (HARRY POTTER IS JUST THE TIP OF THEIR ICEBERG). BUT CLEARLY WHEN THEY PUBLISHED A BIRTHDAY CAKE FOR GEORGE WASHINGTON ON JANUARY 5 THEY HAD NO IDEA OF THE RUCKUS THEY WERE KICKING UP. WRITTEN BY RAMIN GANESHRAM AND ILLUSTRATED BY VANESSA BRANTLEY-NEWTON THE BOOK TELLS THE STORY BASED IN FACT OF HERCULES GEORGE WASHINGTON??S JOLLY COOK WHO IS BAKING A CAKE FOR HIS MASTER AND RUNS OUT OF SUGAR. THE PROBLEM SAID CRITICS INCLUDING THE RESPECTED SCHOOL LIBRARY JOURNAL AND KIRKUS REVIEWS WAS THAT WHILE THE STORY NOTES THAT HERCULES WAS A SLAVE IT GLOSSED OVER THE PLIGHT OF AFRICAN AMERICANS IN BONDAGE. KIRKUS CALLED IT ??AN INCOMPLETE EVEN DISHONEST TREATMENT OF SLAVERY.? THE PROTESTS WERE SUCCESSFUL. SCHOLASTIC BOWED TO THE PRESSURE AND PULLED THE BOOK FROM STORES ON JANUARY 17. THAT IN TURN SET OFF ANOTHER ROUND OF PROTESTS THIS TIME FROM CIVIL LIBERTIES CHAMPIONS SUCH AS THE NATIONAL COALITION AGAINST CENSORSHIP PEN AMERICAN CENTER AND THE FIRST AMENDMENT COMMITTEE OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF JOURNALISTS AND AUTHORS WHO ARGUED THAT ??WHILE IT IS PERFECTLY VALID FOR CRITICS TO DISPUTE A BOOK??S HISTORICAL ACCURACY AND LITERARY MERITS THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE IS NOT TO WITHDRAW THE VOLUME AND DEPRIVE READERS OF A CHANCE TO EVALUATE THE BOOK AND THE CONTROVERSY FOR THEMSELVES.? ?Ÿ NOR IS A BIRTHDAY CAKE FOR GEORGE WASHINGTON THE ONLY OFFENDER. LAST YEAR SAW THE PUBLICATION OF A FINE DESSERT ABOUT A SLAVE MOTHER AND HER DAUGHTER MAKING A DESSERT CALLED BLACKBERRY FOOL. WRITTEN BY EMILY JENKINS AND ILLUSTRATED BY CALDECOTT WINNER SOPHIE BLACKALL THAT BOOK TOO WAS CRITICIZED FOR ELIDING THE HORRORS OF SLAVERY. THE IRONY HERE IS TWOFOLD. FIRST THE WORLD OF CHILDREN??S BOOK PUBLISHING IS ACHINGLY FORWARD THINKING AND POLITICALLY CORRECT. THIS IS DUE IN NO SMALL PART TO THE PEDAGOGICAL IMPULSE AMONG PUBLISHERS OF BOOKS FOR CHILDREN AND THE BOOKS THAT RESULT ARE TOO OFTEN DREARILY AND RELENTLESSLY ON THE SIDE OF THE ANGELS. FOR EVERY STINKY CHEESE MAN OR CAPTAIN UNDERPANTS THERE ARE FIVE PICTURE BOOKS DEALING WITH LGBT ISSUES IMMIGRANT SAGAS RACISM OR EVEN THE HOLOCAUST. YES THERE ARE PICTURE BOOKS ABOUT CONCENTRATION CAMPS FOR CHILDREN NOT EVEN OLD ENOUGH TO READ. SECOND CHILDREN??S BOOK PUBLISHING IS HISTORICALLY RIFE WITH EXAMPLES OF RACISM AND PREJUDICE. WHILE THIS IRONY MIGHT SEEM AT FIRST TO CONTRADICT THE FIRST ONE IT ACTUALLY HELPS EXPLAIN IT: OVER THE PAST HALF CENTURY OR SO CHILDREN??S BOOK PUBLISHERS HAVE LABORED MIGHTILY NOT TO REPEAT THE MISTAKES OF THEIR PREDECESSORS. THEY WILL BE INCLUSIVE. THEY WILL BE VIGILANT IN ROOTING OUT CASUAL OR UNTHINKING PREJUDICED WAYS OF THINKING. THIS IS KID LIT IN FULL INSTRUCTIONAL MODE. IT??S EASY TO SEE HOW THEY GOT TO THAT POINT BECAUSE THE TROUBLESOME THING ABOUT BOOKS IS THAT THEY NEVER COMPLETELY GO AWAY. AND A LOT OF THE BOOKS WITH OFFENSIVE MATERIAL ARE IN FACT CLASSICS SO THE WHOLE INDUSTRY IS SADDLED WITH AN UGLY PAST THAT KEEPS BREAKING IN ON THE PRESENT. IN THE WAKE OF THE CONTROVERSY OVER A BIRTHDAY CAKE FOR GEORGE WASHINGTON THE INTERNET LIT UP WITH STORIES GLEEFULLY LISTING CLASSIC WORKS OF CHILDREN??S LITERATURE THAT CONTAIN OFFENSIVE PASSAGES. THERE ARE EARLY 20TH CENTURY COUNTING BOOKS (YES MORE THAN ONE) CALLED TEN LITTLE N**GERS (ALSO THE ORIGINAL TITLE OF AGATHA CHRISTIE??S TEN LITTLE INDIANS). IN ONE EPISODE IN THE STORY OF DR. DOLITTLE A BLACK MAN WANTS TO MARRY A WHITE PRINCESS SO THE GOOD DOCTOR DEVISES A WAY TO BLEACH THE MAN WHITE. PETER PAN AND THE LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE BOOKS DEMEAN NATIVE AMERICANS. TINTIN IN THE CONGO DEPICTS AFRICANS AS STUPID GROTESQUES WHO WORSHIP WHITE PEOPLE. IN THE SECRET GARDEN THE PROTAGONIST MARY SAYS THAT ??BLACKS ARE NOT PEOPLE? AND NO ONE EVER CONTRADICTS HER ALTHOUGH THE BOOK IS OTHERWISE DEDICATED TO CORRECTING HER BEHAVIOR AT EVERY TURN. IN EARLY EDITIONS OF CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY THE OOMPA LOOMPAS WERE BLACK CANNIBALS. AND MANY READERS OBJECT TO THE ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN BECAUSE MARK TWAIN (IN THIS REGARD AT LEAST THE QUENTIN TARANTINO OF HIS TIME) USES THE WORD N**GER MORE THAN 200 TIMES. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF TWAIN WHO KNEW PRECISELY WHAT HE WAS DOING THE AUTHORS IN QUESTION WERE ALMOST SURELY CLUELESS ABOUT THEIR CASUAL OR UNTHINKING RACISM. THEY WERE THE FECKLESS PRISONERS OF THEIR TIMES AND MUCH AS WE??D LIKE FOR PEOPLE IN THE PAST TO SHARE OUR ENLIGHTENMENT ESPECIALLY PEOPLE WE OTHERWISE ADMIRE IT??S JUST NOT GOING TO HAPPEN IN AN UNFORTUNATE NUMBER OF CASES. AND A COUPLE OF CENTURIES FROM NOW WHEN PEOPLE LOOK BACK AT US THEY TOO SURELY WILL BE THINKING HOW COULD THEY? THE CASE OF JOEL CHANDLER HARRIS IS PARTICULARLY RELEVANT IN THIS REGARD. A LIFELONG SOUTHERNER AND AN ATLANTA NEWSPAPER EDITOR (AND INCIDENTALLY A FRIEND OF TWAIN??S) HARRIS WAS PROBABLY AS ENLIGHTENED AS A WHITE PERSON COULD BE IN HIS TIME AND PLACE. IF YOU READ HIS UNCLE REMUS STORIES YOU??LL SEE THAT TO HARRIS UNCLE REMUS WAS A HERO. HE??S CERTAINLY THE SMARTEST AND KINDEST PERSON BLACK OR WHITE IN THE NARRATIVE THAT FRAMES THE FOLK TALES COLLECTED BY THE AUTHOR FROM FORMER SLAVES. MORE IMPORTANT HAD HARRIS NOT COLLECTED THOSE FOLKTALES WE ALMOST SURELY WOULD HAVE MISSED MUCH OF A VAST TROVE OF ORAL STORYTELLING (??OUR MOST PRECIOUS PIECE OF STOLEN GOODS? TWAIN CALLED THEM??SO THAT??S WHAT WE WERE GETTING AWAY WITH!) BECAUSE BEFORE HARRIS NO ONE ELSE HAD THE SENSE TO REALIZE HOW WONDERFUL THOSE STORIES WERE MUCH LESS THAT THEY SHOULD BE RECORDED FOR POSTERITY. WHATEVER SINS HE MAY HAVE BEEN GUILTY OF HARRIS KNEW AT LEAST THAT MUCH. JAMES WELDON JOHNSON CALLED THE 185 STORIES PUBLISHED BY HARRIS ??THE GREATEST BODY OF FOLKLORE AMERICA HAS PRODUCED.? (I??M COMPLETELY IGNORING THE TANGLED HISTORY OF DISNEY??S SONG OF THE SOUTH THE ANIMATED AND LIVE ACTION FILM BASED ON HARRIS??S STORIES SINCE NONE OF THAT CAN BE BLAMED ON HARRIS. I WILL ONLY SAY THAT THE RACISM AND PREJUDICE EMBEDDED IN A HOST OF DISNEY PROJECTS MERITS SEVERAL DISSERTATIONS.) THE POINT WITH HARRIS AND NEARLY ALL THE OTHER SO-CALLED RACIST WRITERS OF CLASSIC CHILDREN??S BOOKS IS THAT THEY WEREN??T HATERS. RACISM WASN??T ON THEIR AGENDA THE WAY IT WAS WITH SAY D.W. GRIFFITH OR LENI RIEFENSTAHL. TRY WATCHING THE BIRTH OF A NATION OR THE TRIUMPH OF THE WILL AND YOU??VE GOT A REAL PROBLEM TO SORT: HERE ARE FILMS OF GENIUS WITH DESPICABLE MESSAGES AT THE VERY HEART OF THE STORIES THEY TELL. BUT WITH MOST OF THE CLASSIC CHILDREN??S BOOKS TAGGED AS RACIST THE PREJUDICE CROPS UP MORE AS A REFLECTION OF THE TIMES IN WHICH THE BOOKS WERE WRITTEN. PEOPLE ON THE FRONTIER PRAIRIE DID DEMONIZE NATIVE AMERICANS AND THEY DID GO TO MINSTREL SHOWS JUST THE WAY LAURA INGALLS WILDER DESCRIBES THEM IN THE LITTLE HOUSE BOOKS. TO PRETEND OTHERWISE DOES A DISSERVICE TO HISTORY. OR TRY THIS: EXCISE OR MERELY SKIP THE OFFENSIVE PASSAGES IN PROBLEMATICAL CLASSICS AND SEE HOW MUCH DAMAGE YOU DO. TAKE AWAY THE DIALECT AND THE CHARACTER OF UNCLE REMUS AND THE TRICKSTER TALES HE COLLECTED ARE IN NO WAY DIMINISHED. REJIGGER THE TEXT AND REDRAW A FEW ILLUSTRATIONS FOR CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY AND THE OOMPA LOOMPAS ARE WELL JUST OOMPA LOOMPAS. THIS DOESN??T ALWAYS WORK OF COURSE. TINTIN IN THE CONGO TO CITE BUT ONE EXAMPLE IS APPALLING NO MATTER HOW YOU LOOK AT IT. THE DILEMMA OF RACISM AND PREJUDICED LANGUAGE SOILING CERTAIN WORKS OF CHILDREN??S LITERATURE IS REAL ENOUGH. HOWEVER OBSESSING OVER RACIST PASSAGES IN OTHERWISE BELOVED BOOKS IGNORES A FAR MORE PERNICIOUS PROBLEM: UNTIL ROUGHLY THE LAST HALF CENTURY CHILDREN??S LITERATURE WAS OVERWHELMINGLY UNRELENTINGLY WHITE. THE AUTHORS WERE WHITE AND SO WERE THE CHARACTERS IN THEIR STORIES. IMAGINE THE DAMAGE IT DOES TO A CHILD WHO ISN??T WHITE TO GROW UP READING BOOKS WHERE HE OR SHE CAN??T IDENTIFY WITH ANYONE IN THE STORIES. SURELY THIS CORRODES A CHILD??S SENSE OF SELF IN FAR MORE LASTING AND INSIDIOUS WAYS. TO BE SURE CHILDREN??S BOOK PUBLISHERS HAVE LABORED MIGHTILY??AND YES SOMETIMES WEARISOMELY??TO REDRESS THIS INSULT IN RECENT DECADES. BOOKS FOR CHILDREN FEATURING PEOPLE OF COLOR AND VARIED ETHNICITIES NOW ABOUND AND IF THEY DO NOT REDRESS THE DAMAGE DONE BY ANGLO-CENTRIC BOOKS OF THE PAST IT??S NOT FOR WANT OF TRYING. ?ŸMAINTAINING THAT PROGRESSIVE SPIRIT DESERVES OUR ENERGY FAR MORE THAN ANY EFFORT TO CONDEMN OR BANISH OLD BOOKS UNFORTUNATELY TAINTED BY THE MORES OF THE PAST. OF COURSE PARENTS TEACHERS AND LIBRARIANS??ANYONE WHO PUTS BOOKS IN THE HANDS OF CHILDREN??SHOULD KNOW WHAT??S IN THOSE BOOKS AND BE PREPARED TO DISCUSS WITH YOUNG READERS WHERE THOSE BOOKS GO ASTRAY. THE FIRST LESSON THEY COULD TEACH WOULD BE THAT WE LIVE IN A MORE ENLIGHTENED TIME THAN THE TIMES THAT PRODUCED THOSE CLASSICS. IT DOESN??T MEAN WE??RE BETTER PEOPLE BUT IT DOES MEAN WE??RE LUCKIER. ,12289.0

ACCORDING TO ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT 126 DIAMONDS WERE USED JUST TO ENCRUST THE PANTIES. WHO WOULDN??T WANT TO HAVE A CARRIE BRADSHAW MOMENT OR A HUNDRED OF THEM? PICK UP 100 PAIRS OF THE ??NEW VERY RICHE? CRYSTAL-ENCRUSTED LOUBOUTIN PUMPS AT $4995. THEY??LL GO PERFECTLY WITH THE VICTORIA??S SECRET FANTASY SET.

ACCORDING TO DIGITAL TRENDS THE SWEDISH-MADE CAR ??IS LITERALLY COATED IN DIAMONDS? SO IT??S NO WONDER IT COSTS $4.8 MILLION. BUYING FOUR WILL SET YOU BACK ABOUT $20 MILLION.

THAT MAY SOUND STEEP BUT THE PENTHOUSE COMES WITH A WHISKEY BAR BILLIARDS ROOM FOUR KITCHENS AND ITS OWN NIGHTCLUB WITH A MARBLE DANCE FLOOR. WHEN YOU THINK OF THOSE THINGS IT??S ALMOST A STEAL. IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING YOU??LL NEED AN ABODE IN NEW YORK CITY EVEN IF IT??S A RELATIVE PIED-?Ÿ-TERRE COMPARED TO THE ODEON TOWER. MIGHT WE SUGGEST A UNIT IN MANHATTAN??S UBER-TRENDY TRIBECA AT 443 GREENWICH STREET A RESTORED HISTORIC BUILDING EQUIPPED WITH A TEMPERATURE-CONTROLLED WINE CELLAR AND TURKISH BATHS ACCORDING TO THE STREETEASY LISTING.

1104,10243176.0,2016-01-24T23:36:00+00:00,INSIDE BARACK AND MICHELLE OBAMA??S STEAMY FIRST DATE,THE ADORABLE TALE OF HOW BARACK AND MICHELLE OBAMA FELL IN LOVE OVER A SPIKE LEE MOVIE AND ICE CREAM IS ALREADY THE STUFF OF WHITE HOUSE LEGEND BUT AT SUNDANCE AUDIENCES GOT A GLIMPSE OF A YOUNGER SEXIER F-BOMB DROPPING VERSION OF THE 44TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. BARACK AND MICHELLE??S BEFORE SUNRISE-ESQUE FIRST DATE MAKES FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THE CHARMING INDIE ROMANCE SOUTHSIDE WITH YOU THE CROWD-PLEASING UNOFFICIAL VERSION OF HOW AMERICA??S FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT??S CAMELOT UNFOLDED IN CHICAGO IN THE SUMMER OF 1989 WHEN ONE EPIC DATE BROUGHT THE FUTURE POTUS AND FLOTUS TOGETHER. WE FIRST MEET MICHELLE ROBINSON (PRODUCER-STAR TIKA SUMPTER) IN A WHITE PENCIL SKIRT AND BRA AS SHE GETS DRESSED FOR WHAT SHE SWEARS TO HER DOTING PARENTS IS ABSOLUTELY DEFINITELY NOT A DATE WITH THE HANDSOME YOUNG SUMMER ASSOCIATE WHO??S HER JUNIOR AT WORK. ??YOU SAID HE WAS ANOTHER SMOOTH-TALKING BROTHER? HER MOTHER TEASES. ??BARACK O-WHAT?? HER FATHER SHOUTS. MEANWHILE BARACK (BREAKOUT NEWCOMER PARKER SAWYERS) GETS THE SWAGGIEST SCREEN INTRO THE WHITE HOUSE BIOPIC GENRE IS LIKELY TO EVER SEE. NONCHALANTLY RECLINING IN A TANK TOP IN THE SUMMER HEAT HE LIGHTS UP A CIGARETTE LIKE A YOUNG BRANDO. HIS BACHELOR PAD IS A MESS THE SINK FILLED WITH DIRTY DISHES BUT BARACK WOULD RATHER PREPARE FOR HIS BIG DATE BY READING A BOOK. DIRECTOR RICHARD TANNE SETS A PLAYFUL TONE FOR THE OPPOSITES ATTRACT DYNAMIC BETWEEN THE COUPLE. HOPPING IN HIS BEAT-UP CAR THE FUTURE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES DRIVES THROUGH THE STREETS OF CHICAGO??S SOUTH SIDE BUMPING JANET JACKSON??S ??MISS YOU MUCH? TAPPING HIS FINGERS ALONG TO THE BEAT AS THE OPENING TITLES SPLASH ONSCREEN IN A PINK SCRAWL. SHE??S RELUCTANT TO DATE HIM AWARE THAT BEING ROMANTICALLY LINKED TO AN UNDERLING AT WORK WILL ONLY MAKE HER ACHIEVEMENTS AS A BLACK WOMAN HARDER. BUT HE??S CHARMING PERSISTENT AND CUTE. THEY BICKER AND BANTER AND OVER THE COURSE OF THE AFTERNOON THEIR MEANDERING NON-DATE-DATE TAKES THEM FROM AN EXHIBIT OF AFROCENTRIC PAINTINGS TO SANDWICHES IN THE PARK TO A CHURCH MEETING OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZERS WHERE MICHELLE IS DAZZLED BY BARACK ABILITY TO INSPIRE. HEARING AN AD FOR SPIKE LEE??S DO THE RIGHT THING ON THE RADIO ?? ??THEY SAY IT??S RACIST AGAINST WHITE PEOPLE? A CURIOUS OBAMA NOTES??THEY EVENTUALLY END UP AT THE MOVIES WHERE A CHANCE ENCOUNTER WITH A WHITE PARTNER AT THEIR FIRM UNDERSCORES THE COMPLEXITIES OF BEING BLACK AND AMBITIOUS IN A PREDOMINANTLY WHITE WORLD. SOUTHSIDE WITH YOU LOSES ITS CRACKLING MOMENTUM AT TIMES AS TANNE INJECTS HIS WALKING AND TALKING SCENES WITH IMPORTANT DIALOGUE AND VERGES ON PREACHINESS IN WHAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE A PERFECTLY ADORABLE FIRST-BLUSH ROMANCE. RATHER THAN DIVE INTO PARTISAN COMMENTARY OR BARACK??S POLITICAL BELIEFS IT EMPHASIZES BARACK THE PROMISING FORMER COMMUNITY ORGANIZER HIS LATENT EXCEPTIONALISM FRUSTRATIONS WITH GROWING UP HALF-BLACK AND RESENTMENT FOR THE ABSENT FATHER WHOM HE WOULD LATER PEN A BOOK ABOUT. ??IT??S JUST A LOVE STORY??IT??S NOT REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT? SUMPTER SAID AT SUNDANCE DRAWING CHEERS FROM THE AUDIENCE. AS HOLLYWOOD SCRAMBLES AROUND THE HOT-BUTTON ISSUE OF THIS YEAR??S #WHITEOSCARS THE ACTRESS AND PRODUCER ALSO ILLUMINATED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF A FILM LIKE THIS FEATURING AFRICAN AMERICAN SUBJECTS AND STARS: ??I WANTED TO SEE SOMEBODY WHO LOOKED LIKE ME FALLING IN LOVE UP THERE.? THE CHARACTERS OF SOUTHSIDE WITH YOU AND THE FILMMAKERS NAVIGATE AND DISCUSS RACE IN AMERICA NOT JUST IN MACRO TERMS BUT ALSO IN PERSONAL TERMS AS THE FILM EMPHASIZES OBAMA??S MULTICULTURAL ORIGINS AND HIS HISTORY OF DATING WHITE WOMEN. ??HER SKIN IS OF THE DARKER PERSUASION? HE ASSURES HIS GRANDMOTHER OVER THE PHONE. LATER OVER BEERS WITH MICHELLE HE EXPLAINS THAT A TWO-YEAR RELATIONSHIP WITH A WHITE GIRLFRIEND MADE HIM REALIZE HE DIDN??T WANT TO FEEL LIKE AN ??OUTSIDER.? THE REAL OBAMAS WERE REPORTEDLY FLABBERGASTED TO LEARN THAT ANYONE WOULD WANT TO MAKE A MOVIE ABOUT THEIR EPIC FIRST DATE. DIRECTOR TANNE ADMITTED THAT THE FILM IS ONLY ??90 PERCENT? ACCURATE CULLED FROM PUBLIC RECORDS AND INTERVIEWS THE FIRST COUPLE HAVE GIVEN DETAILING THE BEGINNINGS OF THEIR ROMANCE. THE CROWD AT THE FILM??S SUNDANCE PREMIERE WENT NUTS FOR THE FILM AND ITS WINNING LEADS CAPTIVATED IN PARTICULAR BY OBAMA LOOKALIKE PARKER SAWYERS. SOME HOWEVER QUESTIONED WHETHER NOT KNOWING EXACTLY HOW THE FIRST DATE WENT DOWN DIMINISHED ITS IMPACT. THAT ARTISTIC LICENSE HOWEVER LENDS SOUTHSIDE WITH YOU THE FREEDOM TO WEAVE IN BIGGER THEMES OF RACE CLASS AND HOW INDIVIDUALS CAN EFFECT CHANGE IN AMERICA. IT ALSO ALLOWS TANNE TO DEPICT A RARELY SEEN SENSUAL SIDE OF PRESIDENT OBAMA: CONFIDENT RELAXED RELENTLESSLY FLIRTY AND GIVEN TO SHOOTING HUNGRY GLANCES AT HIS FUTURE WIFE. HISTORY OFFICIALLY KNOWS THEIR FIRST DATE ENDED OVER ICE CREAM WHICH HERE ACTS AS A CONCILIATORY PEACE OFFERING THAT ENDS MICHELLE AND BARACK??S FIRST LOVERS?? QUARREL. THAT INFAMOUS ICE CREAM CONE??CHOCOLATE MICHELLE??S FAVORITE??ALSO LEADS TO A TRUE SUNDANCE SURPRISE: A FIRST KISS SO HOT IT MADE THEATERGOERS AT SUNDANCE MELT IN THE AISLES.?Ÿ ,29020.0
373,9770368.0,2016-01-09T05:08:00+00:00,GOLDEN GLOBES FORECAST: WHY AMY SCHUMER SHOULD BEAT OUT BFF JENNIFER LAWRENCE AND MORE ,MARLOW: THE GOLDEN GLOBES IS SUNDAY AND YES THEY??RE NOW THANKS TO YEARS OF GREAT HOSTING REGARDED AS MORE THAN THE OSCARS?? DRUNK CORRUPT COUSIN. WHILE THERE ARE STILL NO BLACK VOTERS ACTUALLY VOTING ON THE AWARDS??WHICH DON??T GET ME WRONG IS A MAJOR PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED??THE DAYS OF MOVIES LIKE THE SILLY BURLESQUE BEING AWARDED MULTIPLE NOMS FOLLOWING A FLASHY VEGAS TRIP (REPLETE WITH CHER CONCERT) FOR HOLLYWOOD FOREIGN PRESS VOTERS OR THE TOURIST TO GET JOHNNY AND ANGELINA TO ATTEND THE SOIREE SEEM LIKE A DISTANT MEMORY. KEVIN: DISTANT MEMORY? #NEVERFORGET BURLESQUE. MARLOW: R.I.P. CHRISTINA AGUILERA??S MOVIE CAREER. OK SO LET??S START WITH THE MOVIES. FOR BEST MOTION PICTURE ?? DRAMA MY CHOICE HAS TO BE MAD MAX: FURY ROAD WHICH WAS UNFAIRLY SHUNNED BY THE BAFTAS. IT WAS IN MY HUMBLE OPINION THE MOST THRILLING CHILDLIKE WONDERMENT-INDUCING MOVIE OF THE YEAR. CAROL WAS ABSOLUTELY LOVELY IMMACULATELY STAGED AND HAD ARGUABLY THE BEST FINAL SCENE (ALONG WITH PHOENIX) OF 2015 BUT I GOTTA GIVE IT TO MY GIRL FURIOSA THE MOST BADASS CINEMA HEROINE SINCE ELLEN RIPLEY. THAT BEING SAID BEST ACTRESS IN A MOTION PICTURE ?? DRAMA SHOULD GO TO THE INIMITABLE CATE BLANCHETT FOR HER OUTR?? TURN AS A CLOSETED 1950S HOUSEWIFE IN TODD HAYNES??S CAROL. BLANCHETT REMAINS ONE OF THE FEW ACTRESSES IN HOLLYWOOD ALONG WITH MARION COTILLARD NAOMI WATTS JESSICA CHASTAIN AND THE NEWLY-MINTED REBECCA FERGUSON WHO EXUDES CLASSIC MOVIE STAR GLAMOUR AND HERE SHE IS AN ABSOLUTE DYNAMO CONVEYING CAROL??S INNER ANGUISH AND TORMENT AT THE HANDS OF AN INIQUITOUS SOCIETY. SINCE MY TWO FAVORITE LEAD ACTRESS PERFORMANCES OF THE YEAR WERE SNUBBED (CHARLIZE IN MAD MAX AND NINA HOSS IN PHOENIX) CATE GETS THE GOLD. KEVIN: I LOVE THE GOLDEN GLOBES. I THINK IT??S HILARIOUS WHEN THEY DO THINGS LIKE NOMINATE BURLESQUE?ŸFOR BEST PICTURE AND I THINK IT??S AN ESSENTIAL CORRECTIVE TO THE OSCARS DISTASTE FOR GENRE FARE WHEN COMEDIES LIKE BRIDESMAIDS GHOSTBUSTERS HOME ALONE AND THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL-TIME SISTER ACT?ŸCAN BE CONSIDERED BEST PICTURE NOMINEES AS WELL AS MORE ACTION-HEAVY MOVIES LIKE MY PICK FOR BEST DRAMA THIS YEAR MAD MAX: FURY ROAD. MARLOW: I ENJOY THE BATSHIT ASPECT OF IT TOO??ALONG WITH THE 7500 BOTTLES OF CHAMPAGNE THE STARS ARE GETTING SLOSHED ON WHICH MAKES IT SORT OF LIKE THE BACHELOR/BACHELORETTE MEETS A BLACK TIE CEREMONY. AND DON??T FORGET SISTER ACT II FOR THE LAURYN HILL FACTOR! BUT YES THE OSCARS?? DISTASTE FOR ALL THINGS COMEDY CONTINUES TO BE AN EMBARRASSMENT AGREED. ANYWAYS?? KEVIN: SADLY I THINK FOR THE MOST BADASS FEMINIST DYSTOPIAN CAR CHASE CONSERVATION FLICK OF ALL TIME IT??S TRULY JUST AN HONOR TO BE NOMINATED. I PREDICT THAT CAROL?ŸWILL WIN BEST DRAMA EVEN THOUGH FOR ALL ITS PRETTY COSTUMES AND ACHING ROMANCE IT??S FAR TOO STILL FOR MY TASTE AND NEVER REALLY CONVINCES ME THAT THERE??S A GOOD REASON FOR ROONEY MARA??S THERESE SO BE SO OBSESSED WITH THIS TITULAR BASKET CASE...LET ALONE WHY ME AS A VIEWER SHOULD CARE ABOUT HER. SOLID REVIEWS FOR THE FILM AND FOR BLANCHETT WHO I THINK IS OUT-ACTED BY MARA WILL CARRY BOTH TO A WIN. WHICH IS A MAJOR BUMMER BECAUSE BRIE LARSON IS SO MUCH MORE DESERVING FOR HER STARTLING STAR-IS-BORN TURN IN ROOM.?Ÿ IS THERE EVEN A POINT TALKING ABOUT BEST ACTOR IN A DRAMA? LEO GETS RAPED BY A BEAR WINS AWARD...RIGHT??Ÿ MARLOW: BRIE IS EXCELLENT IN ROOM THOUGH I THOUGHT SHE TURNED IN A SUPERIOR (AND CRIMINALLY OVERLOOKED) PERFORMANCE IN SHORT TERM 12. AS FOR THE BEAR RAPE THAT WASN??T YES THE HFPA LOVES LEO. EVEN THOUGH HE??S GOTTEN SHUT OUT AT THE OSCARS HE??S TAKEN HOME WELL-DESERVED GLOBES FOR THE WOLF OF WALL STREET (WHICH HAS AGED VERY WELL) AND THE AVIATOR (DITTO) AND WILL WIN HIS THIRD THIS YEAR. PLUS THIS CATEGORY IS INSANE. WILL SMITH FOR CONCUSSION? METHINKS THE HFPA GOT A BIT STARSTRUCK HERE INSTEAD OF VOTING FOR MORE DESERVING CANDIDATES THOUGH THIS IS ALSO THE RESULT OF FILMS LIKE THE BIG SHORT PERHAPS THE MOST RAGE-INDUCING THING THIS SIDE OF MAKING A MURDERER AND THE MARTIAN BEING IN THE COMEDY CATEGORY WHICH IS EVEN CRAZIER. KEVIN: YEAH THE CATEGORY PLACEMENT IS ALWAYS MAJORLY RIDICULOUS HERE. THE BIG SHORT?ŸWAS LESS HA-HA FUNNY THAN IT WAS WEEP-SILENT-TEARS-FOR-HUMANITY FUNNY THOUGH I KIND OF BUY THE MARTIAN IN THIS CATEGORY. (THE ??MATT DAMON ON MARS!? ONE-MAN SHOW HAD SOME GOOD NYUKS!) IT??S WHY THE MARTIAN WILL LIKELY TAKE HOME THE BEST COMEDY PRIZE INSTEAD OF THE BUZZIER TRAINWRECK?ŸOR MELISSA MCCARTHY'S GUT-BUSTING ACTION SPOOF SPY WHICH WAS FOR MY MONEY THE MOST ENTERTAINING??AND SHOULDN'T THAT MAKE IT THE BEST???MOVIE OF THE YEAR. MY RELIGION IS ROSE BYRNE??S PERFORMANCE IN THAT FILM. MARLOW: ROSE BYRNE IS SO DELICIOUSLY GOOD IN THAT. SHE MADE OUR BEST PERFORMANCES OF THE YEAR LIST TOO! KEVIN: THE MORE INTERESTING RACE THOUGH IS BEST ACTRESS IN A COMEDY WHICH PITS BFFS AND RENOWNED COOL KIDS AMY SCHUMER AND JENNIFER LAWRENCE WHO IS NOMINATED FOR JOY AGAINST EACH OTHER. WHOO-EE WAS JOY A STINKER OF A MOVIE! BUT LAWRENCE COMMANDED THE SCREEN AND WAS FEISTY AND DID HER LAWRENCE THANG WHICH IS WHY I THINK SHE STANDS A PRETTY GOOD SHOT OF TAKING THE TROPHY FROM THE FAR MORE DESERVING SCHUMER AND THE SUPES ADORBZ LILY TOMLIN WHO IS SO SO GOOD IN GRANDMA.?Ÿ MY SNEAKING SUSPICION THOUGH IS THAT THE HFPA WON'T BE ABLE TO RESIST THE FAWNING HEADLINES THAT WOULD ACCOMPANY WHAT WOULD SURELY BE A SENSATIONAL SPEECH SHOULD SCHUMER WIN. BUCKLE DOWN FOR SOME UNBRIDLED K-FAL ENTHUSIASM?ŸIF SHE DOES! MARLOW: JOY WAS PRETTYYYY PRETTYYYY BAD AND I??M A BIG DAVID O. RUSSELL FAN??EVEN ENJOYED THE BATSHIT I HEART HUCKABEES ALBEIT MOSTLY FOR NAOMI WATTS AND MARKY MARK??S GUNG-HO TURNS. OUT OF ALL THE NOMINEES HERE I THINK SCHUMER IS THE MOST DESERVING FOR TRAINWRECK AND I??M HOPING SHE??LL EKE OUT A SURPRISE WIN. SHE MANAGED THE DRAMATIC MOMENTS JUST AS WELL AS THE COMEDIC ONES AND THAT EULOGY SEQUENCE ALONE IS A MORE IMPRESSIVE ACTING FEAT THAN ANYTHING I SAW IN JOY DESPITE LIKE YOU SAID THE MAGNETISM OF J.LAW. EITHER WAY I??M SURE THERE??LL BE SOME GREAT GIFABLE MOMENTS OF THE TWO POSING WITH THE GLOBE AND IN-N-OUT BURGERS ALTHOUGH MAYBE THAT??S JUST ME PROJECTING. KEVIN: IF NBC DOESN??T HAVE CAMERA OPERATORS ENTIRELY DEDICATED TO DOCUMENTING J.LAW AND AMY THEN I DON??T KNOW WHAT??S REAL ANYMORE. MARLOW: FOR THE BEST MOTION PICTURE ?? COMEDY AND BEST ACTOR COMEDY I THINK WE??VE GOT A MARTIAN TWOFER FOR FILM AND MATT DAMON. DESPITE HIS UNFORTUNATE WHITE PRIVILEGE MOMENT ON HBO??S PROJECT GREENLIGHT DAMON??S BEEN ONE OF THE MOST CONSISTENTLY GOOD ACTORS (AND DUDES) IN HOLLYWOOD OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES AND HIS PERFORMANCES AGE SURPRISINGLY WELL??ESPECIALLY HIS DEMENTED ONE IN THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY WHICH DESERVED ALL THE AWARDS. SO TO QUOTE TEAM AMERICA: WORLD POLICE I THINK MATT DAAAAAAAYYYMIN WILL HAVE A VERY BIG NIGHT. KEVIN: THAT IS A VERY APT TEAM AMERICA?ŸQUOTE. AND HERE IS A VERY APT KEVIN FALLON QUOTE: ??IF SYLVESTER STALLONE DOESN'T WIN A GOLDEN GLOBE FOR CREED?ŸI??M SENDING FLAMING BAGS OF DOG POO TO EVERY MEMBER OF THE HOLLYWOOD FOREIGN PRESS.? AND FOR BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS I??D SAY ALICIA VIKANDER TAKES IT FOR EX MACHINA. MY HEART IS WITH KATE WINSLET AND JENNIFER JASON LEIGH. MY SOUL IS WITH THE YEAR??S BIGGEST BREAKOUT STAR THE SWEDE WHO WAS IN EVERY GODDAMN MOVIE THE SPRITELY ING??NUE WHO NEARLY MADE THE DANISH GIRL?ŸWATCHABLE. THIS IS HER REWARD. MARLOW: KRISTEN STEWART DESERVES THE BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS GLOBE FOR HER EMOTIONALLY RAW AND NERVY PERFORMANCE IN CLOUDS OF SILS MARIA BUT ALAS SHE WAS LOOKED OVER BY THE HFPA??THIS DESPITE BECOMING THE FIRST AMERICAN SINCE ADRIEN BRODY (FOR THE PIANIST) TO WIN A C??SAR FRANCE'S EQUIVALENT OF AN OSCAR. BUT YES VIKANDER WOULD BE MY SECOND CHOICE AND DEFINITELY DESERVES IT (EVEN THOUGH THE BEST PERFORMANCE IN THE FILM BELONGS TO OSCAR ISAAC WHO MAKES AN EXCELLENT SILICON VALLEY EGOMANIAC KILLER DANCE MOVES AND ALL). SLY IS FINE AND I STILL THINK THE STORY ABOUT HOW HE GOT RICHARD GERE FIRED OFF OF LORDS OF FLATBUSH IS ONE OF THE FUNNIEST THINGS I??VE EVER HEARD (IT INVOLVES A MESSY SANDWICH YOU MUST READ IT HERE) BUT MY CHOICE FOR BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR GOES TO PAUL DANO FOR HIS TREMENDOUS TURN AS THE BEACH BOYS?? BRIAN WILSON IN LOVE & MERCY. HE PULLED OFF A TREMENDOUS FEAT BRINGING THE CREATIVE PROCESS TO MAD THRILLING LIFE. KEVIN: BUT ALSO LET??S TALK ABOUT TV! I LOVE TV. I LOVE THE GOLDEN GLOBES?? BATSHIT TASTE IN TV. ARE THIS YEAR??S NOMINEES THE BEST TELEVISION SERIES AND ACTORS FROM THIS PAST YEAR? OH GOOD LORD NOT AT ALL. BUT THEY ARE FUN AND BUZZY AND DRIVING CONVERSATION AND INTERESTING AND ADVENTUROUS. THE GLOBES LIKE TO REWARD THE TV SHOWS THAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT. AND THIS YEAR EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT THAT FELLA MR. ROBOT. I EXPECT A SWEEP: BEST DRAMA BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR FOR CHRISTIAN SLATER AND BEST ACTOR FOR RAMI MALEK. SORRY JON HAMM! MARLOW: ALL I CAN REALLY PROCESS RIGHT NOW IS MAKING A MURDERER BUT I??LL DO MY BEST HERE TO FREE UP SOME BRAIN SPACE. AS MUCH AS I LOVE THE IDEA OF A MR. ROBOT CLEAN SWEEP I THINK HAMM WILL TAKE THE GLOBE HERE AS A WELL-DESERVED STATUE FOR HIS ENTIRE RUN ON MAD MEN??THOUGH MY PERSONAL CHOICE WOULD BE MALEK FOR SURE. AND A BEST SUPPORTING TROPHY FOR SLATER WILL MAKE UP FOR THE FACT THAT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN NOMINATED AS BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR FOR HEATHERS (I STAND BY THIS). AS FOR ACTRESS IN A DRAMA IT??S GOING TO VIOLA DAVIS. SHE??S GOT THE AWARDS SHOW TRIFECTA OF POWERHOUSE ACTRESS GREAT SPEECH-GIVER AND CAN SERIOUSLY ROCK A DRESS (THOSE ARMS?? BEST IN THE BIZ). THOUGH MY CHOICE WOULD ACTUALLY BE TARAJI P. HENSON FOR EMPIRE WHO ABSOLUTELY SLAYS AS COOKIE ONE OF THE MOST FUN CHARACTERS ON TV. KEVIN: IN MY DREAM VIOLA DAVIS AND TARAJI P. HENSON TIE AND WEEP INTO EACH OTHER??S ARMS AS I SOB INTO MY WHITE WINE AT THE BEAUTY OF IT ALL. (BUT I ALSO THINK DAVIS WILL WIN. SORRY TARAJI!) AS FOR THE COMEDY RACES? WHO THE HELL FREAKING KNOWS. HAVE YOU SEEN THAT LIST? CASUAL MOZART IN THE JUNGLE ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK TRANSPARENT VEEP AND SILICON VALLEY. TRANSPARENT WHICH WON LAST YEAR IS DESERVING OF A REPEAT FOR ITS SOULFUL AND RICH SECOND SEASON. BUT DON'T BE SURPRISED IF THESE CLOWNS DO SOMETHING REALLY WEIRD LIKE NAME MOZART IN THE JUNGLE?ŸITS WINNER.?Ÿ MARLOW: I DIDN??T EVEN KNOW WHAT MOZART IN THE JUNGLE WAS ABOUT UNTIL A FEW MONTHS AGO TO BE HONEST. IT SOUNDS LIKE A SERIES ABOUT AYAHUASCA CEREMONIES OR SOMETHING. KEVIN:?ŸHONESTLY I'D RATHER WATCH A SHOW ABOUT THAT. ANYWAY THE COMEDY ACTING RACES ARE ALWAYS TOUGH TO PREDICT. LAST YEAR GINA RODRIGUEZ STOLE MY HEART WITH HER JANE THE VIRGIN SPEECH AND COULD FEASIBLY REPEAT THIS YEAR THOUGH I THINK THE CW??S NEW IT GIRL RACHEL BLOOM COULD STEAL IT FOR CRAZY EX-GIRLFRIEND. SIMILARLY I??D BE GASSED FOR JEFFREY TAMBOR TO TAKE IT AGAIN BUT I CAN??T IMAGINE THE GLOBES RESISTING THE URGE TO GIVE AZIZ ANSARI THE CHANCE TO DELIVER A QUIRKY-CHARMING-AWKWARD-COOL SPEECH FOR THE QUIRKY-CHARMING-AWKWARD-COOL MASTER OF NONE. MARLOW: AZIZ! WOULD LOVE THAT. DEEP DOWN I??M HOPING THAT EMPIRE WINS FOR BEST DRAMA AND THEN SEAN PENN PULLS A KANYE AND STAGE-CRASHES LEE DANIELS?? ACCEPTANCE SPEECH??ONLY TO HAVE TARAJI COME IN WITH THE LEFT-FIELD HAYMAKER KNOCKING HIM OUT COLD. A BOY CAN DREAM. ,18160.0
1329,10390233.0,2016-01-28T23:45:00+00:00,MEET THE ANTI-TRUMP COLLEGE KID BEHIND THE KANYE WEST SUPER PAC,RAPPER KANYE WEST IS (MAYBE PROBABLY WHO THE HELL KNOWS) RUNNING FOR THE HIGHEST OFFICE IN THE LAND IN FOUR YEARS TIME. IN THE MONTHS SINCE WEST MADE HIS SURPRISE ANNOUNCEMENT ON-STAGE AT LAST YEAR??S VMAS THERE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS TO SET UP PRO-KANYE SUPER PACS. FOR INSTANCE READY FOR KANYE LAUNCHED BY A REPUBLICAN BALTIMORE NATIVE RELEASED A COUPLE OF WEB ADS. NOW COLIN MACKINTOSH??A 20-YEAR-OLD SOPHOMORE STUDYING REAL ESTATE AT DEPAUL UNIVERSITY??WANTS IN ON THE FUN. AND HE WANTS TO DO IT RIGHT. ??IF DONALD TRUMP CAN FEAR-MONGER HIS WAY TO THE REPUBLICAN FRONT RUNNER I DON??T SEE WHY KANYE??WHO IS FAR MORE LEVELHEADED??CAN??T GAIN SUBSTANTIAL GROUND WITH HIS EXTENSIVE FAN BASE? MACKINTOSH TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. ??AFTER REVIEWING SEARCHES UNDER THE FEC CAMPAIGN AND COMMITTEE FILINGS I FOUND OUT THAT ONE OR TWO PEOPLE HAD ALREADY ATTEMPTED TO FILE A KANYE WEST SUPER PAC BUT??IF MEMORY SERVES??THEY FILED INCORRECTLY FORGOT THEIR COVER LETTER AND HAD NO WEBSITE? HE CONTINUED. ??I FIGURED IF SOMEONE WAS GOING TO START A KANYE WEST SUPER PAC THEY SHOULD AT LEAST DO IT PROPERLY. MACKINTOSH WHO FILED WITH THE FEC ON THURSDAY IS THE COLLEGE KID FOUNDER OF YEEZUS RISING PAC. YOU CAN DONATE VIA ITS WEBSITE USING CASH OR BITCOIN. HE CLAIMS HE RECEIVED A GRAND TOTAL OF FIVE DONATIONS IN THE HOUR SINCE THE SITE WENT LIVE. (ALL OF THE DONORS HAVE SO FAR CONTRIBUTED $20 OR LESS.) ??ALL I??M HOPING NOW IS THAT THE REAL KANYE WEST DOESN??T ACTUALLY FILE FOR PRESIDENT YET BECAUSE THEN THAT WOULD BAR MY ORGANIZATION AND HIS CAMPAIGN STAFF FROM COORDINATING??SIMILAR TO THE TACTIC THAT JEB BUSH USED LAST YEAR? MACKINTOSH SAID. (IT IS ILLEGAL FOR SUPER PACS AND CAMPAIGNS TO COORDINATE. BUT IF THE HYPOTHETICAL KANYE 2020 CAMPAIGN ISN??T OFFICIALLY LAUNCHED THEN YES THE SUPER PAC COULD POTENTIALLY TALK STRATEGY AND CONSULT.) WEST??S PUBLICIST DID NOT RESPOND TO THE DAILY BEAST??S REQUEST FOR COMMENT ON THE NEW PRO-KANYE POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEE. MACKINTOSH MADE YEEZUS RISING AN AFFILIATED COMMITTEE WITH HIS ORIGINAL 527 GROUP THAT HE FOUNDED HIS FRESHMAN YEAR. HE WANTED TO CREATE A SUPER PAC THAT ??WOULD REPRESENT THE POLITICAL VIEWS OF A DEMOGRAPHIC THAT ISN??T AS FINANCIALLY EQUIPPED AS THE KOCH BROTHERS NRA OR PRIORITIES USA.? HE SEEMS TO HAVE FOUND THAT UNIFYING CAUSE IN #KANYE2020. ??KANYE SEEMS TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND AND UNDERSTANDS THAT JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE IS DIFFERENT THAN YOU DOESN??T MEAN YOU HAVE TO BAR THEM FROM THE COUNTRY OR DEPORT THEM? MACKINTOSH SAID REFERRING TO TRUMP??S CONTROVERSIAL MUSLIM BAN PROPOSAL. ??IT DOESN??T TAKE A DEGREE FROM WHARTON TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO THINK WITH AN OPEN MIND.? IF WEST ENDS UP LAUNCHING A PRESIDENTIAL RUN IN 2019 HE WILL LIKELY RUN AS A DEMOCRAT OR A LEFT-LEANING INDEPENDENT. THE HIP-HOP ARTIST WAS ONCE TIGHT WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA (ALTHOUGH HE HAS MORE RECENTLY FELT ??USED? BY HIS FORMER PAL) AND HE AND HIS WIFE KIM KARDASHIAN HAVE BEEN ALLIES OF THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE HILLARY CLINTON AND OTHER LIBERAL POLITICIANS. BUT THAT DOESN??T MEAN HE WON??T MAKE TIME TO OPENLY PRAISE A REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES. ??WHEN I RUN FOR PRESIDENT I??D PREFER NOT TO RUN AGAINST SOMEONE? WEST TOLD VANITY FAIR LAST YEAR. ??I WOULD BE LIKE ??I WANT TO WORK WITH YOU.?? AS SOON AS I HEARD [BEN] CARSON SPEAK I TRIED FOR THREE WEEKS TO GET ON THE PHONE WITH HIM. I WAS LIKE THIS IS THE MOST BRILLIANT GUY. AND I THINK ALL THE PEOPLE RUNNING RIGHT NOW HAVE SOMETHING THAT EACH OF THE OTHERS NEEDS. BUT THE IDEA OF THIS SEPARATION AND THIS GLADIATOR BATTLE TAKES AWAY FROM THE MAIN FOCUS THAT THE WORLD NEEDS HELP AND THE WORLD NEEDS ALL THE PEOPLE IN A POSITION OF POWER OR INFLUENCE TO COME TOGETHER.? #YEEZUS2020. ,5700.0

HE GOT WATERBOARDED BUT WITH BLOOD? DIGREGORIO RECALLS. ??THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER INSTANCE WHERE HE KIND OF WENT BLIND FOR A WHILE BECAUSE IT??S SO VISCOUS AND STICKY. IT GOT IN HIS EYES AND HE COULDN??T GET IT OUT.??Ÿ CAMPBELL SUMS UP TEN EPISODES?? WORTH OF GUNS GUTS AND DEADITE DISMEMBERMENTS WITH ASH-APPROVED SIMPLICITY: ??PEOPLE WANTED BLOOD MAN AND THEY GOT IT.??Ÿ FOR MORE THAN TWO DECADES OF COURSE WHAT THE ??PEOPLE? REALLY WANTED WAS MORE ASH.

TWENTY-THREE YEARS AFTER ARMY OF DARKNESS THE LAST IN SAM RAIMI??S BELOVED EVIL DEAD TRILOGY ASH VS EVIL DEAD BROUGHT CAMPBELL BACK TO HIS MOST ICONIC ROLE PICKING UP WITH THE CHAINSAW-HANDED HERO WELL INTO HIS MIDDLE AGE.

TEN EPISODES AND UNTOLD BARRELS OF BLOOD LATER NOT MUCH ABOUT ASH HAS CHANGED. HE FALLS IN SORT-OF-LOVE WITH A COP BUT THE ROMANCE COMES TO AN ABRUPT BLOODY END. HE BECOMES VAGUELY ATTACHED TO HIS TWO SIDEKICKS PEDRO (PABLO SIMON BOLIVAR) AND KELLY (DANA DELORENZO) BUT THEIR ARCS END WITH THEM AGHAST AT THEIR FRIEND WHO JUST WILLINGLY TRADED THE FATE OF THE WORLD FOR A CHANCE TO SKIP TOWN WITH THEM IN HIS DELTA 88.?Ÿ ASH MAY BE TOO FOOLISH TO EVER GROW UP BUT FOR DIGREGORIO AND MANY OF ASH??S FANS THAT??S PART OF HIS APPEAL. ??THE FINALE EPISODES TO ME SHOW THAT THIS GUY HAS GROWN MAYBE TWO PERCENT WHICH IS ALL YOU CAN HOPE FOR IN A CHARACTER LIKE THIS? DIGREGORIO SAYS. ??YOU DON??T WANT HUGE CHARACTER SHIFTS.

PEOPLE ARE GONNA CROAK. ASH IS SAVING A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT HE??S ALSO GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE KILLED TOO.? THAT THE BEER-BELLIED ASH IS SO UNLIKE MOST OF POP CULTURE??S HYPER-COMPETENT HEROES CAMPBELL SAYS IS WHAT KEEPS LURING HIM BACK TO EVIL DEAD. ??HE??S SO FLAWED. FIRST SCENE [OF THE SERIES] THAT SAM [RAIMI] WRITES FOR ASH HE??S PUTTING ON A MAN-GIRDLE.

IN THE SEASON FINALE ASH RETURNS TO THAT OLD CABIN IN THE WOODS FOR A SUPERNATURAL SHOWDOWN WITH LUCY LAWLESS??S RUBY WHO REVEALS HERSELF TO BE THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR OF THE NECRONOMICON. CAMPBELL SAYS THE CABIN??S INTERIOR SET FAITHFULLY RECREATED ROOM-BY-ROOM FROM RAIMI??S 1981 ORIGINAL BLEW HIM AWAY. ??IT GAVE ME HIVES. IT MADE THE HAIR ON THE BACK OF MY HEAD STAND UP? CAMPBELL SAYS. ??THEY GOT THE CABIN SO RIGHT.

THE TOPIC PROMPTS CAMPBELL INTO ANOTHER FIT OF ASH-ISMS. ??PEOPLE ARE SNEAKING ONTO THE PROPERTY THEY??VE NOW DISMANTLING TWO-THIRDS OF THE CHIMNEY AND I TELL THEM STAY OFF THAT GODDAMN PROPERTY! YOU??RE GONNA GET BUCKSHOT UP THE ASS!? HE SAYS. ??THE ADDRESS GOT OUT ON THE INTERNET. SO I??VE BEEN TO SIGNINGS WHERE PEOPLE BRING A BRICK FROM THAT STUPID FIREPLACE AND I SIGN THEIR LIMESTONE BRICK.? MINUS ASH??S GRUFF POSTURING ONE COULD ALMOST INFER A TENDERNESS IN CAMPBELL??S VOICE FOR THOSE ??PEOPLE???THE EVIL DEAD DEVOTEES??HE KEEPS TALKING ABOUT. WHEN ASKED WHAT RESERVATIONS HE HAD ABOUT STEPPING INTO ASH??S SHOES AGAIN CAMPBELL REPLIES PROMPTLY ??JUST LETTING FANS DOWN THAT??S THE ONLY THING I EVER WORRIED ABOUT.? HE BETRAYS HIS AFFECTION WHEN TALKING ABOUT THE TATTOOS THAT EVIL DEAD FANS SEND HIM TOO. (HE HAS OVER 300 SAVED IN HIS ??COLLECTION.?)?Ÿ A DETERMINATION NOT TO LET FANS DOWN ALSO SEEMS TO HAVE MOTIVATED CAMPBELL??S ONE MANDATE ON SET HIS ??BOLD STATEMENT? AS THE CUSTODIAN OF ASH??S UNIQUE LEGACY: ??I??M NOT SAYING ANYTHING THAT I DON??T WANT ASH TO SAY. IT??S JUST THAT SIMPLE? HE SAYS. ??AND HE BETTER NOT SOUND LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. ASH HAS TO BE AN AMALGAM HE HAS TO BE A THROWBACK. HE??S A LUDDITE. BUT HE??S AN IDIOT SAVANT. HE??S ACTUALLY A WAY MORE COMPLEX CHARACTER THAN I THINK MOST PEOPLE THINK.? DIGREGORIO PROMISES THAT ASH VS EVIL DEAD??S SECOND SEASON??PREMIERE DATE TBA??WILL DIVULGE MORE ABOUT ASH AND HIS BACKSTORY BEYOND WHAT LITTLE WE??VE LEARNED THROUGH HIS ACID TRIP AND THREE MOVIES.?Ÿ BUT CAMPBELL GETS TO THE HEART OF WHY FANS REALLY KEEP RETURNING DECADE AFTER DECADE TO ASH AND HIS BATTLE AGAINST THE UNDEAD. ??[EVIL DEAD] WAS THE LITTLE MOVIE THAT COULD. WE??RE NOT STAR WARS??WE NEVER WERE.

HARVARD HONORS GRADUATE A MEMBER OF THE SWIMMING AND POLO TEAM. BEFORE BECOMING THE BACHELOR HE WORKED FOR THE PRESIDENT??S OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET AND THE U.S. EMBASSY IN MEXICO THEN GOT AN MBA FROM STANFORD UNIVERSITY. HE WAS TALL HANDSOME ACCOMPLISHED: THE KIND OF MAN THAT LOOKS LIKE HE WAS BORN WEARING A TAILORED SUIT. BEING THE BACHELOR USED TO MEAN SOMETHING. HE WAS THE KIND OF MAN IT WAS WORTH MAKING A FOOL OF YOURSELF OR CLAWING AT THE EYES OF OTHER BIG-HAIRED CHOKERED CONTESTANTS FOR THE CHANCE TO MARRY.

150,9625285.0,2016-01-05T05:01:00+00:00,MEALS ON WHEELS??BUT FOR POT,EIGHTEEN YEARS AFTER ALASKANS WERE GRANTED PERMISSION TO USE MEDICAL MARIJUANA THERE IS STILL NOT A SINGLE PLACE TO BUY IT. IT??S A CRUEL CONUNDRUM CAUSED BY THE LACK OF A PROVISION ABOUT DISPENSARIES IN THE BILL LEGALIZING IT. FED UP WITH THE TREATMENT OF THESE MEN AND WOMEN SOME NONPROFITS IN ALASKA HAVE BEGUN GIVING AWAY FREE MARIJUANA TO VETERANS AND SICK PATIENTS. CALL IT THE POT VERSION OF MEALS ON WHEELS THE CANNABIS ARMY OR THE REEFER BUYER??S CLUB??WHATEVER YOU CALL IT IT??S WORKING. IN PAST YEARS SOME ALASKANS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO BYPASS THE SYSTEM BY OFFERING ??FREE? MARIJUANA BUT REQUIRING A DONATION. RECENTLY THE STATE BEGAN CRACKING DOWN LANDING A FEW OF THESE PEOPLE IN COURT. ADULTS IN ALASKA ARE PERMITTED TO GIFT UP TO AN OUNCE OF MARIJUANA BUT ARE NOT ALLOWED TO RECEIVE ANY MONETARY PAYMENT IN RETURN THIS IS THE PART THAT THESE GROUPS HAVE SUBTRACTED FROM THE EQUATION. ONE GROUP LEADING THE CHARGE IS ALASKA??S GREEN ANGELS A 400-MEMBER FACEBOOK GROUP STARTED BY THREE FRIENDS. DARBY ANDREWS ONE OF THE FOUNDERS IS A VETERAN HIMSELF WHO USES MARIJUANA TO TREAT HIS POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER. WHILE HE??S LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO GROW THE MEDICINE HE NEEDS HE??S ACUTELY AWARE OF HIS LESS FORTUNATE PEERS. AFTER GATHERING THE MEDICINE HE NEEDS FROM THE FEW PLANTS THAT THE STATE ALLOWS ALASKANS TO GROW AT HOME HE MAKES A STASH TO GIVE TO SOMEONE IN NEED. ??ANYTHING EXTRA WE USE TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE? HE TELLS THE DAILY BEAST. BEYOND THE LACK OF DISPENSARIES ANDREWS CITES THE LACK OF DOCTORS WILLING TO PRESCRIBE IT AS ANOTHER ROADBLOCK. ALASKA DESPITE THE DIFFICULTY VETERANS FACE IN OBTAINING MARIJUANA HAS LED THE WAY FOR MARIJUANA REFORM IN MANY WAYS. IN 1975 IT BECAME THE FIRST STATE TO ALLOW ITS RESIDENTS TO KEEP A SMALL AMOUNT FOR PERSONAL USE. IN 1998 FOLLOWING SIMILAR DECISIONS IN NEW MEXICO AND CALIFORNIA IT LEGALIZED MARIJUANA FOR MEDICAL USE. THEN IN A HISTORIC VOTE LAST FEBRUARY IT BECAME THE THIRD STATE IN THE NATION TO LEGALIZE MARIJUANA RECREATIONALLY. STILL WITH THE NEW LAW SET TO TAKE EFFECT IN LATE SUMMER OR FALL OF THIS YEAR VETERANS ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND WAYS TO GET THE MEDICINE THAT THEY NEED. ACTIVISTS WERE HOPEFUL THAT A REFORM ALLOWING VETERANS AFFAIRS TO PRESCRIBE THE DRUG WOULD ALLEVIATE THIS PROBLEM BUT THE PROVISION DID NOT MAKE IT INTO THE FINAL BILL. ALASKA??S MEDICAL MARIJUANA SYSTEM IS BROKEN AND NO ONE SEEMS WILLING TO FIX IT. ??IT??S LIKE [THE STATE] SAID ??SURE GO AHEAD YOU CAN HAVE IT BUT YOU CANT BUY IT SELL IT OR TRANSPORT IT??? SAYS ANDREWS. ??IT??S JUST SUPPOSED TO MAGICALLY APPEAR. IN A WAY THAT??S THE SCENARIO HIS GROUP HAS CREATED. THOSE WHO NEED CANNABIS????ANGELS IN NEED???CAN POST ON THE FACEBOOK GROUP AND ASK FOR HELP. THOSE WITH SOME MARIJUANA TO SPARE????ANGELS IN DEED???RESPOND. AT FIRST ANDREWS AND THE OTHER TWO FOUNDERS WERE THE PRIMARY DONORS CATERING TO A SMALL GROUP OF MEMBERS THAT THEY KNEW FIRST HAND. BUT OVER THE COURSE OF A YEAR THE OPERATION HAS ??TAKEN ON A LIFE OF ITS OWN? NOW A VIRTUAL HUB FOR THOSE IN NEED TO MEET THOSE ITCHING TO ??DO A GOOD DEED.? THE GREEN ANGELS HAVE RECEIVED CONSIDERABLE SUPPORT FROM THE OUTSIDE WITH THE WEED FOR WARRIORS PROJECT GIVING THEM A SHOUT OUT ON FACEBOOK. ??VETERANS TAKING CARING OF VETERANS BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT DOESN??T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT US SO WE MUST TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN? WEED FOR WARRIORS WROTE. MANY IN THE MEDICAL WORLD HAVE BEEN VOCAL ABOUT THEIR SUPPORT OF CANNABIS TO TREAT PTSD WHICH DOCTORS BELIEVE IS ONE OF REASONS THE SUICIDE RATE AMONG VETERANS 22 A DAY IS SO HIGH. MORE THAN HALF OF THE 24 STATES IN THE U.S. LIST PTSD AS A QUALIFYING CONDITION FOR MEDICAL MARIJUANA AND VETERANS NATIONWIDE HAVE COME OUT IN SUPPORT OF IT WITH THEIR OWN TESTIMONY. IN NOVEMBER THE DAILY BEAST COVERED THE STORY OF AN IRAQI VETERAN WHO SAID USING MEDICAL MARIJUANA TO TREAT HIS PTSD GOT HIM OFF OPIATES AND SAVED HIS LIFE. ??ALL I WANTED TO DO WAS LEARN ABOUT IT BECAUSE I WAS FUCKING AMAZED AT THE WAY I FELT. I GOT MYSELF BACK? HE SAID. ??ONCE YOU START FEELING YOU START HEALING. IT??S LIKE FROZEN MAN.? THAT??S OF COURSE NOT TO SAY THAT EVERYONE IN THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY IS IN FAVOR OF USING MEDICAL MARIJUANA TO TREAT PTSD. IN A 2014 HEARING REP. JOHN C. FLEMING??BOTH A PHYSICIAN AND MILITARY VETERAN??SPOKE OUT AGAINST IT. ??HAVING TREATED VETERANS IN VA HOSPITALS ONE OF THE LAST THINGS IN THE WORLD WE SHOULD BE DOING IS GIVING ADDICTING SUBSTANCES TO PEOPLE WITH PTSD? HE SAID. ??ANY GOOD PHYSICIAN WOULD TELL YOU THAT.? THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS SPECIFICALLY ADVISES AGAINST IT ON THEIR WEBSITE CITING A LACK OF PROOF THAT IT WORKS. ??CONTROLLED STUDIES HAVE NOT BEEN CONDUCTED TO EVALUATE THE SAFETY OR EFFECTIVENESS OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA FOR PTSD? IT READS. ??THUS THERE IS NO EVIDENCE AT THIS TIME THAT MARIJUANA IS AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR PTSD.? ONE RESEARCHER IN THE U.S. SUE SISLEY RECEIVED APPROVAL TO TEST MARIJUANA ON VETERANS WITH PTSD BUT AFTER BEING FIRED FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA SHE??S STILL STRUGGLING TO FIND FUNDING. UNTIL SHE DOES VETERANS AND SICK PATIENTS IN ALASKA WILL HAVE TO RELY ON PEOPLE LIKE THE GREEN ANGELS FOR THEIR MEDICINE??A GROUP THAT ANDREWS HOPES WILL CONTINUE TO GAIN MORE DONORS. ??DON??T AFRAID TO GET OUT THERE? HE INSTRUCTS THE PATIENTS. ??ACCEPT ANY HELP THAT COMES.? ,4557.0

DALEIDEN HAS ALSO BEEN ISSUED AN ADDITIONAL INDICTMENT FOR PROHIBITION OF THE PURCHASE AND SALE OF HUMAN ORGANS LIKELY BASED ON HIS MANY FILMED ATTEMPTS TO NEGOTIATE THE SALE OF HUMAN FETAL TISSUE. UNDER TEXAS LAW AN OFFENDER VIOLATES THE PROHIBITION OF THE PURCHASE AND SALE OF HUMAN ORGANS IF ??HE KNOWINGLY OR INTENTIONALLY OFFERS TO BUY OFFERS TO SELL ACQUIRES RECEIVES SELLS OR TRANSFERS ANY HUMAN ORGAN FOR VALUABLE CONSIDERATION.? ??WE WERE CALLED UPON TO INVESTIGATE ALLEGATIONS OF CRIMINAL CONDUCT BY PLANNED PARENTHOOD GULF COAST (PPGC)? HARRIS COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY DEVON ANDERSON SAID IN A PRESS RELEASE. ??AS I STATED AT THE OUTSET OF THIS INVESTIGATION WE MUST GO WHERE THE EVIDENCE LEADS US. ALL THE EVIDENCE UNCOVERED IN THE COURSE OF THIS INVESTIGATION WAS PRESENTED TO THE GRAND JURY. I RESPECT THEIR DECISION ON THIS DIFFICULT CASE.? ACCORDING TO THE PRESS RELEASE PPGC WAS ??CLEARED? OF ANY LAW-BREAKING AFTER THE GRAND JURY SPENT OVER TWO MONTHS REVIEWING THE ALLEGATIONS THAT PLANNED PARENTHOOD ILLEGALLY SOLD DONATED FETAL TISSUE FOR PROFIT. DALEIDEN AND MERRITT WEREN??T SO LUCKY. TAMPERING WITH A GOVERNMENTAL RECORD IS A SECOND-DEGREE FELONY AND DALEIDEN??S ADDITIONAL INDICTMENT FOR SOLICITING HUMAN ORGANS IS A CLASS A MISDEMEANOR. DALEIDEN??S ALLEGATIONS WERE FIRST PUBLICIZED IN JULY 2015 WHEN HE RELEASED THE FIRST OF A LONG SERIES OF SECRETLY-FILMED VIDEOS IN WHICH HE AND HIS COLLEAGUES POSING AS REPRESENTATIVES FROM A BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH COMPANY AND USING FAKE IDENTIFICATION UNSUCCESSFULLY ATTEMPTED TO PERSUADE PLANNED PARENTHOOD REPRESENTATIVES TO VIOLATE FEDERAL LAW PROHIBITING THE SALE OF HUMAN FETAL TISSUE ??FOR VALUABLE CONSIDERATION.? ONE OF THE GROUP??S MOST WIDELY-VIEWED VIDEOS WAS FILMED AT A PLANNED PARENTHOOD CENTER IN TEXAS. IN THE FIFTH CMP RELEASE DALEIDEN AND MERITT POSE AS BUYERS AND APPROACH THE PPGC DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH ABOUT PURCHASING FETAL TISSUE OFFERING COMPENSATION THAT IS IMPLIED TO GO BEYOND OR ??HIGHER? THAN WHAT IS LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE. UNDER FALSE PRETENSES DALEIDEN ALSO ENTERS A TEXAS PLANNED PARENTHOOD CLINIC??S PATHOLOGICAL LAB AND EXAMINES DONATED FETAL TISSUE HIMSELF. PPGC HAS SINCE RELEASED IMAGES OF THE IDS THAT DALEIDEN AND MERRITT ALLEGEDLY USED IN TEXAS: TWO FAKE CALIFORNIA DRIVER??S LICENSES BEARING THE NAMES ??ROBERT DAOUD SARKIS? AND ??SUSAN TENNENBAUM.? THE PAIR USED THESE NAMES IN THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH PPGC EMPLOYEES. IN TEXAS SOMEONE CAN BE CHARGED WITH TAMPERING WITH A GOVERNMENTAL RECORD IF HE OR SHE ??MAKES PRESENTS OR USES ANY RECORD DOCUMENT OR THING WITH KNOWLEDGE OF ITS FALSITY AND WITH INTENT THAT IT BE TAKEN AS A GENUINE GOVERNMENTAL RECORD.? DALEIDEN??S ALLEGATIONS HAVE SPARKED SEVERAL FEDERAL-LEVEL ATTEMPTS TO STRIP PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF ITS FUNDING A GRUELING CONGRESSIONAL HEARING FOR ITS PRESIDENT CECILE RICHARDS AND AT LEAST A DOZEN STATE-LEVEL INVESTIGATIONS NONE OF WHICH HAVE FOUND EVIDENCE OF CRIMINAL WRONGDOING. PLANNED PARENTHOOD HAS SINCE CEASED ACCEPTING LEGALLY-PERMITTED REIMBURSEMENT FOR FETAL TISSUE DONATION. THE CRIMINAL INDICTMENTS AGAINST DALEIDEN COME ON THE HEELS OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD??S OWN CIVIL LAWSUIT AGAINST THE ANTI-ABORTION ACTIVIST WHICH IT ANNOUNCED ON JANUARY 14TH. PLANNED PARENTHOOD ALLEGES THAT DALEIDEN AND THE CMP ENGAGED IN ILLEGAL CONSPIRACY VIOLATED THE RACKETEER INFLUENCED AND CORRUPT ORGANIZATIONS (RICO) ACT ILLEGALLY RECORDED PLANNED PARENTHOOD REPRESENTATIVES WITHOUT CONSENT VIOLATED CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS AND COMMITTED FRAUD TO GAIN ACCESS TO CONFERENCES. THE INDICTMENT IS NOTABLE FOR BEING THE FIRST CRIMINAL CHARGE TO ARISE OUT OF THE MONTHS-LONG FUROR AROUND PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND FOR BEING ISSUED IN TEXAS WHERE STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL KEN PAXTON LED A PARTICULARLY VOCIFEROUS INVESTIGATION INTO THE WOMEN??S HEALTH ORGANIZATION. ,31640.0

HIS FACE IS THE FACE OF FUCKED. AND WE HAVE THE MEXICAN MARINES TO THANK. AS WE IN AMERICA CONTINUED TO BUY THE FUGITIVE EL CHAPO??S DRUGS AND SELL HIM GUNS IT HAD ONCE AGAIN FALLEN TO THE MARINES TO CATCH HIM. THE MARINES HAD CAPTURED HIM IN 2014 ONLY FOR HIM TO ESCAPE THIS PAST JULY VIA A TUNNEL THAT INCLUDED A MOTORCYCLE ON RAILS TO ZOOM HIM TO FREEDOM. THE MARINES WENT RIGHT BACK ON THE HUNT FOR MONTH AFTER MONTH. A CONVOY OF MARINES WAS ATTACKED ON CHRISTMAS DAY BUT FORTUNATELY NOBODY WAS SERIOUSLY HURT. THEIR LUCK RAN OUT THREE DAYS LATER WHEN TWO MARINES WERE KILLED. THE GUNMAN WAS IDENTIFIED AS JOSE MARIA PENUELAS RUBIO ALLEGEDLY AN EL CHAPO MINION IN THE SINALOA CARTEL. THE NAMES OF THE TWO MARINES WERE NOT RELEASED. THAT IS LIKELY BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS IN 2009 AFTER A MARINE WHO HAD BEEN KILLED BY A GRENADE TOSSED BY A CARTEL GUNMAN WAS LAUDED BY NAME AS A NATIONAL HERO. AT THE FUNERAL FULL MILITARY HONORS WERE ACCORDED ENSIGN MELQUISEDET ANGELO CORDOVA. HIS MOTHER SPOKE TO REPORTERS AFTERWARDS. ??THINKING AS A MOTHER I USED TO FEEL VERY SAD AND HURT FOR THE FAMILIES OF SOLDIERS AND POLICE WHO HAD BEEN KILLED? SHE SAID. ??IT WOULD MAKE ME CRY. AND NOW NOW IT IS MY TURN.? AFTER SHE RETURNED HOME FROM THE CEMETERY CARTEL GUNMEN BURST IN AND KILLED HER ALONG WITH HER OTHER SON HER DAUGHTER AND HER SISTER. LEST SOME VARIATION OF THAT BE REPEATED THE TWO MARINES KILLED JUST AFTER THIS CHRISTMAS WERE MOURNED PRIVATELY. THE BRAVERY OF THEIR COMRADES REMAINED ON PUBLIC DISPLAY AS THE MARINES PRESSED ON INTO THE NEW YEAR. AT 5 AM ON THURSDAY THE MARINES ACTED ON A TIP THAT ARMED MEN HAD BEEN SEEN IN THE VICINITY OF THE MOTEL DOUX IN THE SINALOA TOWN OF LOS MOCHIS. UNTIL THEN THE DOUX HAD BEEN KNOWN FOR ??LUXURY ACCOMMODATIONS ON A BEER BUDGET? OFFERING SPOTLESS ROOMS WITH A GREAT SHOWER FOR $50 A NIGHT. HAD THE FAMOUSLY ??RISK ADVERSE? ARMY BEEN ACTING ON THE TIP SOMEBODY MIGHT VERY WELL HAVE MADE A PHONE CALL AND A SEARCH WOULD HAVE ONLY PRODUCED SOME SUDDENLY VACATED ROOMS. THE INTEGRITY OF THE MARINES WAS PROVEN ANEW AS THEY APPROACHED THE MOTEL AND ENCOUNTERED GUNFIRE. A TWO HOUR FIREFIGHT ENSUED IN WHICH FIVE GUNMEN WERE KILLED. ONE MARINE WAS WOUNDED BUT IS EXPECTED TO RECOVER. WHEN IT WAS OVER THE MARINES RECAPTURED EL CHAPO. AS BEFORE THEY RESTRAINED THEMSELVES FROM KILLING OR EVEN BEATING HIM. A PHOTOGRAPH SHOWS HIM WITHOUT A SIGNIFICANT MARK AS HE SITS ON A BED AMIDST BEER BUDGET LUXURY A PIN-UP TACKED TO THE WALL. HIS HANDS WERE CUFFED IN FRONT OF HIM. HIS DIRTY T-SHIRT SUGGESTED HE MAY HAVE MADE SOME DESPERATE LAST MINUTE EFFORT TO HIDE PERHAPS ONCE AGAIN THROUGH A TUNNEL. HE NOW SAT AS DEJECTED AS A MOLE WITHOUT A HOLE. ALSO PRESENT WAS GAST??LUM ORSO IVAN CRUZ AKA ??EL CHOLO IV?­N? HE SAID TO BE ONE OF EL CHAPO??S RIGHT HAND MEN. HE IS KNOWN TO HAVE KEPT WITH A LONGTIME TRADITION AMONG CARTEL BOSSES OF SQUIRING BEAUTY QUEENS AND HE HAD ONCE DATED MISS SINALOA OF 2012 SUSANA MAR??A FLORES G?­MEZ. HE IS SAID TO HAVE ABANDONED HER DURING A GUN BATTLE WITH THE ARMY THE SAME YEAR AS HER CROWNING TELLING HER JUST TO TELL THE SOLDIERS THAT SHE HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED. SHE WAS SHOT TO DEATH. AT THE TIME OF THAT GUN BATTLE EL CHOLO IVAN HAD BEEN A FUGITIVE HAVING ESCAPED PRISON IN 2008. HE HAD BEEN ARRESTED LAST MARCH ONLY TO REGAIN HIS FREEDOM UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT REMAIN UNCLEAR. ON THURSDAY EL CHOLO IVAN WAS INITIALLY REPORTED TO HAVE ELUDED CAPTURE. BUT THE MARINES REPORTED OTHERWISE AND A PHOTO APPEARS TO SHOW HIM IN CUSTODY WITH EL CHAPO. BOTH EL CHAPO AND EL CHOLO IVAN NO DOUBT HOPE THEY WILL BE ABLE TO ESCAPE AS THEY EACH HAVE AT LEAST TWICE BEFORE. BUT EL CHAPO??S MORE RECENT PRISON BREAK WAS AN INTERNATIONAL EMBARRASSMENT FOR THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT. AN OBVIOUSLY ELATED PRESIDENT ENRIQUE PENA NIETO TWEETED THIS WEEK ??MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. WE??VE GOT HIM.? NIETO SURELY DOES NOT WANT TO JOIN GEORGE BUSH AS ANOTHER PRESIDENT WHO PREMATURELY DECLARED ??MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.? EL CHAPO WILL LIKELY HAVE CONSIDERABLE MORE DIFFICULTY IN ESCAPING THIS TIME. AND THERE IS A CHANCE HE MIGHT BE EXTRADITED TO THE UNITED STATES. SOME MEXICAN POLITICIANS ARE ALREADY CALLING FOR IT. OTHERS ARE SAYING THAT TURNING HIM OVER TO THE AMERICANS WOULD BE ADMITTING THAT MEXICO IS INCAPABLE OF HOLDING HIM. IF EL CHAPO DOES STAY IN MEXICO THOSE WHO SPOKE OUT AGAINST EXTRADITION WOULD HAVE CONTINUING CAUSE TO PROVE THEY WERE RIGHT BY KEEPING HIM BEHIND BARS. HE SEEMS TO UNDERSTAND ALL THIS IN THE PHOTO OF HIM SITTING IN AN UNMARKED VEHICLE THAT WOULD WHISK HIM OFF TO A NEARBY AIRSTRIP WHERE A WHITE TOWEL WOULD BE DRAPED OVER HIS HEAD AND HE WOULD BE TRUNDLED ABOARD A SMALL JET BOUND FOR MEXICO CITY. EL CHAPO REMAINS A BILLIONAIRE AND IF HE IS NOT EXTRADITED MAYBE HE WILL SOMEDAY HAVE CAUSE TO LOSE THE FACE OF FUCKED. BUT SHOULD HE BY SOME WILD CHANCE MANAGE TO ESCAPE AGAIN THE MARINES ARE SURE TO SET OUT HUNTING FOR HIM ONCE MORE. AND THEY ARE JUST AS SURE NOT TO STOP UNTIL THEY GET HIM. MEANWHILE WE SHOULD AT LEAST OFFER A PRAYER FOR THE LATEST MEXICAN MARINES TO DIE EVEN IF WE DO NOT KNOW THEIR NAMES. OF COURSE IF WE REALLY WANT TO HONOR THEM WE SHOULD STOP BUYING THE DRUGS AND SELLING THE GUNS. ,39759.0

AS I SAT IN LECTURE AFTER LECTURE LISTENING TO A PROFESSOR DRONE ON AND ON ABOUT THE KREBS CYCLE OR THE MICROSCOPIC STRUCTURE OF EACH LAYER OF THE INTESTINAL WALL I WONDERED HOW I COULD POSSIBLY REMEMBER IT ALL. AND AS I DISSECTED MY CADAVER IN GROSS ANATOMY I FELT SUFFOCATED BY THE SHEER VOLUME OF NERVES ARTERIES VEINS AND EVERY DETAILED PART OF EACH ORGAN. DESPITE THE STRESS SOMEHOW I MANAGED TO GET THROUGH IT. MY COLLEAGUES AND I SAT AND LISTENED DILIGENTLY WE STUDIED WE REVIEWED AND WE LEARNED. WE CAME WITH OPEN MINDS TO UNDERSTAND EACH SYSTEM OF THE BODY AND HOW THEY WORKED INDIVIDUALLY AND WITH EACH OTHER. WE DISCOVERED HOW THOSE SYSTEMS CAN BREAK DOWN LEADING TO EVERY PATHOLOGY IMAGINABLE.?Ÿ BUT IMAGINE HOW DIFFERENT THE EDUCATION WOULD HAVE BEEN IF I HAD ALREADY DECIDED THAT I KNEW IT ALL BECAUSE I HAD \RESEARCHED\"" IT ALL BEFORE. ?Ÿ SEVERAL RECENT DISCUSSIONS ON TWITTER WITH ANTIVACCINE ADVOCATES??NONE OF WHOM WERE DOCTORS OR NURSES??MADE ME WONDER. ALL OF THESE FOLKS CLAIMED THEY WERE WELL-RESEARCHED AND THEY HELD VERY STRONG OPINIONS ON VACCINES GENETICALLY-MODIFIED FOODS AND SEVERAL OTHER SCIENTIFIC SUBJECTS. THEY INSISTED VACCINES CAUSE AUTISM AND VARIOUS OTHER DISEASES (THEY DON'T) AND NO MATTER HOW MUCH EVIDENCE I PRESENTED TO THE CONTRARY THEIR OPINIONS WERE SET RIGIDLY IN STONE. ONE EVEN EXPLICITLY TOLD ME THAT NO MATTER HOW MUCH EVIDENCE I SHOWED HER TO THE CONTRARY SHE WOULD?ŸNEVER?ŸCHANGE HER MIND ON THE SUPPOSED EVILS OF VACCINES. THAT GOT ME THINKING: WHAT IF I HAD SHARED THAT CLOSED-MINDEDNESS IN MEDICAL SCHOOL? WHAT KIND OF DOCTOR WOULD I HAVE BECOME IF I HAD REFUSED TO LISTEN TO MY PROFESSORS BECAUSE WHAT THEY TAUGHT ME DIDN'T AGREE WITH MY PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS OF HOW MEDICINE WORKED? FIRST MY INFECTIOUS DISEASE PROFESSOR WOULD LOSE MY CONFIDENCE ENTIRELY. I WOULD REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT INFECTIOUS DISEASES?ŸARE CAUSED BY BACTERIA AND VIRUSES BECAUSE I ONCE?ŸSAW A YOUTUBE VIDEO CLAIMING THAT WE CAN'T SEE THEM SO THEY CAN'T HURT US. SOMEONE COULD TRY TO CLAIM THAT WE CAN SEE BACTERIA UNDER A MICROSCOPE BUT I WOULD COUNTERCLAIM THAT IT COULD BE SOMETHING ELSE LIKE A CONTAMINANT. BESIDES MY MOTHER SAID THAT COLDS ARE CAUSED BY GOING OUTSIDE WITH WET HAIR NOT SOME SILLY VIRUS. ?Ÿ IN MY PHARMACOLOGY COURSE I WOULD HAVE HAD A HARD TIME BELIEVING THE PROFESSOR AS HE DESCRIBED THE VARIOUS ANTIBIOTICS THAT HAVE SAVED MILLIONS OF LIVES CURING A RANGE OF DISEASES FROM PNEUMONIA TO URINARY INFECTIONS TO CANCER. BUT I WOULDN'T BELIEVE HIM BECAUSE MY NATUROPATH TOLD ME TO AVOID THOSE POISONS BECAUSE INFECTIONS CAN BE TREATED JUST AS WELL WITH CRANBERRY JUICE AND HERBS. WHILE LEARNING ABOUT PEDIATRICS I'D BRUSH OFF THE WHOLE MODULE ON VACCINES WHICH HAVE ERADICATED SMALLPOX NEARLY WIPED OUT POLIO AND MEASLES AND HAVE PREVENTED MILLIONS OF DEATHS AND EVEN MORE HOSPITALIZATIONS. BUT I READ IN A FACEBOOK GROUP THAT VACCINES ARE JUST A EUGENICS PROJECT ENGINEERED THE GOVERNMENT IN AN ATTEMPT TO DEPOPULATE THE PLANET. PLUS MY HOMEOPATH TOLD ME THEY CAUSE AUTISM AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES ASTHMA PEANUT ALLERGIES SHAKEN BABY SYNDROME AND SIDS. ?Ÿ I WOULD PROBABLY SKIP MOST OF THE OB/GYN COURSE. DESPITE THE FACT THAT INFANT MORTALITY IS FAR BETTER NOW THAN EVER BEFORE DUE TO ADVANCES IN PRENATAL AND POSTNATAL CARE MY SISTER'S DOULA TOLD ME THAT NATURAL HOME BIRTHS ARE BETTER FOR THE WELLBEING OF THE CHILD AND ALL THOSE NASTY DRUGS COULD BE AVOIDED. I WOULD HAVE TO IGNORE THE FACT THAT MY DAUGHTER WOULD HAVE DIED DURING CHILDBIRTH HAD WE ATTEMPTED A HOME BIRTH DUE TO A PROLAPSED UMBILICAL CORD. I COULD SKIP ONCOLOGY ALTOGETHER THOUGH CANCER CARE HAS ADVANCED DRAMATICALLY OVER THE PAST 50 YEARS DUE TO BETTER CHEMOTHERAPY AND MORE HIGHLY-TARGETED SURGERY AND RADIOTHERAPY. I WOULD HAVE TO DENY THAT CHEMOTHERAPY CAN CURE MANY TYPES OF BLOOD CANCERS BECAUSE MY ACUPUNCTURIST TOLD ME THAT MAINSTREAM MEDICINE IS SUPPRESSING THE REAL CURE FOR CANCER. HE CLAIMS CANCER IS ACTUALLY A FUNGUS AND CAN BE CURED BY ALKALIZING THE BLOOD WITH BAKING SODA. HE TOLD ME ONCOLOGY IS JUST A BIG MONEYMAKING SCHEME FOR DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS THAT HAVE NO INTEREST IN CURING ANYTHING DESPITE EXHAUSTIVE ONGOING RESEARCH EFFORTS AND THOUSANDS OF SCIENTISTS AND DOCTORS DEDICATING THEIR ENTIRE LIVES TO FINDING A CURE.?Ÿ I COULD PROBABLY ALSO SKIP MY FAMILY MEDICINE ROTATION BECAUSE MY CHIROPRACTOR CLAIMS HE IS QUALIFIED TO ACT AS A PRIMARY PHYSICIAN CURING EVERYTHING FROM DIABETES TO EAR INFECTIONS AND ASTHMA WITH AN ADJUSTMENT OR TWO. SURE HE DIDN'T STUDY MEDICINE LIKE A REAL DOCTOR SURE THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT CHIROPRACTIC ??MEDICINE? IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN LOW BACK PAIN AND SURE THE SUBLUXATIONS HE KEEPS TALKING ABOUT DON'T ACTUAL EXIST SO THEY CAN'T BE BLOCKING MY NERVES' ENERGY FLOW WHICH ALSO DOESN'T EXIST. BUT HE SOUNDS CONFIDENT.?Ÿ MY SURGERY ROTATION WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO DISCOUNT. ?ŸI WOULD HAVE TO ADMIT THAT REMOVING AN INFECTED GALL BLADDER IS AN INSTANT CURE BUT I WOULD HAVE FELT OBLIGATED TO TELL THE SURGEON THAT THE PROCEDURE HE JUST PERFORMED WAS UNNECESSARY BECAUSE MY HERBALIST TOLD ME THAT THE PATIENT?ŸCOULD HAVE FLUSHED THE GALLSTONES OUT USING HERBS AND OLIVE OIL.?Ÿ I COULD GO ON BUT THE POINT SHOULD BE FAIRLY EVIDENT. ?Ÿ THE AMOUNT OF PSEUDOSCIENCE FALSE BELIEFS AND UNWARRANTED FEARS SURROUNDING MODERN MEDICINE IS STAGGERING AND AS A PHYSICIAN I AM GROWING INCREASINGLY DISHEARTENED BY THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO CHOOSE TO ESCHEW IT IN FAVOR OF UNTESTED OR UNSCIENTIFIC PRACTICES. MILLIONS OF HOURS OF RESEARCH HAVE PRODUCED THIS SYSTEM OF HEALTH THAT HAS CAUSED LIFE EXPECTANCY AND QUALITY OF LIFE TO BE HIGHER TODAY THAN EVER BEFORE. THERE HAVE BEEN MANY BUMPS IN THE ROAD AND MAKE NO MISTAKE THERE WILL BE MORE. THE RECENT HORRORS IN FRANCE WHEN A CLINICAL DRUG TRIAL KILLED ONE AND HOSPITALIZED OTHERS ARE A TESTAMENT TO THAT. BUT ABANDONING THE BEST AND MOST ADVANCED SYSTEM OF MEDICINE EVER CREATED BECAUSE OF A FEW NOTABLE HICCUPS WOULD BE LIKE ABANDONING AIR TRAVEL ENTIRELY BECAUSE OF A PLANE CRASH.

NONE OF THOSE EFFORTS INCLUDED GRANTING AUTOMATIC AMNESTY TO UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS BUT IT IS CLEAR IN THE MINDS OF HIS FORMER COLLEAGUES THAT FINDING A WAY TO OFFER IMMIGRANTS A WAY TO REMAIN IN THE UNITED STATES AND GAIN LEGAL STATUS WAS CENTRAL TO THE WORK CRUZ DID.

DEFENSE ATTORNEY DEAN STRANG: WE MAY REPRESENT STEVEN AVERY AGAIN,AMERICA??S NEW FAVORITE DEFENSE ATTORNEY IS STILL FIGHTING TO WIN JUSTICE FOR MANITOWOC COUNTY WISCONSIN MAN STEVEN AVERY THE SUBJECT OF NETFLIX??S HIT DOCUSERIES MAKING A MURDERER. SPEAKING WITH THE DAILY BEAST WEDNESDAY NIGHT FROM MILWAUKEE AVERY??S FORMER COUNSEL DEAN STRANG CHALLENGED THE SUPPOSEDLY DAMNING EVIDENCE USED TO CONVICT AVERY IN 2007 FOR THE MURDER OF PHOTOGRAPHER TERESA HALBACH DESPITE THE PLETHORA OF HOLES THAT HAVE OUTRAGED VIEWERS SINCE THE SERIES???ŸDEBUT. ??THIS IS A CASE WHERE I THINK SUBSTANTIAL REAL AND REASONABLE DOUBTS REMAIN ABOUT WHETHER AN INNOCENT MAN GOT CONVICTED? DECLARED STRANG. EARLIER IN THE DAY THE BESPECTACLED ATTORNEY FOUND HIMSELF SPARRING WITH FORMER CALUMET COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY KEN KRATZ ON FOX NEWS AS BOTH MEN ARGUED OVER THE CASE THEY DEBATED IN AND OUT OF COURT A DECADE AGO. AMONG THE CONTESTED ITEMS OF EVIDENCE: THE BLEACH-STAINED JEANS OF AVERY??S THEN 16-YEAR-OLD NEPHEW BRENDAN DASSEY WHO TOLD INVESTIGATORS IN A CONTROVERSIALLY-OBTAINED CONFESSION THAT HE HELPED AVERY RAPE KILL AND BURN HALBACH??S BODY BONES IDENTIFIED AS HALBACH??S FOUND IN AVERY??S BURN PIT??BUT WHICH WERE MOST LIKELY BURNED ELSEWHERE THEN MOVED LEG IRONS AND HANDCUFFS SUPPOSEDLY PURCHASED BY AVERY WHICH WERE NEVER ADMITTED AS EVIDENCE IN AVERY??S TRIAL AND *67 CALLS MADE FROM AVERY TO HALBACH WHO HAD REQUESTED SHE RETURN TO THE AVERY SALVAGE YARD AFTER PREVIOUSLY PHOTOGRAPHING THE FAMILY??S VEHICLE FOR AUTO TRADER MAGAZINE. KRATZ MEANWHILE EMPHASIZED WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS THE CASE??S ??MOST PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE?: THAT INVESTIGATORS FOUND AVERY??S DNA ON THE HOOD LATCH OF HALBACH??S RAV4 WHICH HAD BEEN DISCOVERED ON THE AVERY PROPERTY CONCEALED IN BRANCHES. THE ONLY PROBLEM: NONE OF AVERY??S FINGERPRINTS WERE FOUND IN OR ON THE CAR. SPEAKING WITH THE DAILY BEAST STRANG SCOFFED AT KRATZ??S CONCLUSION. ??MR. KRATZ FEELS AGGRIEVED THAT THE EVIDENCE OF STEVEN??S DNA ON THE HOOD LATCH OR UNDER THE HOOD IS LEFT OUT OF THE FILM. BUT THERE WERE ALSO NO FINGERPRINTS THERE. IF THE DNA TRANSFER WAS FROM HIS SKIN TO THE HOOD WHERE ARE THE FINGERPRINTS? AND YOU HAVE PROBABLY BOTH HANDS ON THE HOOD??POTENTIALLY EIGHT OR TEN FINGERS THAT COULD LEAVE AT LEAST A PARTIAL PRINT.? THE FINGERPRINT ISSUE ALSO RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT ONE OF THE PROSECUTION??S PRIMARY PIECES OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE HE SAYS: AVERY??S BLOOD FOUND SMEARED INSIDE HALBACH??S CAR SUPPOSEDLY FROM A CUT ON HIS FINGER??AND YET NO FINGERPRINTS. ??YOU HAVE A PROBLEM BECAUSE IF HE??S WEARING GLOVES HOW??S HE BLEEDING?? SAID STRANG INCREDULOUS. ??HOW??S HE BLEEDING EXTERNALLY? AND WHERE ARE THE BLOODY GLOVES? THAT BECAME A PROBLEM FOR THE STATE BECAUSE IF HE??S WEARING GLOVES THAT EXPLAINS WHY THERE??S NO FINGERPRINTS. BUT THEN HOW IS THERE BLOOD? IF HE??S NOT WEARING GLOVES BLOOD COULD BE DRIPPING FROM A CUT OKAY. BUT THEN WHY ARE THERE NO FINGERPRINTS?? ??LOOK THERE AREN??T ALWAYS FINGERPRINTS? HE CONTINUED. ??BUT THAT IS A PROBLEM BECAUSE THE STATE THINKS HE DROVE THE CAR. YOU CAN??T DO THAT WITHOUT GRABBING THE STEERING WHEEL. YOU CAN??T TURN THE KEY IN THE IGNITION WITHOUT POTENTIALLY TOUCHING THINGS. YOU CAN??T OPEN A CAR DOOR WITHOUT USING YOUR HANDS AND LEAVING A FINGERPRINT POTENTIALLY.? UNFORTUNATELY FOR AVERY AND CO-COUNSEL JERRY BUTING THE DEFENSE??S FRAMING THEORY??THAT AVERY??S BLOOD HAD BEEN PLANTED INSIDE THE CAR BY OVEREAGER LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TRYING TO ENSURE HIS CONVICTION??WAS STYMIED IN TURN BY FOUR LETTERS: EDTA. ??INITIALLY WE WERE TOLD THAT THE TESTS HADN??T BEEN DONE SINCE THE O.J. SIMPSON TRIAL THAT THEY COULDN??T BE DONE IT WOULD TAKE WEEKS OR MONTHS? SAID STRANG OF THE FBI LABORATORY TEST THE PROSECUTION USED TO ARGUE THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO TAMPERING WITH AVERY??S BLOOD SAMPLE. ??WE HAD TO HAVE A HEARING OUT OF THE JURY??S PRESENCE TO SEE IF IT WAS GOING TO BE ADMISSIBLE? HE SAID. ??WE HAD NO CHANCE AT THAT POINT TO DO INDEPENDENT TESTING OR EVEN TO REACT TERRIBLY WELL TO IT BECAUSE WE??RE BEING HANDED THE REPORT DURING TRIAL AND THEN BOOM??[EXPERT WITNESS] MARK LEBOW IS ON THE STAND THE NEXT MORNING.? AT THE TIME OF AVERY??S TRIAL WISCONSIN STATE LAW DID NOT REQUIRE A DAUBERT TEST TO HOLD EXPERT TESTIMONY TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF SCRUTINY??A STANDARD HE NOTES THAT THE STATE DID BEGIN ENFORCING IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. ??JERRY DID TRY TO SHOW THAT THIS WASN??T EVEN RELEVANT EVIDENCE??THAT IT DIDN??T CLEAR WISCONSIN??S LOW BAR [OF ADMISSIBILITY]? STRANG EXPLAINED. ??BUT THE JUDGE RULED AGAINST US ON THAT.

BUT WISCONSIN CASE LAW REQUIRES DEFENSE TO PROVE MOTIVE IN SAID SUSPECTS WHICH THEY COULD NOT DO. ??THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT ASYMMETRY BECAUSE THE PROSECUTION IN A MURDER CASE AND MOST OTHER CASES IN WISCONSIN NEVER HAS TO PROVE MOTIVE AGAINST THE PERSON ON TRIAL? STRANG SAID. ??BUT STEVEN AVERY DIDN??T HAVE ANY MOTIVE EITHER! HE HAD NOTHING AGAINST [HALBACH]. SHE HADN??T DONE ANYTHING TO HIM. THERE WAS NOTHING TO SUGGEST HE HAD ANY MOTIVE OR SOME REASON TO WANT HER DEAD??AND THE STATE DOESN??T HAVE TO PROVE MOTIVE.? STRANG DECLINED TO IDENTIFY THE FOUR UNNAMED POSSIBLE SUSPECTS HE AND BUTING PROPOSED IN THEIR MOTION OR CONFIRM THAT THEY WERE THE QUARTET AVERY LATER NAMED IN A 2009 APPEAL FILING POINTING TO DASSEY??S BROTHER BOBBY STEPFATHER SCOTT TADYCH AND AVERY??S OWN BROTHERS CHARLES AND EARL. ??I??VE NEVER SEEN THAT FILING? SAID STRANG WHO ADMITS HE ??UNPLUGGED? SOON AFTER THE AVERY CONVICTION CITING THE EXHAUSTING SEVEN-WEEK TRIAL. IT WAS PRUDENT THEN FOR NEW LAWYERS TO TAKE UP AVERY??S CAUSE POST-TRIAL. ??I DON??T WANT TO UNDERMINE HIM? STRANG SAID DECLINING TO COMMENT ON AVERY??S ACCUSATIONS. LIKE EVERY MAKING A MURDERER OBSESSIVE STRANG TOOK NOTE OF THE REVELATION THIS WEEK BY FILMMAKERS MOIRA DEMOS AND LAURA RICCIARDI THAT AN UNIDENTIFIED JUROR BELIEVES AVERY WAS FRAMED AND THAT SAID JUROR FEARED FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY IF THEY DID NOT VOTE TO CONVICT DURING THE 2007 TRIAL. HE DECLINED TO COMMENT ON WHETHER THAT JUROR??S STORY MIGHT HELP SPUR A SECOND CHANCE FOR AVERY.?Ÿ HE CONFIRMED THAT HE AND BUTING HAD CONCERNS ABOUT THE JUROR REVEALED TO BE THE FATHER OF A MANITOWOC COUNTY SHERIFF??S DEPUTY??BUT NOT AS MUCH AS THEY HAD OVER THE SIX POTENTIAL JURORS THEY STRUCK DURING JURY SELECTION EXHAUSTING THEIR MAXIMUM STRIKES.?Ÿ??YOU DON??T PICK A JURY. ALL YOU CAN DO IS UNPICK THE PEOPLE YOU THINK LEAST FIT TO SERVE ON THE JURY? HE EXPLAINED. ??BUT THE CONCERNS ABOUT SIX OTHER POTENTIAL JURORS WERE GREATER.? ALTHOUGH HE VIVIDLY REMEMBERS DETAILS OF THE AVERY CASE STRANG DISCOVERED MATERIAL HE??D NEVER BEFORE SEEN REGARDING THE DASSEY CASE THAT CLEARLY NOW TROUBLE HIM. IN THE DOCUMENTARY HE EXPRESSES GUILT OVER SEEING DASSEY DROWN IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY SEND HIM TO PRISON FOR LIFE. THE TEENAGER??S STORY IS MAKING A MURDERER??S MORE HEARTBREAKING THREAD AS TAPED PHONE CALLS TO HIS MOTHER AND FOOTAGE OF HIS CONFESSIONAL SESSIONS WITH INVESTIGATORS INDICATE HE HAS NO CONCEPT OF HOW BADLY HE??S INCRIMINATING HIMSELF. STRANG WAS PARTICULARLY SHOCKED HE SAYS WATCHING VIDEO OF DASSEY??S SESSION WITH THE INVESTIGATOR HIRED BY HIS OWN DEFENSE. THAT ATTORNEY LEN KACHINSKY HAS SINCE ADMITTED TO SCREWING UP HIS OWN CLIENT??S CASE BY SERVING HIM UP TO FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS WHOSE TAPED INTERROGATIONS OF DASSEY ALSO ALARMED STRANG. ??WHY DO WE ALLOW THE POLICE TO PULL A DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED IMMATURE UNSOPHISTICATED BOY OUT OF CLASS WITHOUT HIS PARENTS AND TAKE HIM OFF AND INTERVIEW HIM IN A MANIPULATIVE PSYCHOLOGICALLY SOPHISTICATED WAY WITH TWO INTELLIGENT ADULT MEN??TEAMED UP AGAINST A DEVELOPMENTALLY DELAYED 16-YEAR-OLD NA??VE BOY?? STRANG DEMANDED. HOW POSSIBLE WAS IT THAT DASSEY AS THE FILM SUGGESTS INSTEAD FABRICATED THE HALBACH RAPE AND MURDER SCENARIO USED TO CONVICT HIM BECAUSE HE??D SEEN THE MOVIE KISS THE GIRLS? ??I THINK THERE??S A GOOD CHANCE OF THAT? SAID STRANG. ??AND THE SIMILARITIES ARE EERIE. THAT??S A MOVIE I THINK THAT WOULD HAVE MADE A PRETTY GRAPHIC IMPRESSION ON SOMEBODY HIS AGE. HE PROBABLY SHOULDN??T HAVE BEEN WATCHING IT.? THERE IS ONE ANSWER FOR THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS AND INCONSISTENCIES THAT PLAGUED BOTH THE AVERY AND DASSEY CASES HE SAYS: REASONABLE DOUBT. ??GUILT HAS TO BE PROVEN BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT. IF THERE IS REASONABLE UNCERTAINTY WE ERR ON THE SIDE OF LIBERTY. THERE IS A QUESTION HERE OF WHETHER THAT STANDARD WAS REALLY FAITHFULLY APPLIED??OR WHETHER THE JURY COULD BECAUSE OF ALL THE AWFUL AND LARGELY INADMISSIBLE PRE-TRIAL INFORMATION THEY HEARD OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN THE MORE THAN A YEAR LEADING UP TO THIS TRIAL.? STRANG HINTED THAT HE AND BUTING MAY RETURN TO AVERY??S SIDE TO FIGHT FOR A NEW TRIAL THAT COULD EXONERATE AVERY??AGAIN. ??JERRY AND I BOTH HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IN TOUCH WITH STEVEN ON AND OFF? SAID STRANG WHO NOW LEADS HIS OWN LAW FIRM STRANG BRADLEY LLC IN MADISON. BUTING IS A PARTNER IN BUTING WILLIAMS & STILLING S.C. AN HOUR AWAY IN BROOKFIELD WISCONSIN. ??IT??S CLEAR THAT HE PROBABLY NEEDS FORMAL LEGAL REPRESENTATION [FOR] THE SPECIFIC CONCRETE THINGS THAT A LAWYER CAN DO IN THE COMING WEEKS AND MONTHS.? ??IT WOULD DEPEND ON WHAT HE WANTS FOR ONE AND TWO WHETHER ANY FUTURE LEGAL STEPS MIGHT INVOLVE EXAMINING WHETHER JERRY AND I DROPPED THE BALL IN SOME WAY??WHETHER WE WERE INADEQUATE OR THE LEGAL TERM IS INEFFECTIVE IN SOME WAY. IF SOME POSSIBLE AVENUE OF RELIEF MIGHT BE RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR PERFORMANCE OR CRITICIZING OUR PERFORMANCE THEN WE SHOULDN??T BE THE ONES TO DO THAT.? ??HE??S NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO PAY ANYBODY? HE ADDED. ??MONEY ISN??T IN THE EQUATION. BUT WHAT IS RIGHT NOW IN OUR EYES IS WHAT??S BEST FOR STEVEN?? STRANG READILY ADMITS HE THINKS IT??S POSSIBLE THAT AVERY IS GUILTY. BUT HE ARGUES ??IF OUR SYSTEM WORKED ON CONVICTING PEOPLE ON MAYBES THEN EVERYBODY COULD PAT THEMSELVES ON THE BACK AND GO OUT AND HAVE A BEER CONVICTING A MAN ON A MAYBE. OUR SYSTEM ISN??T SUPPOSED TO WORK ON CONVICTING PEOPLE ON MAYBES.? ??IN OUR SYSTEM IF WE LIVE THE VALUES WE PROFESS THAT MEANS YOU GET TO KEEP YOUR LIBERTY? HE CONTINUED. ??THAT MEANS YOU DON??T SPEND THE REST OF YOUR LIFE IN A CAGE. COULD HE BE GUILTY? SURE HE COULD. DO I THINK HE WAS PROVEN GUILTY? NO. DO I THINK THERE??S A REAL STRONG CHANCE HE COULD BE INNOCENT? YES. BUT THAT??S JUST ME.

IT WAS THERE AT THE SAME TIME I??M LOOKING AT THEM NOT KNOWING THEY MAY HAVE COMMITTED MURDER? HE SAID. THAT??S WHAT PROSECUTORS SAY HAPPENED ON SEPTEMBER 8 LAST YEAR WHEN NELSON AND DAVIS ROLLED UP TO FLETCHER??S HOME AT 9:30 P.M. A SOURCE CLOSE TO THE INVESTIGATION CONFIRMED THAT NELSON??S NEW GIRLFRIEND WAS EMBROILED IN ??DRAMA? WITH FLETCHER WHO HAD ONLY JUST BEGUN DATING ROLLINS FOR ??A FEW WEEKS? A SOURCE AND FAMILY MEMBERS CONFIRMED. ??SHELLANA HAD AN ISSUE WITH THE NEW GIRLFRIEND BIANCA? THE SOURCE SAID. NELSON THE POLICE REPORT NOTES WAS ??SICK OF IT.? SO NELSON AND DAVIS BARGED INTO FLETCHER??S HOME ??UNANNOUNCED? TO ??CHILL? ACCORDING TO POLICE. INSTEAD NELSON BEGAN QUARRELING WITH HIS EX. BY MOST OF ACCOUNTS (SAVE FOR NELSON??S WHERE HE TOLD COPS HE WAS ??ASLEEP FOR MOST OF THE DAY? AND DENIED ANY INVOLVEMENT) TENSIONS ROSE TO THE POINT WHERE FLETCHER ??THREW A DIAPER AT NELSON WHICH STRUCK HIM? ACCORDING TO THE POLICE REPORT THAT QUOTES NELSON TELLING HIS FRIEND MARK BENSON WHAT HAPPENED. THE COPS HEARD TWO VERSIONS OF WHAT HAPPENED NEXT. ONE WAS FROM BENSON 23 WHO SAID THE ALLEGED MURDERER CONFIDED IN HIM ABOUT THE KILLINGS. THE OTHER WAS HIS FIANC??E DAVIS WHO GAVE HER OWN ACCOUNT OF THE BLOODLETTING. EITHER THE DIAPER-DISGRACED NELSON ROSE UP PULLED OUT A PISTOL AND FATALLY SHOT FLETCHER BEFORE HUNTING DOWN HER BOYFRIEND AND HIS OWN SON OTHERWISE IT WAS DAVIS THAT HAD ACTUALLY KILLED NELSON AND THEN FORCED HER BOYFRIEND TO PROVE HIS LOVE BY RUBBING OUT POTENTIAL EYEWITNESSES IN FLETCHER??S BOYFRIEND AND HIS OWN BOY. BENSON TOLD POLICE THAT NELSON AND DAVIS PICKED HIM UP FOLLOWING THE SLAYINGS AND THAT DAVIS WAS INCONSOLABLE WAILING AS THEY ALL DROVE OFF TOGETHER. WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT NELSON??S HOME THE TWO TALKED ON THE PORCH. NELSON ACCORDING TO THE POLICE REPORT ANNOUNCED ??I WAS THERE AND SAW IT SO OTHER THINGS HAD TO BE DONE.? BENSON SAYS NELSON RIGHT THEN COPPED TO THE WORST OF CRIMES. ??I DID SOMETHING BAD? HE SAID. ??I DID SOMETHING I DON??T THINK I CAN LIVE WITH?? I KILLED THEM. I KILLED THEM.? THE DIAPER TOSS FORCED NELSON TO GO BERSERK. ??I LOST IT? HE TOLD BENSON ACCORDING TO THE POLICE REPORT. WHEN ASKED WHY NELSON SHOT TO DEATH FLETCHER??S BOYFRIEND AND HIS OWN CRYING SON HE ANSWERED POINT BLANK: ??WITNESSES.? APPARENTLY THE REPORT ADDS NELSON FELT THAT JOJO??S CRYING WOULD HAVE DRAWN TOO MUCH ATTENTION. NELSON ALLEGEDLY GAVE THE MURDER WEAPON AND A BAG OF SHELL CASINGS TO BENSON WHO TOLD AUTHORITIES HE GOT RID OF THEM. BENSON ALSO SAID THAT NELSON CHARBROILED HIS AND DAVIS??S BLOOD-STAINED CLOTHES IN A BARBEQUE PIT AND THAT NELSON ??SHOWERED NUMEROUS TIMES AND WASHED HIS HANDS WITH BLEACH.? DAVIS??S VERSION MOSTLY SQUARES WITH BENSON??S SAVE FOR A FEW DETAILS. SHE TOLD POLICE THAT THE VISIT TO FLETCHER??S SEEMED CIVIL THAT THE COUPLE WAS SITTING TOGETHER INSIDE FLETCHER??S LIVING ROOM THAT WORDS GOT HEATED FLETCHER ASKED WHY NELSON BROUGHT ALONG HIS NEW FLAME TO HER HOME. THEN THINGS WENT WRONG. NELSON ORDERED FLETCHER TO SIT DOWN AND ACCORDING TO DAVIS SHE REFUSED. INSTEAD SHE TOSSED A ??HOUSEHOLD ITEM? AT NELSON WHICH MISSED HIM. ??NELSON THEN SHOT [FLETCHER]? ACCORDING TO THE POLICE REPORT. A FROZEN DAVIS WINCED AS SHE WATCHED AS NELSON ??CHECK TO SEE IF SHE WAS DEAD.?DAVIS SAID THEN SHE ??HEARD ANOTHER GUNSHOT? AND TURNED HER HEAD AWAY BEFORE SHE ??THEN RAN OUT OF THE HOUSE.? SHE DIDN??T REMAIN OUTSIDE FOR LONG. NELSON APPARENTLY ORDERED HER BACK INSIDE TO COLLECT ??AS MANY SHELL CASINGS AS SHE COULD FIND.? COPS ULTIMATELY CAUGHT UP TO NELSON AND PROSECUTORS HIT HIM WITH A RAFT OF MURDER CHARGES WHILE DAVIS REMAINED FREE. AS DETECTIVES WERE BUSY TRYING TO BUILD A CASE THAT SHE WAS AT LEAST CULPABLE IN THE TRIPLE HOMICIDE DAVIS REACHED OUT TO PASTOR CLEMONS ABOUT GETTING MARRIED TO THE ACCUSED MURDERER SITTING IN JAIL. ??SHELLANA WAS VERY EMPHATIC? CLEMONS SAID. ??SHE CONTACTED ME SEVERAL TIMES AND AND WANTED TO GET IN THERE AND DO THIS.? THE FIRST CALL HE REMEMBERED DAVIS SIMPLY ASKED IF HE COULD MARRY INCARCERATED COUPLES. ??SHE CALLED AND ASKED ??DO YOU DO WEDDINGS AT THE JACKSON COUNTY DETENTION CENTER??? AND I TOLD HER ??I HAD DONE THEM. WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT AND MEET DOWN THERE. THE CASEWORKER HAS TO APPROVE IT AND THERE??S PLENTY OF TIME TO TALK.??? THE PASTOR IS STRUGGLING WITH THE FALLOUT SINCE THE NEWS HIT THE COUPLE WAS HITCHED. YET HE INSISTS THERE WERE OTHERS IN PLACE TO PUT A HALT THE COUPLE??S WEDDING. ??I DID NOT RESEARCH THEIR BACKGROUNDS THE PEOPLE THAT ISSUE THE LICENSES DO THAT. IT HAS TO GO THROUGH A CASEWORKER IN THE JAIL. IT WENT THROUGH A STRING OF PEOPLE BEFORE I WAS ALLOWED TO COME INTO THAT ENVIRONMENT AND DO THAT.? A MONTH BEFORE NELSON AND DAVIS BECAME HUSBAND AND WIFE JACKSON COUNTY??S PROSECUTING CAUGHT WIND OF THE PENDING NUPTIALS AND RACED TO DEPOSE NELSON BEFORE IT WAS TOO LATE. ??THE STATE HAS NOW LEARNED THAT ON OCTOBER 21 2015 THE DEFENDANT AND MS. DAVIS HAVE FILED AN APPLICATION WITH THE JACKSON COUNTY MISSOURI RECORDER OF DEEDS FOR A MARRIAGE LICENSE? JEAN PETERS BAKER WROTE IN A MOTION. OTHERWISE DAVIS??S ??TESTIMONY IN SOME RESPECTS COULD BECOME UNAVAILABLE TO THE STATE AFTER SHE IS MARRIED TO THE DEFENDANT.? SO THE THE PROSECUTOR PLEADED WITH THE JUDGE TO BE ABLE TO ??PRESERVER [DAVIS??] TESTIMONY BY DEPOSING HER ON VIDEO.? UNFORTUNATELY IT APPEARS THE JUDGE DIDN??T ACT IN TIME TO APPROVE THE MOTION. PROSECUTORS HAVE SINCE FILED ANOTHER MOTION FOR SPECIAL BOND CONDITIONS SO THAT NELSON ??BE ORDERED TO HAVE NO CONTACT? WITH ANY OF THE WITNESSES IN THE CASE INCLUDING HIS WIFE. THE FACT THAT NELSON HAS ??SHOWN A WILLINGNESS TO CONTACT WITNESSES?? HAS BEEN DONE FOR THE PURPOSE OF IMPACTING TESTIMONY.? THE PROSECUTION FACES MULTIPLE OBSTACLES BEFORE THE TRIAL GETS UNDERWAY IN OCTOBER ESPECIALLY REGARDING ANY STATEMENT BY THE FORMER MISS DAVIS AGAINST HER NEW HUSBAND SAYS FRANK BOWMAN A PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI LAW SCHOOL. FIRST SHE MAY HAVE SOME CRIMINAL LIABILITY EVEN IF SHE DIDN??T KILL ANYONE SINCE SHE ALLEGEDLY ADMITTED HELPING COVER UP THE CRIME BOWMAN SAID. THEREFORE SHE CAN AVOID TESTIFYING SIMPLY ON THE BASIS OF HER FIFTH AMENDMENT TO NOT INCRIMINATE HERSELF WHICH WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO HER EVEN IF SHE WASN??T MARRIED TO NELSON. THE PROSECUTION COULD SURMOUNT THIS HURDLE BY ASKING THE JUDGE TO GRANT HER IMMUNITY FROM ANY CHARGES IN THIS CASE BOWMAN ADDED. SECOND MISSOURI HAS A ??SPOUSAL TESTIMONY PRIVILEGE.? THAT MEANS THE NEW MRS. NELSON CAN REFUSE TO TESTIFY AGAINST HER HUSBAND ABOUT THINGS ??THAT HAPPENED DURING THE MARRIAGE BUT ALSO THINGS THAT HAPPENED BEFORE THE MARRIAGE? BOWMAN SAID. LIKE THESE KILLINGS. HOWEVER IF THE PROSECUTORS CAN CONVINCE THE JUDGE THAT THE MARRIAGE WAS A ??SHAM? ENTERED INTO FOR THE PURPOSE OF CREATING A TESTIMONIAL PRIVILEGE THE PRIVILEGE COULD BE RENDERED VOID. ??EVEN IF THAT MARRIAGE HAD ALL THE BELLS AND WHISTLES LIKE A MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE??IF IT WAS MEANT TO BAR HER FROM TESTIFYING THEN THE PRIVILEGE DOESN??T APPLY? BOWMAN SAID. A PARTIAL SOLUTION TO THE PRIVILEGE PROBLEM MAY LIE IN THE FACT THAT MISSOURI LAW VOIDS THE SPOUSAL PRIVILEGE IN CASES WITH VICTIMS UNDER 18 AS TWO OF THE DECEDENTS WERE. BOWMAN SAID USING THIS STATUTE MIGHT REQUIRE TWO DIFFERENT TRIALS ONE FOR THE MINOR VICTIMS AND ONE FOR THE ADULT. FINALLY IF MRS. NELSON CAN??T BE COMPELLED TO TESTIFY AGAINST HER HUSBAND YOU MIGHT THINK THE PROSECUTORS COULD USE THE STATEMENTS SHE MADE TO THE POLICE BEFORE SHE MARRIED AND CLAMMED UP. HOWEVER THOSE STATEMENTS MAY BE BARRED BY THE ??CONFRONTATION CLAUSE? OF THE CONSTITUTION AND RULES AGAINST ??HEARSAY.? BOTH THOSE BARRIERS MIGHT VANISH IF THE JUDGE BELIEVES THE DEFENDANT ENGINEERED HIS ??WIFE??S? SILENCE BY MARRYING HER. HER FATHER ANDREW HILL DOESN??T BELIEVE IT WAS A MATCH MADE IN LOVE. ??I??M TRYING TO GET ANSWERS? HE TOLD THE DAILY BEAST ADDING THAT NELSON CORRUPTED HIS DAUGHTER. ??SHE WAS ON A GOOD TRACK AND THEN SHE FUCKED IT UP. SHE MET HIM AND HE??S A BAD PERSON AND HE HAS A BAD HISTORY. ??I??M LOST RIGHT NOW AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THIS HAPPENED.? STILL GETTING PASS THE LEGAL HURDLES WILL BE EASIER THAN GETTING OVER THE THREE LIVES LOST THAT NIGHT. ??AT THE END OF THE DAY A LOVED ONE IS GONE? ROLLINS?? UNCLE LEE WASHINGTON WHO SAYS HE HELPED RAISE THE PROMISING DANCER TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. ??NO MATTER IF THIS GUY AND HIS WOMAN GOES BACK IN THE JAIL FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES I DON??T GET ANY SATISFACTION BECAUSE SHANNON??S LIFE WAS TAKEN.? THE FAMILY HAS BEEN ??PITCHING IN? TO RAISE ROLLINS??S SON WHO IS NOW FATHERLESS. THE FACT THAT HIS NEPHEW??S ALLEGED KILLERS ARE NOW MARRIED FURTHER SALTS THE WOUND TORN OPEN BY BULLETS. ??THE ONLY WAY WE GET JUSTICE IS IF WE KILL THAT MOTHERFUCKER OURSELVES AND THAT AIN??T GOING TO HAPPEN? HE SAID. ??AND IF THEY DUPE THE SYSTEM IT REALLY DOESN??T MATTER BECAUSE WE STILL LOST SHANNON. WE STILL HAVE A GREAT KID GONE THAT HAS A CHILD LEFT HERE WITHOUT A FATHER.? THE FUNERAL WAS ESPECIALLY TOUGH HIS UNCLE SAID. ??WE BURIED HIM ON HIS 19TH BIRTHDAY.? WASHINGTON REMEMBERED OF ROLLINS AS A HANDSOME HEARTBREAKER. ??SHANNON HAD A GREAT SMILE AND VERY LIKEABLE AND WAS TOO SMART FOR HIS OWN GOOD? HE SAID.??SHANNON HAD SO MANY GIRLS IT WAS RIDICULOUS.

CORE CURRICULUMS ARE A WAY FOR UNIVERSITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE ON CAMPUS ABSORBS A COMMON SET OF SKILLS AND VALUES DEEMED FUNDAMENTAL TO A LIBERAL ARTS EDUCATION??THEY OFTEN INCLUDE BASIC INSTRUCTION IN WRITING HISTORY AND MATHEMATICAL REASONING FOR INSTANCE. AMERICAN PLANS TO MODERNIZE ITS CURRICULUM BY 2017 AND HAS CONVENED A TASK FORCE OF PROFESSORS TO COMPLETE THE PROCESS. A DRAFT OF THEIR PROPOSED CURRICULUM IS AVAILABLE HERE. UNDER THE PROPOSAL THE NEW CORE CURRICULUM WOULD REQUIRE STUDENTS TO ENROLL IN SEVERAL WORRISOME COURSES THAT THE CATO INSTITUTE??S WALTER OLSON HAS ASTUTELY LABELLED?Ÿ??OPPRESSION STUDIES.? THE TASK FORCE CALLS THEM ??COMPLEX PROBLEMS? AND ??AU EXPERIENCE? BUT ??OPPRESSION STUDIES? IS CERTAINLY THE MORE FITTING NAME. FROM THE DRAFT: ALTHOUGH MANY COMPLEX PROBLEMS COURSES WILL DRAW HEAVILY ON THE SOCIAL SCIENCES (IN THE ANALYSIS OF SUCH ISSUES AS INEQUALITY SOCIAL VIOLENCE AND HEALTH CARE ACCESS) OTHERS WILL BE GROUNDED IN THE SCIENCES (CLIMATE CHANGE DEMENTIA) OR ARTS AND HUMANITIES (ART AND POLITICS POST-COLONIAL EXPRESSION). THE AU EXPERIENCE COURSES ARE SIMILARLY ONE-NOTE AND WILL PAY ??SPECIAL ATTENTION TO ISSUES OF DIVERSITY INCLUSION AND COMMUNITY.? READING ASSIGNMENTS ACCORDING TO THE DRAFT WILL FOCUS ON ??OPPRESSION AND RESISTANCE? ??HISTORICAL VIOLENCE SUCH AS THE EARLY SLAVE TRADE AND GENOCIDAL CONQUESTS? AND THE ??EXPERIENCES OF MARGINALIZED GROUPS AND STRUGGLES FOR HUMAN RIGHTS.? FOR GOOD MEASURE COURSE MATERIALS WILL FIXATE ON ??HOW ENTRENCHED SYSTEMS OF INEQUALITY MARGINALIZE SOME GROUPS AND PRIVILEGE OTHERS.? THIS IS NOT TO SAY THESE AREN??T IMPORTANT AND FASCINATING TOPICS??THEY ARE AND STUDENTS SHOULD STUDY THEM IF THEY WANT TO. BUT IT??S ONE THING TO MAKE THESE COURSES AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS WHO HAVE AN INTEREST IN EXPLICITLY LEFT-WING TOPICS. IT??S QUITE ANOTHER TO REQUIRE THE STUDY OF A SPECIFIC VIEWPOINT AND SUBJUGATE ALL OTHER ACADEMIC CONCERNS. AND THAT??S JUST THE BEGINNING. THE PROPOSAL ALSO CALLS FOR A DRAMATIC??AND MILDLY TERRIFYING??TRANSFORMATION OF LIFE IN THE RESIDENCE HALLS. NO LONGER WILL STUDENTS SHACK UP TOGETHER AT RANDOM: INSTEAD AU WOULD ASSIGN STUDENTS TO PARTICULAR HOUSING BASED ON WHICH ??OPPRESSION STUDIES? COURSES THEY ARE TAKING. THE POINT OF THIS CHANGE IS TO FORCE STUDENTS TO GRAPPLE WITH THESE SUBJECTS IN THEIR FREE TIME AS WELL AS THEIR CLASS TIME??IN OTHER WORDS TO MOVE THE OPPRESSION FROM THE CLASSROOM TO THE DORM ROOM. HOW HORRIBLE DOES THAT SOUND? IT GETS WORSE. ??UPPER CLASS PEER MENTORS? ACCORDING TO THE DRAFT WILL BE ASSIGNED TO THESE GROUPS OF STUDENTS. THE DRAFT DESCRIBES THEM AS ??SUPPORT TEAMS? BUT IT??S EASY TO IMAGINE THEM MORPHING INTO SOME KIND OF SOCIAL JUSTICE ENFORCERS INSTEAD. THIS PLAN IF APPROVED WOULD ADD AU TO THE LIST OF CAMPUSES ATTEMPTING TO TURN ITS RESIDENCE HALLS INTO RE-EDUCATION CAMPS. THE MOST FAMOUS EXAMPLE WAS THE UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE WHICH PREVIOUSLY REQUIRED STUDENTS TO SUBMIT TO A RIGOROUS AND INTRUSIVE IDEOLOGICAL TRAINING PROGRAM WITH THE EXPLICIT GOAL OF CHANGING THEIR ??INCORRECT? BELIEFS AND TRANSFORMING THEM INTO EAGER LEFTIST ACTIVISTS. THE ALMOST UNBELIEVABLY ORWELLIAN PROGRAM WAS CENTERED ON DORM LIFE WHERE RESIDENTIAL ADVISORS ROUTINELY INTERROGATED STUDENTS (ON THE ORDERS OF THE CAMPUS HOUSING DEPARTMENT) ABOUT EVERYTHING FROM THEIR SEX LIVES TO THEIR POLITICAL BELIEFS.?Ÿ THE RAS KEPT FILES ON INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS THOSE WHO DIDN??T SHOW ENOUGH PROGRESS TOWARD REFORMING THEIR PROBLEMATIC VIEWS WERE PUBLICLY SHAMED AT MANDATORY MEETINGS AND EVEN DISCIPLINED. ONLY THE EVENTUAL INVOLVEMENT OF THE FOUNDATION FOR INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS IN EDUCATION??WHICH LAUNCHED AN ADVOCACY CAMPAIGN THAT PERSUADED DELAWARE TO ABOLISH THE INDOCTRINATION PROGRAM??LIBERATED THE STUDENTS FROM ENFORCED CONFORMITY. AU WOULD BE WISE TO ESCHEW THE PATH OF DELAWARE. IT??S PERFECTLY FINE TO CHALLENGE STUDENTS?? BELIEFS AND BIASES??IN FACT IT??S THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF GOING TO COLLEGE IN THE FIRST PLACE??BUT UNIVERSITIES SHOULD LEAVE THE PROSELYTIZING TO THE PROFESSORS NOT THE RESIDENCE HALL POLICE. BUT PERHAPS AMERICAN UNIVERSITY IS SIMPLY LIVING UP TO ITS NAME. AFTER ALL IT??S BECOME CLEAR IN RECENT MONTHS THAT AMERICAN COLLEGE CAMPUSES ARE IN THE THROES OF WHAT FORMER HARVARD UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT LARRY SUMMERS RECENTLY DESCRIBED?ŸAS ??CREEPING TOTALITARIANISM IN TERMS OF WHAT KIND OF IDEAS ARE ACCEPTABLE AND DEBATABLE ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES.? A LOT OF LEFT-LEANING STUDENTS HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT THEY DON??T WANT TO BE BOTHERED ANYMORE BY IDEAS THAT OFFEND THEM AND A LOT OF CAMPUS ADMINISTRATORS HAVE DECIDED TO MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO SHELTER THEM FROM DISSENTING POINTS OF VIEW. PARADOXICALLY THESE EFFORTS ARE ALWAYS UNDERTAKEN IN THE NAME OF INCLUSION TOLERANCE AND DIVERSITY. BUT IF AU REQUIRES ALL STUDENTS TO STUDY A SINGLE POINT OF VIEW AND ORGANIZES THEIR DORMITORIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH IDEOLOGICAL CONFORMITY HOW CAN ANYONE SAY THE UNIVERSITY IS ACTUALLY INCLUSIVE OR TOLERANT TOWARD DISSENTERS? HOW CAN ANYONE SAY THAT IT ACTUALLY PRIZES DIVERSITY? HOW CAN ANYONE SAY THAT STUDENTS ARE FREE IN ANY MEANINGFUL SENSE TO SAY AND THINK AND DO WHAT THEY WANT?

WHAT MESSAGE DOES TURNER??S STORY OF VIOLENT RIGHTEOUS RESISTANCE SEND TO TODAY??S AMERICA? ??IF IT SENDS A MESSAGE IT SAYS ??USE THE TOOLS THAT YOU HAVE??? PARKER ANSWERED. ??NAT TURNER ALL HE HAD WERE AXES AND BROOM HANDLES. HE DIDN??T HAVE GUNS. HE DIDN??T HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASSEMBLY. HE DIDN??T HAVE THE RIGHT TO LEAVE HIS PLANTATION. HE DIDN??T CONTROL HIS OWN BODY. HE HAD TOOLS IN FRONT OF HIM AND HE TRIED TO DEAL WITH EVIL AND THE INJUSTICE AROUND HIM IN THE ONLY WAY THAT WAS AVAILABLE TO HIM. THE REALITY IS IF NAT TURNER HAD TWITTER AND FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM THEN MAYBE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A DIFFERENT TYPE OF REVOLUTION.

AS COLBERT PROMISED THE CONVERSATION GOT SIGNIFICANTLY MORE POLITICAL AFTER A COMMERCIAL BREAK. ??ARE YOU EVER UPSET THAT THERE IS ANOTHER DONALD OUT THERE WHO IS EVEN MORE FAMOUS THAN YOU FOR NEVER APOLOGIZING FOR ANYTHING?? HE ASKED. THE FORMER SECRETARY OF DEFENSE SAID HE HAS NEVER MET DONALD TRUMP AND DOESN??T QUITE UNDERSTAND HOW OR WHY HE IS ??TOUCHING A NERVE? WITH SO MANY PEOPLE. THINGS GOT INCREASINGLY MORE TENSE HOWEVER AS COLBERT MOVED ON TO THE DECISION TO GO TO WAR WITH IRAQ IN 2003 ASKING IF THE RISE OF ISIS WAS EVER EVEN CONSIDERED BY THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION AS A ??WORST-CASE SCENARIO.? ??I THINK THE DISORDER IN THE ENTIRE REGION AND THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE SUNNIS AND THE SHIA IS SOMETHING THAT GENERALLY PEOPLE HAD NOT ANTICIPATED? RUMSFELD ANSWERED. ??ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU THINK WHAT EISENHOWER SAID HE SAID ??THE PLAN IS NOTHING PLANNING IS EVERYTHING.?? THE POINT BEING THAT ANYTHING CHANGES WITH FIRST CONTACT WITH A PROBLEM.? NOTING THAT THE TOP TWO CANDIDATES ON EITHER SIDE OF THE AISLE ALL THINK THAT GOING INTO IRAQ WAS NOT THE RIGHT CHOICE TO MAKE COLBERT ASKED ??DO YOU HAVE ANY REFLECTION ON THE DECISION TO GO INTO IRAQ? DO YOU STILL THINK IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO 12 YEARS LATER?? RUMSFELD RETURNED TO HIS OLD DEFENSE OF THE INTELLIGENCE ON CHEMICAL WEAPONS. HE DID ADMIT THAT ??IN RETROSPECT THEY DIDN'T FIND LARGE CACHES OF CHEMICAL OR BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS? BUT ADDED THAT ??THE U.N. INSPECTOR DID SAY THEY HAD THE FACILITIES STILL THERE THE PEOPLE WERE STILL THERE WHO HAD THE CAPABILITY AND THE PRECURSORS TO THESE WEAPONS WERE STILL THERE.? EARLIER THIS YEAR JEB BUSH WAS TRIPPED UP BY A QUESTION FROM MEGYN KELLY WHO ASKED IF ??KNOWING WHAT WE KNOW NOW? HE WOULD HAVE AUTHORIZED THE INVASION OF IRAQ.

WAIT YOU DON??T? WELL REFRAIN FROM TELLING THAT TO MICHAEL BAY THE MAESTRO OF SUPERSIZED SLAM-BANG SPECTACLES WHO ENLISTED KRASINSKI TO BE THE BUFF SCRUFFY PROTAGONIST OF 13 HOURS: THE SECRET SOLDIERS OF BENGHAZI. TASKED WITH HELPING DEFEND THE U.S. DIPLOMATIC COMPOUND (AS WELL AS A NEARBY INTELLIGENCE FACILITY) IN BENGHAZI LIBYA AFTER AN ATTACK BY ISLAMIC TERRORISTS ON SEPTEMBER 11 2012 KRASINSKI??S MILITARY CONTRACTOR??AND FORMER AMERICAN SPECIAL FORCES STUD??STANDS TALL IN THE FACE OF INSURMOUNTABLE ODDS TAKING UP ARMS WITH NOBLE COURAGE IN ORDER TO MOW DOWN HORDES OF ENEMIES THAT SEEK HIS (AND THE U.S. AMBASSADOR??S) HEAD. YOU KNOW JUST LIKE JIM FROM THE OFFICE. KRASINSKI??S PARTICIPATION IN SUCH A RAH-RAH GUNFIRE-AND-EXPLOSIONS BAY-GASM SEEMS AT FIRST BLUSH TO BE ONE OF THE MORE UNLIKELY CASTING DECISIONS IN RECENT MEMORY??UNTIL THAT IS ONE REMEMBERS THAT LAST YEAR??S BIGGEST FILM JURASSIC WORLD AS WELL AS 2013??S SMASH GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY WERE HEADLINED BY THAT CHUBBY DOOFUS FROM NBC??S MODELED-AFTER-??THE-OFFICE HIT PARKS AND RECREATION CHRIS PRATT. THIS DOESN??T EXACTLY MEAN THAT NBC COMEDIES ARE THE NEW BREEDING GROUND FOR 21ST CENTURY BADASSES BUT IT DOES UNDERLINE THAT WE??RE NOW FULLY AND PERHAPS IRREVOCABLY IN THE AGE OF THE EVERYMAN ACTION HERO. THE NEW WORLD ORDER OF NON-STEROIDAL HE-MEN HAS BEEN DAWNING FOR SOME TIME WITH ONLY DWAYNE JOHNSON OPPOSING ITS TOTAL HOLLYWOOD DOMINATION. THE ROCK??S SUPERSTARDOM IS AT THIS POINT UNDENIABLE YET HE??S THE ANOMALY IN A LANDSCAPE THAT??S MOSTLY DONE AWAY WITH THE VISIONS OF MR. UNIVERSE-PROPORTIONED MASCULINITY WHICH DURING THE ??80S AND ??90S DOMINATED THE BIG SCREEN. LONG GONE IS THE HEGEMONY OF ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER SYLVESTER STALLONE JEAN-CLAUDE VAN DAMME AND THE REST OF THEIR DIESEL ILK ALL OF WHOSE RESPECTIVE RECENT ATTEMPTS AT THROWBACK-COMEBACKS??FROM STALLONE??S EXPENDABLES FRANCHISE TO HIS AND SCHWARZENEGGER??S 2013 TEAM-UP ESCAPE PLAN TO VAN DAMME??S UNDERRATED DIRECT-TO-VIDEO UNIVERSAL SOLDIER SEQUELS??HAVE BEEN RELEGATED TO NICHE ENTERTAINMENTS. THAT TIMES CHANGE IS OF COURSE UNDENIABLE. HOWEVER WHAT??S SURPRISING IS THAT THESE BYGONE MARQUEE STARS HAVE BEEN SUCCEEDED NOT BY SIMILAR LARGER-THAN-LIFE FIGURES??WHO THE ROCK NOTWITHSTANDING SIMPLY DON??T EXIST IN HOLLYWOOD TODAY??BUT INSTEAD BY AVERAGE JOES WHO??VE PACKED ON JUST ENOUGH MUSCLE TO HELP THEM PASS AS TOUGH GUYS. CALL IT THE WILL SMITH (OR FOR THAT MATTER BRUCE WILLIS) EFFECT: THE IDEA THAT ACTION HEROES CAN BE MOLDED OUT OF GOOD-LOOKING SEXUALLY APPEALING COMEDIC ACTORS. IN BOTH SMITH AND WILLIS?? CASES THEY HELPED USHER OUT??SLOWLY BUT CONCLUSIVELY??THEIR BODYBUILDING-LOVING CONTEMPORARIES (AND PREDECESSORS) BY LACING THEIR BRAWN FEATS OF DERRING-DO WITH WRY SARCASM AND ROMANTIC APPEAL. WHAT MAKES THE DIE HARD AND BAD BOYS SERIES?? WORK IS THAT THEY FEATURE AT THEIR CENTER CHARISMATIC MEN WHO ARE AS AMUSING AS THEY ARE IMPOSING CAPABLE OF EXTRAORDINARY THINGS AND ALSO SMART ENOUGH TO SELF-DEPRECATINGLY SMIRK AT THEIR SUPERHEROISM. MOREOVER LIKE HARRISON FORD IN THE INDIANA JONES FILMS THEY??RE THE TYPES OF GUYS THAT WOMEN MIGHT ACTUALLY WANT TO BED??SOMETHING THAT COULD NEVER TRULY BE SAID ABOUT SCHWARZENEGGER OR STALLONE NEITHER OF WHOM (SAVE FOR THE ORIGINAL ROCKY) EVER SHARED A ROMANTIC ON-SCREEN MOMENT WITH A WOMAN THAT DIDN??T FEEL UNCOMFORTABLY FORCED AND ARTIFICIAL. THIS ISN??T TO CLAIM THAT KRASINSKI PRATT CHRIS PINE (STAR TREK) OR THE LEGION OF FELLAS WHO POPULATE MARVEL??S VARIOUS COMIC BOOK PROPERTIES ARE IN QUITE THE SAME CLASS AS WILLIS AND SMITH (THOUGH ROBERT DOWNEY JR. COMES CLOSEST). RATHER IT??S TO ARGUE THAT CONTEMPORARY ACTION CINEMA HAS DONE AWAY WITH ITS OLD-SCHOOL MODEL OF CARTOONISH BICEPS AND MACHO ATTITUDE BECAUSE IT DISCOVERED THAT A MORE RELATABLE FUNNY SELF-CONSCIOUS ASS-KICKER IS IN THE LONG RUN A MORE SUSTAINABLE ONE. SCHWARZENEGGER AND STALLONE??S HABIT OF SLAUGHTERING VILLAINS AND THEN DELIVERING POST-KILL QUIPS WAS AT THE TIME A NOVEL WINK-WINK FORMULA FOR SUCCESS. YET IT SOON DEVOLVED INTO A PARODY OF ITSELF (PEAKING WITH 1993??S THE LAST ACTION HERO) LARGELY BECAUSE ACTING LIKE A MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE CHARACTER AFFORDED SO FEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR VARIETY THAT IT WAS DESTINED TO BECOME MONOTONOUS. ON THE OTHER HAND BEING CHARMING AND DASHING WITH A SENSE OF HUMOR IS AN ETERNAL RECIPE FOR MOVIE LONGEVITY. FURTHER HELPING FUNNYMEN??S ACTION ASCENDENCY HAVE BEEN THE RISE OF TWO RELATED MODERN CINEMATIC TECHNIQUES. THE FIRST IS MICHAEL BAY??S PIONEERING USE OF CAR COMMERCIAL-GLOSSY CINEMATOGRAPHY FIREBALL-HEAVY SET PIECES AND FRANTIC EDITING??A STYLE SO OFTEN APED THAT IT??S BEEN GIVEN A NAME (??CHAOS CINEMA?) AND NOW DOMINATES THE GENRE. BY EMPLOYING BAY??S FILMMAKING METHODS AN ACTOR??ANY ACTOR??CAN BE MADE TO LOOK LIKE A DEADLY HUMAN WEAPON PRECISELY BECAUSE THEY MASK STARS?? PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS THROUGH INCOHERENT SOUND-AND-FURY VISUALS THAT MERELY SUGGEST ??ACTION.? IT??S HOW BAY MADE WILL SMITH AND MARTIN LAWRENCE (MARTIN LAWRENCE!) CREDIBLE SUPER-COPS IN BAD BOYS. IT??S HOW HE GOT AWAY WITH CASTING THE AT-THAT-POINT-COMEDY-ORIENTED NICOLAS CAGE IN THE ROCK. IT??S HOW HE MANAGED TO CONVINCE STUDIO EXECS TO LET FAR-FROM-INTIMIDATING EWAN MCGREGOR COMMAND THE ISLAND. AND IT??S NOW HOW HE GOT KRASINSKI INTO 13 HOURS. ALONGSIDE BAY??S FRANTIC AESTHETICS THE RISE OF CG HAS ALSO ALLOWED THE CHRIS PRATTS AND CHRIS EVANSES OF THE WORLD TO SEIZE THE ACTION THRONE. WHILE STALLONE HIMSELF BLAMES 1989??S BATMAN AS THE TURNING POINT IN THE GENRE??S PARADIGM SHIFT AWAY FROM IMPRESSIVE PHYSIQUES AND TOWARD SPECIAL-EFFECTS THAT TRANSITION WAS MORE RADICALLY PROMPTED BY 1993??S JURASSIC PARK AND AGAIN WITH 2002??S SPIDER-MAN IN WHICH TOBEY MAGUIRE PLAYED THE MILD-MANNERED PETER PARKER AND A TEAM OF TECH WIZARDS CREATED ON A COMPUTER HIS MASKED WEB-SLINGING ALTER-EGO SPIDER-MAN. SPIDER-MAN SHOWED THAT HUMANS WERE NO LONGER NEEDED TO EVEN DO THEIR OWN STUNTS??A LESSON SUBSEQUENTLY RECONFIRMED TO THE TUNE OF BILLIONS BY 2008??S IRON MAN WHICH REQUIRED DOWNEY JR. TO ONLY BE A FACE IN A CG-CRAFTED SUIT OF ARMOR AS WELL AS BY THE COUNTLESS SUPERHERO SAGAS THAT HAVE FOLLOWED IN ITS WAKE INCLUDING ROM-COM CHARMER PAUL RUDD??S RECENT ASS-KICKING TURN AS ANT-MAN. IN A DIGITIZED ENVIRONMENT THAT BARELY REQUIRES AN ACTOR TO BE PRESENT FOR A MOVIE??S SIGNATURE MOMENTS??AS EVIDENCED BY MARK RUFFALO WHO PLAYS THE HULK IN THE AVENGERS MOVIES WITHOUT EVER HAVING TO THROW A HAYMAKER MUCH LESS TURN GREEN??HOLLYWOOD NO LONGER SEES A NEED TO POPULATE ITS ACTION TENTPOLES WITH GUYS WHO SPEND HALF THEIR LIVES IN THE GYM. IN ONE SENSE THAT??S A TREMENDOUS LOSS FOR THE GENRE AS FLASHY DECEPTIVE FILMMAKING BECOMES A SUBSTITUTE FOR FLESH-AND-BLOOD MEN DOING AMAZING THINGS (HENCE WHY SEEING TOM CRUISE LITERALLY HANG OFF A PLANE IN LAST SUMMER??S AWESOME MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE ?? ROGUE NATION WAS SUCH A THRILL). BUT IT ALSO MEANS THAT TODAY??S GUY??S-GUY EFFORTS ARE ABLE TO INFUSE THEIR ACTION WITH THE SORT OF WITTY SEXY PERSONALITY THAT WAS SO OFTEN MISSING FROM THEIR BRAWNY PREDECESSORS. AS 13 HOURS MAKES CLEAR: JIM THE SARCASTIC CO-WORKER GOOD GUY IS DEAD LONG LIVE JIM THE SARCASTIC KILL-??EM-ALL GOOD GUY. ,9140.0

1397,10430399.0,2016-01-30T05:00:00+00:00,HOW RUSSIA BEAT THE U.S. TO THE MOON,TYPICAL SPACE RACE NARRATIVES FOCUS ON THE COMPETITION BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET UNION TO LAND A MAN ON THE MOON IN THE 1960S. BUT THIS IS ONLY PART OF THE STORY. BEHIND THIS RACE TO PUT BOOT PRINTS IN THE LUNAR REGOLITH WAS A RACE BETWEEN NATIONS TO BE THE FIRST TO REACH UNDERSTAND AND EXPLORE THE MOON WITH ROBOTIC PROBES ALL DONE AT A TIME WHEN SPACEFLIGHT WAS FIRMLY IN ITS INFANCY. IN THIS RACE THE SOVIET UNION WON WHEN LUNA 9 BECAME THE FIRST SPACECRAFT TO SUCCESSFULLY SOFT LAND ON THE MOON ON JANUARY 31 1966. BUT THE PATH WAS ANYTHING BUT STRAIGHTFORWARD. THE IDEA OF A LUNAR MISSION WASN??T BORN WITH PRESIDENT KENNEDY??S 1961 COMMITMENT TO THE UNITED STATES TO LAND A MAN ON THE MOON BY THE END OF THE DECADE. AT LEAST AS EARLY AS THE MID 19TH CENTURY THE IDEA STARTED TO MOVE FROM THE REALM OF SCIENCE FICTION TO SCIENCE FACT. JULES VERNE??S ??FROM THE EARTH TO THE MOON? GAVE READERS A LUNAR MISSION STEEPED IN RESEARCH. THE BOOK INSPIRED A GENERATION OF SCIENTISTS TO TURN DREAMS OF SPACEFLIGHT INTO REALITY MOST NOTABLY AUSTRIAN HERMANN OBERTH WHOSE PIONEERING WORK ON LIQUID FUELED ROCKETS INSPIRED WERNHER VON BRAUN WHO DEVELOPED THE SATURN V ROCKET THAT TOOK ASTRONAUTS TO THE MOON IN THE 1960S. NOT UNTIL 1958 DID THE PROSPECT OF GOING TO THE MOON BECOME A REALITY. MONTHS BEFORE CREATING THE NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION PRESIDENT EISENHOWER GAVE BOTH THE U.S. AIR FORCE AND THE U.S. ARMY PERMISSION TO LAUNCH TWO LUNAR PROBES EACH. THESE PROBES WERE EVENTUALLY CHRISTENED PIONEER AND WERE DESIGNED WITH THE INTENTION OF TAKING PICTURES AND COLLECTING DATA THROUGHOUT THEIR FLIGHTS TO THE MOON. THE AIR FORCE CHOSE THE TRW COMPANY TO BUILD ITS PROBES PIONEERS 1 AND 2 WHILE THE ARMY CHOSE JPL TO BUILD ITS PIONEERS 3 AND 4. BUT THE UNITED STATES WASN'T ALONE IN EMBARKING ON THIS LUNAR CHALLENGE. AROUND THE SAME TIME IN THE SPRING OF 1958 THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT APPROVED A PROGRAM FOR LUNAR EXPLORATION CALLED LUNA FOR THE RUSSIAN WORD FOR ??MOON? (THOUGH KNOWN SOMETIMES AS EITHER LUNIK OR LUNNIK IN THE WESTERN MEDIA). LIKE ITS AMERICAN COUNTERPART LUNA FOCUSSED ON EXPLORING THE MOON AND ITS ENVIRONMENT WITH A SERIES OF ROBOTIC PROBES. WHERE THE AMERICAN PROGRAM SOURCED ITS PROBES FROM DIFFERENT CONTRACTORS THE SOVIET PROGRAM DEVELOPED DIFFERENT INITIAL PROBES EACH OF WHICH HAD A UNIQUE GOAL. GOING BY THEIR INTERNAL DESIGNATIONS YE-1 WAS DESIGNED FOR LUNAR IMPACT YE-2 AND YE-3 WERE INTENDED TO IMAGE THE MOON??S FARSIDE AND YE-4 WAS A SPACECRAFT TO IMPACT THE MOON WITH A NUCLEAR EXPLOSION. THE UNITED STATES WAS THE FIRST NATION TO LAUNCH A MISSION TO THE MOON. ABLE 1 LATER RENAMED PIONEER 0 LAUNCHED ON AUGUST 17 1958. THE MISSION ENDED WHEN THE THOR LAUNCH VEHICLE EXPLODED JUST 77 SECONDS AFTER LAUNCH DESTROYING THE SPACECRAFT AT THE SAME TIME. A LITTLE OVER A MONTH LATER THE SOVIET UNION LAUNCHED HISTORY??S SECOND LUNAR MISSION. A FIRST GENERATION YE-1 LUNA SPACECRAFT IT ALSO FAILED TO REACH ORBIT. LONGITUDINAL VIBRATIONS ALSO KNOWN AS POGO SHOOK THE ROCKET HARD ENOUGH TO BREAK IT APART IN FLIGHT. THE FINAL MONTHS OF 1958 SAW ALTERNATING LAUNCHES BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES ALL OF WHICH EXPERIENCED CATASTROPHIC LAUNCH FAILURES. FOR THE AMERICANS THESE WERE PIONEERS 1 2 AND 3. FOR THE SOVIETS THE LOSSES WERE LUNA 1958A B AND C MISSIONS WERE ONLY GIVEN SEQUENTIAL NUMERICAL DESIGNATIONS IF THEY WERE SUCCESSFUL. SUCCESS FINALLY CAME RIGHT AT THE START OF 1959 WITH LUNA 1. ANOTHER YE-1 DESIGN THE SPHERICAL SPACECRAFT REACHED THE MOON 34 HOURS AFTER LAUNCH. ITS ONBOARD INSTRUMENTS GATHERED DATA REVEALING FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT THE MOON HAD NO MAGNETIC FIELD AND THAT A STRONG FLOW OF IONIZED PLASMA FROM THE SUN THE SO-CALLED SOLAR WIND FLOWS THROUGH SPACE. AFTER FLYING PAST THE MOON LUNA 4 SETTLED INTO A HELIOCENTRIC ORBIT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN EARTH AND MARS. TWO MONTHS LATER THE UNITED STATES FOLLOWED SUIT WITH A FLYBY MISSION OF ITS OWN THE JPL-BUILT PIONEER 4 PROBE WHICH PASSED BY THE MOON TOO FAR AWAY TO TAKE GOOD IMAGES. WITH ONE SUCCESS UNDER ITS BELT BOTH NATIONS PRESSED ON WITH LUNAR MISSION AND RACKED UP A FAIR NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL FAILURES. BUT THEY ALSO BEGAN TO TAKE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. AS LATER PIONEER FLIGHTS WENT TOWARDS OUR NEIGHBORING PLANETS OF MARS AND VENUS NASA INITIATED A NEW LUNAR IMPACT PROGRAM CALLED RANGER. SCIENCE GOALS WERE REMOVED WITH EVERY SUBSEQUENT FAILURE AND THE PROGRAM GOAL BECAME RETURNING A PICTURE OF THE MOON WHICH RANGER 7 MANAGED ON JULY 31 1964. BUT SADLY THIS WAS HARDLY AN EXCITING FIRST. ON OCTOBER 4 1959 THE SOVIETS LAUNCHED A YE-2 SPACECRAFT ON THE LUNA 3 MISSION AND THREE DAYS LATER IT RETURNED THE FIRST EVER IMAGES OF THE MOON??S UNSEEN FARSIDE. THE EARLY AND MID-1960S SAW THE SOVIET UNION AND UNITED STATES FOCUS MORE ENERGY ON PLANETARY MISSIONS THAN CONTINUED LUNAR FLIGHTS THOUGH NEITHER COMPLETELY ABANDONED MISSIONS TO THE MOON. ON THE HEELS OF THE RANGER PROGRAM NASA INCEPTED ANOTHER PROGRAM CALLED SURVEYOR. DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE APOLLO PROGRAM THE GOAL FOR SURVEYOR WAS TO SOFT LAND PROBES ON THE MOON??S SURFACE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE ENVIRONMENT. THIS WAS CRUCIAL. IF ASTRONAUTS WERE GOING TO LAND IN THE COMING YEARS NASA AND SPECIFICALLY ITS CONTRACTOR GRUMMAN AEROSPACE NEEDED TO KNOW EVERYTHING IT COULD TO BUILD A LUNAR MODULE ABLE TO LAND SAFELY ON THE LUNAR SURFACE. THE SOVIETS MEANWHILE CARRIED ON WITH THE LUNA PROGRAM THOUGH IT WASN??T WITHOUT ITS OWN CHANGES. BEGINNING WITH LUNA 4 WHICH ATTEMPTED A LUNAR LANDING IN APRIL OF 1963 LUNA??S USED A YE-6 ARCHITECTURE. THE YE-6 SPACECRAFT MEASURED NEARLY NINE FEET IN HEIGHT AND ABOUT FIVE FEET ACROSS AT ITS BASE. THE CORE WAS A CYLINDRICAL SECTION CONTAINING MANEUVERING AND LANDING ROCKETS AS WELL AS THE FUEL TO FIRE THEM ORIENTATION SYSTEMS AND RADIO TRANSMITTERS TO TALK TO THE EARTH. A SPHERICAL SECTION ON TOP CONTAINED A LANDING HEMISPHERE. THE IDEA WAS TO HAVE THE LANDER EJECT FROM THE MAIN BODY ONCE IT WAS ON THE MOON AT WHICH POINT IT WOULD BE ABLE TO USE ITS ONBOARD CAMERA AND INSTRUMENTS TO MEASURE THE RADIATION ENVIRONMENT ON THE MOON. LIKE SO MANY MISSIONS OF THE NASCENT SPACE AGE THE FIRST YE-6 MISSIONS DIDN??T FARE TOO WELL. LUNAS 4 5 6 7 AND 8 WERE YE-6 MISSIONS AND THEY ALL FAILED TO MAKE A SOFT LANDING ON THE MOON. BUT WITH LUNA 9 THE SOVIET UNION BROKE ITS LOSING STREAK. THE MISSION LAUNCHED ON JANUARY 31 1966 ON A SS-6 ROCKET THE FOURTH STAGE OF WHICH SENT THE PAYLOAD CAREENING TOWARDS THE MOON. THREE DAYS LATER ON FEBRUARY 3 46.5 MILES ABOVE THE MOON??S SURFACE THE SPACECRAFT??S RETROROCKETS FIRED TO SLOW LUNA 9??S DESCENT TOWARDS THE SURFACE. A LITTLE MORE THAN SIXTEEN FEET ABOVE THE SURFACE A CONTACT SENSOR TOUCHED THE GROUND SIGNALING TO THE LANDING CAPSULE TO EJECT FROM THE MAIN SPACECRAFT. IT LANDED TRAVELING AT 13.6 MILES PER HOUR BOUNCED A FEW TIMES THEN FINALLY CAME TO REST IN THE OCEAN OF STORMS. AFTER A LITTLE MORE THAN FOUR MINUTES FOUR PETALS ON THE LANDED POD OPENED OUTWARD TO STABILIZE THE SPACECRAFT. SPRING-LOADED ANTENNAS LOCKED INTO TRANSMISSION POSITION AND A TELEVISION CAMERA SYSTEM SPRUNG TO LIFE SURVEYING THE SURROUNDING ENVIRONMENT. OVER THE COURSE OF 8 HOURS AND 5 MINUTES IMAGES WERE SENT BACK AND ASSEMBLED ON EARTH TO SHOW A PANORAMIC IMAGE FROM THE SURFACE OF THE MOON. THE MISSION ENDED THREE DAYS LATER ON FEBRUARY 6 WHEN THE LANDED SPACECRAFT??S BATTERIES RAN OUT OF POWER. LUNA 9??S SUCCESS WAS AN HISTORIC FIRST WITH NEVER-BEFORE-SEEN IMAGES TO PROVE ITS VALIDITY AND IT WAS ANOTHER IN A STUNNING STRING OF FIRSTS FOR THE SOVIETS IN SPACE. THE STUNNING LIST OF LUNAR FIRSTS??FIRST PROBE THAT IMPACTED THE MOON THE FIRST MISSION FLYBY AND PHOTOGRAPH THE FARSIDE THE FIRST SOFT LANDING THE FIRST ORBITAL MISSION AND THE FIRST MISSION TO CIRCLE THE MOON AND RETURN TO EARTH??PARALLELS THE SOVIETS?? SUCCESS IN OTHER AREAS OF SPACEFLIGHT INCLUDING LAUNCHING THE FIRST SATELLITE AND FIRST HUMAN INTO ORBIT. FROM THE START THE SOVIET UNION DEVOTED RESOURCES INTO ITS SPACE PROGRAM TO STAY AHEAD OF THE UNITED STATES. BUT THIS SOVIET LEADERSHIP COULDN??T COMMIT TO A FIRM GOAL THE WAY THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS DID WITH THE LUNAR LANDING GOAL. WITH WANING FIRM LEADERSHIP AND RESOURCES INCREASINGLY DIVIDED BETWEEN AGENCIES THE SOVIET UNION FELL BEHIND THE UNITED STATES MAKING LUNA 9 ONE OF THE LAST SOVIET FIRSTS IN SPACE.

AND AN ASSORTMENT OF TRADING CARDS ACTION FIGURES AND SUCH THAT TOLD THE STORY OF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE REBELLION IN BETWEEN THE EVENTS OF EMPIRE STRIKES BACK AND RETURN OF THE JEDI. IN 1994 LUCASFILM STARTED DEVELOPING A PROJECT SPANNING SEVERAL DIFFERENT FORMATS IN THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE. IT WOULD BE CALLED SHADOWS OF THE EMPIRE WHICH IS NOT A MISSPELLING. (SHADOWS PLURALIZED IS THE NAME OF THE ??90S PRODUCTS WHILE SHADOW WAS THE WORKING NAME FOR FORCE AWAKENS.) ACCORDING TO A BOOK CALLED THE SECRETS OF STAR WARS: SHADOWS OF THE EMPIRE AN EXHAUSTIVE LOOK AT THIS MULTIMEDIA VENTURE THE IDEA FOR SHADOWS CAME ABOUT IN A MEETING BETWEEN LUCASFILM AND BANTAM BOOKS WHICH HAD PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED SEVERAL STAR WARS NOVELS.?Ÿ THANKS TO LUCASFILM??S UNIQUE LICENSING AGREEMENT??WHICH ALLOWED GEORGE LUCAS TO RETAIN THE RIGHTS TO HIS BELOVED CREATIONS??EXECUTIVES PROPOSED A PROJECT IN WHICH ONE STORY WOULD BE TOLD ACROSS DIFFERENT PLATFORMS. WITH APPROVAL FROM LUCAS THE ??MOVIE PROJECT WITHOUT THE MOVIE? AS VARIOUS PARTICIPANTS CALLED IT WAS UNDERWAY BY 1996. THE SHADOWS STORY WOULD FILL IN THE DETAILS BETWEEN EPISODES V AND VI A CHUNK OF THE STAR WARS CANON LUCAS HAD PREVIOUSLY CONSIDERED OFF-LIMITS. IN IT WE SAW LUKE LEIA CHEWIE AND LANDO TRY TO SAVE HAN SOLO FROM THE BOUNTY HUNTER BOBA FETT WHILE CAUGHT IN A FEUD BREWING WITHIN THE RANKS OF THE EMPIRE. SOME OF THE STORY WAS DESIGNED TO EXPLAIN PUZZLING DETAILS IN THE JEDI FILM LIKE THE DISGUISE LEIA WORE AT JABBA??S PALACE. OTHER PARTS HELPED SET UP THE BATTLE TO DESTROY THE SECOND DEATH STAR ON ENDOR.?Ÿ SHADOWS ALSO INTRODUCED NEW CHARACTERS LIKE DASH RENDAR WHO WAS MORE OR LESS A CARBON COPY OF HAN SOLO RIGHT DOWN TO HIS SMUGGLER??S BACKGROUND AND REBELLIOUS ATTITUDE. HE FLEW A SHIP THAT RESEMBLED THE MILLENNIUM FALCON GOT INVOLVED IN A CHASE FEATURING HOVERING MOTORBIKES AND IS EVEN RETCONNED ON HOTH THE SNOWY PLANET FROM EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. IF YOU THOUGHT FORCE AWAKENS WAS A HODGEPODGE REGURGITATION OF A NEW HOPE STAR WARS WAS RECYCLING ITSELF LONG BEFORE DISNEY THREW MONEY AT IT. DARK HORSE??S SHADOWS OF THE EMPIRE COMICS MEANWHILE WERE TOLD FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF BOUNTY HUNTERS LIKE BOBA FETT. THE VIDEO GAME PUBLISHED BY LUCASARTS TOOK RENDAR AND THE REBELLION??S PERSPECTIVE AND THE NOVEL JUMPED BETWEEN PLOTS FEATURING DARTH VADER AND THE EMPIRE. OTHER OFFICIAL PRODUCTS SUCH AS TOYS CARDS MODELS AND STATUES WERE MADE BY COMPANIES LIKE KENNER AND TOPPS. EVEN AN OFFICIAL SOUNDTRACK WAS RELEASED THOUGH IT WAS NOT BY JOHN WILLIAMS THE ORIGINAL COMPOSER FOR THE FILMS. ??EVERYTHING BUT THE MOVIE? INDEED. WHAT STARTED AS SOMETHING OF A CASH GRAB BECAME THE BIGGEST STAR WARS PROJECT SINCE THE '80S. THE SCALE OF SHADOWS?? CROSS-PLATFORM MARKETING PUSH WAS A FIRST FOR THE FRANCHISE AND WOULD SOON BECOME THE TEMPLATE. (NOW SUCH A BLITZ IS STANDARD FOR NEW INSTALLMENTS IN THE OUTER SPACE TALE AS SEEN WITH THE AGGRESSIVE TWO-YEAR MARKETING CAMPAIGN FOR THE FORCE AWAKENS.) DESPITE MIXED REVIEWS SHADOWS OF THE EMPIRE SATISFIED FANS UNTIL THE PREQUELS AND SPECIAL EDITION FILMS DESTROYED THEIR HOPES. WHEN DISNEY BOUGHT LUCASFILM FOR $4 BILLION IN 2012 HOWEVER IT WAS DECIDED THAT ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF THE MOVIES AND CLONE WARS TV SERIES WOULD NOW BE CONSIDERED LEGENDS MEANING NON-CANON. SHADOWS WAS LUMPED INTO THIS CATEGORY DESPITE ITS SPECIFIC PLACE IN THE STAR WARS CANON TIMELINE. BUT NOT EVERYTHING FROM SHADOWS WAS LOST.

FIENNES WILL CO-STAR AS JACKSON IN A MOVIE TITLED ELIZABETH MICHAEL & MARLON SET TO PREMIERE LATER THIS YEAR. THE FILM IS A COMEDIC RETELLING OF A FABLED STORY INVOLVING THE KING OF POP ELIZABETH TAYLOR AND MARLON BRANDO ON A ROAD TRIP FROM NEW YORK CITY TO LOS ANGELES ON SEPTEMBER 11 2001. ACCLAIMED ACTORS STOCKARD CHANNING AND BRIAN COX AS TAYLOR AND BRANDO RESPECTIVELY ARE SO PITCH-PERFECTLY CAST THAT NEITHER REQUIRES MUCH IF ANY FURTHER EXPLANATION. BUT FIENNES AS JACKSON IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT STORY ALTOGETHER. FIENNES SPOKE ABOUT THE BIZARRE PROJECT AND ACKNOWLEDGED THAT PLAYING THE MEGASTAR JACKSON WOULD BE ??A CHALLENGE.? THE SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE ACTOR ALSO DISCUSSED THE TONE OF THIS BIZARRE COMEDY BASED ON A DISPUTED VANITY FAIR STORY ABOUT THE TRIO OF LEGENDS WHO UNABLE TO SECURE A FLIGHT OUT OF NEW YORK ON 9/11 TOOK THEIR SHOW ON THE ROAD. ??I GOT THE SCRIPT THE OTHER DAY? FIENNES EXPLAINED TO WENN. ??IT??S A CHALLENGE. IT??S A COMEDY. IT DOESN??T POKE MEAN FUN BUT IT??S A STORY POSSIBLY URBAN LEGEND WHEREBY MICHAEL MARLON BRANDO AND LIZ TAYLOR WERE ALL TOGETHER THE DAY BEFORE 9/11 DOING A CONCERT. AIRSPACE WAS SHUT DOWN AND THEY COULDN??T GET OUT AND MICHAEL HAD THE BRIGHT IDEA TO GO TO HIRE A CAR AND DRIVE.? ??SO THE THREE OF THEM GOT IN A CAR AND DROVE 500 MILES TO LOS ANGELES. IT TOOK THEM A WHILE BECAUSE THEY HAD TO STOP AT A LOT OF BURGER KINGS FOR MARLON BUT THEY GOT OUT!? FIENNES DIDN??T MUCH HOWEVER TO ADDRESS THE 500-POUND ELEPHANT (NO NOT BRANDO) IN THE ROOM: WHY WAS A WHITE ACTOR CAST TO PLAY AN AFRICAN AMERICAN ENTERTAINER? EVEN ONE WITH JACKSON??S SPECIFIC PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES AT THAT POINT IN HIS LIFE??HE SUFFERED FROM VITILIGO WHICH CAUSES THE SKIN TO LOSE THEIR PIGMENT??IT??S NOT BEYOND REASON TO CONSIDER THAT THERE ARE QUALIFIED BLACK ACTORS OUT THERE THAT COULD CONVINCINGLY PORTRAY MICHAEL JACKSON. ONE HAS TO WONDER IF THERE IS ALL THAT MUCH CONSIDERATION GIVEN TO GETTING THIS ??RIGHT? AT ALL ESPECIALLY WHEN CONSIDERING THESE INDUSTRIES?? INHERENT PREFERENCE FOR WHITE FACES TO SELL. OF COURSE THIS LATEST BIT OF QUESTIONABLE CASTING COMES IN THE MIDST OF A HIGHLY VISIBLE DIALOGUE ON RACE IN MAINSTREAM CINEMA. THE LACK OF DIVERSITY AMONG THIS YEAR??S ACADEMY AWARD NOMINEES HAS LED TO A REVAMP OF THE VOTING SYSTEM AND OF THE ACADEMY ITSELF AS WELL AS A MUCH LARGER CONVERSATION ON OPPORTUNITIES IN FRONT OF AND BEHIND THE CAMERA THROUGHOUT THE MANY TIERS OF HOLLYWOOD. WHILE BRITS CHARLOTTE RAMPLING AND MICHAEL CAINE SHRUGGED OFF THE #OSCARSSOWHITE CAMPAIGN (RAMPLING EVEN SAID IT WAS ??RACIST AGAINST WHITES?) UK STAR ELBA RECENTLY SPOKE TO THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT REGARDING THE LACK OF VARIED OPPORTUNITIES FOR NON-WHITE ACTORS IN BRITISH ENTERTAINMENT AND HOW IT AFFECTED HIM BOTH AS A BLACK FAN AND AS A BLACK ACTOR. ??BECAUSE I NEVER SAW MYSELF ON TV I STOPPED WATCHING TV? HE SAID. ??INSTEAD I DECIDED TO JUST GO OUT AND BECOME TV.? ??THERE WASN??T ENOUGH IMAGINATION IN THE INDUSTRY FOR ME TO BE SEEN AS A LEAD? ELBA SAID. ??WHEN YOU DON??T REFLECT THE REAL WORLD TOO MUCH TALENT GETS TRASHED. THROWN ON THE SCRAPHEAP. TALENT IS EVERYWHERE OPPORTUNITY ISN??T. AND TALENT CAN??T REACH OPPORTUNITY.? ELBA ALSO SHARED HIS BELIEF THAT HOLLYWOOD WAS FAR AHEAD OF THE UK REGARDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR. ??I WENT TO AMERICA BECAUSE I WAS RUNNING OUT OF PARTS? HE SAID. ??THE USA HAS THE MOST FAMOUS DIVERSITY POLICY OF ALL: THE AMERICAN DREAM. I WANT THAT BRITISH DREAM.? IF HOLLYWOOD IS THE STANDARD-BEARER FOR OPPORTUNITY THEN WE SHOULD ALL BE DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE STATE OF DIVERSITY IN THE FILM INDUSTRY. THAT ISN??T INTENDED TO BE GLIB BUT TO CONVEY THE GRAVITY OF THE PROBLEM HOW DEEPLY WE MUST GO TO UPROOT AND RECTIFY IT. THERE IS BOTH A CASUAL AMBIVALENCE AND QUIET HOSTILITY TOWARDS BROADENING THE RANGE OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR NON-WHITE STARS TO TRULY THRIVE IN THE MAINSTREAM AND THINGS LIKE CASTING A WHITE MAN TO PLAY MICHAEL JACKSON ONLY SERVE AS FURTHER PROOF THAT THERE ARE FILMMAKERS WHO ARE DEEPLY DETERMINED TO TUNE OUT THE CULTURAL CONVERSATION. BRITISH ACTOR AND SONS OF ANARCHY STAR CHARLIE HUNNAM WAS ANNOUNCED AS THE LEAD IN THE UPCOMING AMERICAN DRUG LORD THE STORY OF MEXICAN-AMERICAN EDGAR VALDEZ VILLARREAL WHO WENT FROM TEXAS HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL STAR TO BRUTAL CARTEL LEADER KNOWN AS ??LA BARBIE.? VILLAREAL??S NICKNAME WAS ATTRIBUTED TO THE FACT THAT HE HAD BLUE EYES AND A FAIR COMPLEXION ??LIKE A KEN DOLL.? ??IT SEEMS NOT WELL THOUGHT-THROUGH TO BE UPSET OVER CASTING AN EXCELLENT ACTOR TO ACT AS A CHARACTER WITH WHOM HE SEEMS TO SHARE MANY PHYSICAL RESEMBLANCES? ARGUED PRODUCER VINCENT NEWMAN. ??I SUPPOSE THOSE OFFENDED BY THIS WOULD HAVE DISQUALIFIED AL PACINO FROM ACTING AS TONY MONTANA OR JAMES CAAN AS SONNY CORLEONE. IT??S ACTING AFTER ALL AND THE MERIT OF THE CHOICE WILL BE ASSESSED AS IT IS WITH ALL CASTING CHOICES ON THE QUALITY AND BELIEVABILITY OF HIS PERFORMANCE.? PACINO??S FAMOUSLY OVER-THE-TOP FAUX CUBANO SCARFACE SHTICK ISN??T EXACTLY THE BEST PERFORMANCE TO CITE AS FAR AS WHITE ACTORS TACKLING ??ETHNIC? CHARACTERS BUT WHEN THERE IS ALREADY EVIDENCE OF CLEAR RACIAL BIAS IN WHICH ACTORS ARE EVEN CONSIDERED FOR ROLES IN THE FIRST PLACE IT SHOULD BE CLEAR WHY CASTING FIENNES AS THE FAMOUSLY PALE JACKSON OR HUNNAM AS LA BARBIE RAISES QUESTIONS. HOW MANY ACTUALLY BLACK OR LATINO ACTORS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO LAND THESE ROLES? HOW MANY PRODUCERS ALREADY KNOW FROM THE FIRST READING OF THE SCRIPT THAT THEY WOULD PREFER TO CAST WHITE GUYS WHO LOOK LIKE NON-WHITE GUYS AS OPPOSED TO PROPER BLACK/LATINO LEADS? THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT RECOGNIZE HOW RACIAL BIASES IN CASTING GREEN-LIGHTING AND MARKETING FILMS ARE AS DETRIMENTAL AS FLAGRANT RACIST CONTEMPT. AND LONG AFTER AWARDS SEASON HAS PASSED WE??LL BE LEFT TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS IF WE ARE COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING THE DISPARITIES THAT LEAD TO WHITE GUYS DECIDING WHO AND WHAT GOES ONSCREEN. JOSEPH FIENNES AS MICHAEL JACKSON IS A SYMPTOM OF A DEEPER SICKNESS THAT MOVIEMAKERS ARE ONLY NOW BEGINNING TO TREAT. THIS MOVIE WON??T BE THE FINAL SAY ON THIS SUBJECT BUT AS IT HAPPENS IT ADDS FUEL TO A VERY NECESSARY CONVERSATION. HERE??S HOPING MAJOR FILM STUDIOS IN BOTH AMERICA AND BRITAIN PAY CLOSER ATTENTION TO THAT CONVERSATION AND DO MORE THAN PAY LIP SERVICE TO THOSE INITIATING IT. AND HERE??S HOPING WE DON??T GET A RALPH FIENNES CAMEO AS JERMAINE. ,91623.0

AND IT'S TERRIFYING.,"LIKE MANY MEMBERS OF THE MEDIA I HAVE SPENT MUCH OF THE PAST SIX MONTHS PRETENDING I HAVE SOME IDEA OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.?Ÿ SPECIFICALLY I HAVE MAINTAINED A SANGUINE AND SOMEWHAT BEMUSED CERTAINTY THAT WHATEVER ELSE HAPPENS THERE WILL BE NO PRESIDENT TRUMP.?Ÿ TODAY WITH EVERY MEANING OF THIS PHRASE I FEAR I HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN. AT THIS MOMENT WITH THE FINAL DES MOINES REGISTER POLL IN [LINK] AND CONSIDERING WHAT I HAVE SEEN AND READ ABOUT TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS IN IOWA AND ELSEWHERE IT WOULD BE FOOLISH TO SAY THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP ISN??T A POSSIBILITY. AND THAT IS TERRIFYING.?Ÿ HERE ARE THE THINGS I HAVE SAID TO TAMP DOWN THE NOTION THAT TRUMP COULD WIN THE NOMINATION:?Ÿ ?Ÿ??THE ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS WILL RALLY BEHIND A CANDIDATE.? ??HE DOESN??T SPEAK THE LANGUAGE OF THE EVANGELICAL VOTER.? ??VETERANS WILL SEE RIGHT THROUGH HIM.? ??HE DOESN??T HAVE A REAL INFRASTRUCTURE OR GROUND GAME.? ??YOU CAN??T WIN WITHOUT MAKING SIGNIFICANT AD BUYS.? ??HIS NEGATIVES ARE TOO HIGH TO GET VERY FAR? ??HIS SUPPORTERS AREN??T DEDICATED ENOUGH TO CAUCUS.? I??M STILL HOLDING ON TO SOME HOPE FOR THE LAST ONE. (NOT SINCE HIGH SCHOOL HAVE I WISHED SO FERVENTLY FOR?ŸA SNOW DAY.) THE REST OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS HAVE EITHER BEEN FALSIFIED OR CALLED INTO SIGNIFICANT QUESTION.?Ÿ YOU??LL NOTICE I DIDN??T EVEN BOTH LISTING THE NUMEROUS THINGS TRUMP HAS SAID TO OFFEND PEOPLE. I HAVE STOPPED BELIEVING IT IS POSSIBLE FOR TRUMP TO GIVE OFFENSE ?? OR RATHER I HAVE STOPPED BELIEVING THAT GIVING OFFENSE IS A REASON PEOPLE WOULD CEASE TO SUPPORT HIM.?Ÿ ALL HE REALLY NEEDS TO DO IS WIN IOWA -- AN INCREASINGLY LIKELY OUTCOME. AFTER THAT?? WELL TELL ME THE FIRST STATE HE'LL LOSE. NOT NEW HAMPSHIRE (LEADS BY 18). NOT SOUTH CAROLINA (LEADS BY 15). NOT NEVADA (LEADS BY 12). SUPER TUESDAY STATES HAVE BEEN INFREQUENTLY POLLED BUT THE TWO WITH THE BIGGEST DELEGATE PRIZES (PROPORTIONALLY DISTRIBUTED) HAVE RECENT RESULTS. TRUMP LEADS IN GEORGIA BY 10 POINTS AND IN TEXAS THE \POLL OF POLLS? HAS HIM CLOSING THE GAP WITH AHEM \""NATIVE SON\"" CRUZ TO JUST TWO POINTS. IN FLORIDA HE LEADS BY 17 POINTS.?Ÿ WHAT??S MORE POLLS OF A SHRINKING FIELD SEEM TO SUGGEST THAT AS LONG AS A STANDARD-BEARER FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT REMAINS IN THE RACE TRUMP WILL CONTINUE TO DOMINATE. CRUZ EMERGES THE VICTOR ONLY IN A HEAD-TO-HEAD BATTLE ?? A BITTERSWEET INDICATION FOR CRUZ THAT HE IS NOT QUITE AS HATED BY MODERATE REPUBLICANS AS HE EITHER CLAIMS OR SHOULD BE. I WILL REFRAIN FROM RUNNING THROUGH SPECIFIC GENERAL ELECTION SCENARIOS BECAUSE -- SHE SIGHS HEAVILY -- WE ARE NOT THERE YET. HERE IS WHERE WE ARE: THE STRONG POSSIBILITY THAT TRUMP WILL GET THE GOP NOMINATION AND THAT MEANS THAT THERE IS A NON-ZERO CHANCE THAT HE WILL WIN THE GENERAL ELECTION.?Ÿ NON-ZERO IS TO SAY THE LEAST LESS THAT CERTAIN BUT IT'S A GREATER CHANCE THAN MOST POLITICAL PROFESSIONALS HAVE GIVEN HIM UP UNTIL?? NOW. AND NON-ZERO IS ENOUGH TO SCARE THE SHIT OUT OF ME.?Ÿ RATIONALLY A TRUMP PRIMARY VICTORY IS CLEARLY DISTURBING BUT UNTIL THIS WEEK I HADN??T CONSIDERED IT BEYOND AN UNCOMFORTABLE COMMENTARY ON THE REPUBLICAN ELECTORATE ON THE WAY TO A CERTAIN DEMOCRATIC VICTORY.?Ÿ I MEAN RIGHT? ER RIGHT? IF WE ?? I ?? HAVE BEEN SO WRONG ABOUT TRUMP??S CHANCES AT MAKING TO THE GENERAL THEN I THINK IT??S ONLY APPROPRIATE TO QUESTION ALL OUR ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT HIS CHANCES NATIONALLY.?Ÿ I SPENT MUCH OF THIS WEEK READING AND WATCHING INTERVIEWS WITH TRUMP SUPPORTERS. I??D TAKEN THE?Ÿ PREVIOUSLY REPORTED INCIDENTS OF SLURS AND SCUFFLES AT RALLIES SERIOUSLY OF COURSE. BUT A DISTRACTING VOICE IN MY HEAD COUNTERED THAT CROWDS TAKE ON THEIR OWN PERSONALITIES THAT PROTESTERS OFTEN INTEND TO PROVOKE RESPONSES AND THAT BESIDES COULD YOU REALLY ASCRIBE THE SAME LEVEL OF UGLINESS TO EVERYONE? SURELY THOSE RESPONSES WERE THE EXTREME OF THE EXTREME. GO READ THE REPORT PUT TOGETHER BY CNN. IT??S A COLLECTION OF QUOTES LEFT TO STAND MOSTLY ON THEIR OWN TAKEN NOT FROM THOSE KICKING AND PUNCHING AND SHOUTING BUT THE REST OF THE CROWD. THERE IS NOTHING NEW HERE NOT REALLY IT??S THE SAME ILL-INFORMED NATIONALIST DOGGEREL AS HE SPOUTS.?Ÿ IT??S CHILLING NOT BECAUSE IT??S SOMEHOW MORE EXTREME THAN YOU THOUGHT IT??D BE BUT RATHER BECAUSE THEIR COMPLAINTS ARE SO UNIFORM AND MATTER-OF-FACT: \""WHITE AMERICANS FOUNDED THIS COUNTRY? ONE 64-YEAR-OLD WOMAN TOLD CNN. \""WE ARE BEING PUSHED ASIDE BECAUSE OF THE PRESIDENT'S ADMINISTRATION AND THE MEDIA.\"" A RECENT STUDY DELIVERED STATISTICAL PROOF OF THE MINDSET ONLY IMPLIED BY THE LANGUAGE: TRUMP SUPPORTERS ARE ATTRACTED TO A QUALITY THAT GOES BEYOND ??BEING A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMAN.? THEY ARE ATTRACTED TO HIS AUTHORITARIANISM. THEY ARE IN FACT IN FAVOR OF TURNING AUTHORITARIAN IDEAS INTO POLICY: TRUMP VOTERS EXHIBIT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT AND SUBSTANTIVE AUTHORITARIAN ATTITUDES. FOR EXAMPLE TRUMP VOTERS ARE STATISTICALLY MORE LIKELY TO AGREE THAT OTHER GROUPS SHOULD SOMETIMES BE KEPT IN THEIR PLACE. THEY SUPPORT PREVENTING MINORITY OPPOSITION ONCE WE DECIDE WHAT IS RIGHT. TRUMP SUPPORTERS KICK THE FUNDAMENTAL TENETS OF MADISONIAN DEMOCRACY TO THE CURB ASSERTING THAT THE RIGHTS OF MINORITIES NEED NOT BE PROTECTED FROM THE POWER OF THE MAJORITY. AND THEY ARE STATISTICALLY MORE LIKELY THAN TRUMP OPPONENTS TO AGREE THE PRESIDENT SHOULD CURTAIL THE VOICE AND VOTE OF THE OPPOSITION WHEN IT IS NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE COUNTRY. TO PUT IT ANOTHER WAY. THE FRIGHTENING THING ABOUT TRUMP VOTERS IS NOT THAT THEY??RE ANGRY IT??S THAT THEY BELIEVE THEY??RE RIGHT??AND THEY BELIEVE THEY??RE WINNING.?Ÿ TRUMP HAS TO USE LANGUAGE TRUMPKINS WOULD LIKELY SNEER AT EMPOWERED THEM. THAT SENSE OF EMPOWERMENT MATTERS BECAUSE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AUTHORITARIANS AND POPULISTS IS ANY SENSE OF RESPECT FOR MINORITY OPINIONS. IN A WORLD RUN BY AUTHORITARIANS THE ONLY BREAK ON UNJUST BEHAVIOR IS WHETHER YOU CAN GET AWAY IT. SO NOW IMAGINE A TRUMP NOMINATION. IMAGINE HOW EMPOWERING THAT WOULD BE AND TO WHOM. THERE ARE TWO PREVAILING THEORIES FOR WHY JOURNALISTS AND DATA CRUNCHERS GOT TRUMP??S TRAJECTORY WRONG. ONE ARGUMENT HAS IT THAT TRUMP??S CANDIDACY IS A \""BLACK SWAN EVENT???AN UNPRECEDENTED AMALGAM OF UNREPRODUCIBLE AND UNPREDICTABLE CIRCUMSTANCES SIMPLY TOO WEIRD TO HAVE FORESEEN.?Ÿ I LIKE THAT THEORY BECAUSE IT LETS US OFF THE HOOK SOMEWHAT. AND WELL IT??S NOT AN INACCURATE DESCRIPTION?? BUT IT??S REALLY MORE OF A DESCRIPTION THAN AN EXPLANATION. WHAT??S MORE: ALL SWANS LOOK GRAY IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR. THE END OF TRUMP MIGHT LOOK LIKE THE RISE OF NATIONALISM IN EUROPE OR MIGHT LOOK LIKE GOLDWATER??S DEFEAT. BUT IT WILL LOOK LIKE SOMETHING THAT HAS HAPPENED BEFORE BECAUSE EVERYTHING DOES. ANOTHER THEORY AS TO PUNDITS?? BLINKEREDNESS POPULAR ON THE RIGHT HAS IT THAT WE IN THE POLITICAL WORLD WERE SIMPLY?ŸTOO CAUGHT UP IN OUR COCKTAILS AND TV GREEN ROOM CHATTER TO NOTICE WHAT WAS GOING ON OUT THERE IN ??REAL AMERICA.??Ÿ THIS CERTAINLY FEELS CLOSE TO THE TRUTH. THERE IS DARKNESS TO BE FOUND OUT THERE IN THE RALLYING AROUND KIM DAVIS AND THE REJECTION OF CIVIL RIGHTS IN HOUSTON. ON THE OTHER HAND: ??REAL AMERICA? IS MULTIFACETED AND SELF-CONTRADICTORY LIKE MOST OTHER REAL THINGS. AMERICANS SHOW GROWING SUPPORT FOR AN INCREASED MINIMUM WAGE AND?ŸPOLICE BODY CAMERAS AND YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE?ŸA HISTORICALLY HIGH RATE OF INTERRACIAL DATING. HOW WERE WE SUPPOSED TO PICK OUT THE AUTHORITARIAN STRAIN FROM THE PROGRESSIVE ONE? I THINK WE DIDN??T SEE TRUMP COMING BECAUSE WE LACKED IMAGINATION.?Ÿ SCIENCE FICTION HAS DONE A BETTER JOB AT PREDICTING TRUMP'S SUCCESS THAN POLITICAL SCIENCE HAS AFTER ALL. NEAL STEPHENSON INTERFACE?ŸDESCRIBES A CANDIDATE GUIDED VIA THE INPUT OF REAL-TIME POLLING DATA DIRECTLY INTO HIS BRAIN. (HE EVEN DECIDES TO SKIP A DEBATE.) DARK MIRROR HAS PLUMBED THE PHENOMENON OF \""A ??JOKE? CANDIDATE BECOMING SO POPULAR THAT THE FORCES BEHIND HIM SLIP EASILY INTO DESPOTISM AND VIOLENCE. ?Ÿ SOCIAL SCIENTISTS AND JOURNALISTS IMPRISON THEMSELVES BEHIND CONVENTIONAL WISDOM AND TO A LESSER EXTENT EVIDENCE--THE DARK IMPULSES THAT FUEL TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS HAVE BEEN MOSTLY INVISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE: SURE AROUND THE FRINGES OF THE TEA PARTY AND IN THE TWISTY BOWELS OF INTERNET COMMENTS ONCE COULD SENSE THE ANGER AND RACISM BUT I AVOIDED LOOKING INTO THE ABYSS AND PREFERRED INSTEAD TO GESTURE TOWARDS THE MORE INTELLIGIBLE GAMESMANSHIP OF WASHINGTON INSIDERS. IT'S NO SECRET THAT TRUMP'S RISE HAS CREATED HISTORY'S LONGEST HOT MIC MOMENT FOR THE MEDIA. WE HAVE BEEN CAUGHT WITHOUT A SCRIPT AND THE ROTE TRUISMS AND FILLER MATERIAL THAT USUALLY FILLS THE AWKWARD SILENCES HAVE PROVEN INCREASINGLY INAPPROPRIATE TO THE UNPRECEDENTED TRAGICOMEDY PLAYING OUT BEFORE US. I NOW SEE WHAT MY PROBLEM WAS: IN DISCOUNTING TRUMP'S CHANCES I RELIED ON GUIDANCE FROM HISTORY AND REASON. THESE ARE INADEQUATE DEFENSES AGAINST THE FORCES AT WORK IN TRUMP'S RISE.?Ÿ LOGIC DIDN??T HELP US FORESEE HIM AND WON'T WORK AGAINST HIM. WE CAN??T ARGUE POLICY WE ARE GOING TO NEED SOMETHING MORE LIKE A PATRONUS.?Ÿ I AM NOT ENDORSING MAGICAL THINKING BELIEFS IN NO-COST SHORTCUTS LEGENDS AND MYTHICAL CREATURES ARE WHAT BROUGHT US TRUMP. BUT WE WILL NEED MORE THAN DEBATE A FORCE STRONGER THAN FACTS. I SUSPECT WE??LL NEED LOVE: LOVE FOR OUR COUNTRY FOR THE PEOPLE IN IT FOR THE IDEAS IT STANDS FOR.?Ÿ WE HAVE TO LOVE OUR COUNTRY AND WHAT IT CAN BE MORE THAN TRUMP SUPPORTERS FEAR WHAT THEY BELIEVE IT??S BECOMING. HIS POWER STEMS FROM THEIR BELIEF IN THAT DARKNESS - AND WITH PERSISTENCE AND PATIENCE AND HEART WE??RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE THEM THE LIGHT. """,87554.0

AND FOR THE GUN SAFETY ADVOCATES AND GUN VIOLENCE SURVIVORS PACKED INTO THE EAST ROOM OF THE WHITE HOUSE TUESDAY MORNING IT WAS A HUGE MOMENT IN A FIGHT THAT FOR TOO LONG HAS SEEMED STALEMATED. ??THE GUN LOBBY MAY BE HOLDING CONGRESS HOSTAGE NOW BUT THEY CAN??T HOLD AMERICA HOSTAGE? OBAMA DECLARED AS HE OUTLINED THE EXECUTIVE ACTIONS HE IS TAKING TO CIRCUMVENT CONGRESS AND EXPAND BACKGROUND CHECKS TO COVER THE GROWING COMMERCE OF GUNS OVER THE INTERNET. ??THIS IS A GREAT DAY FOR RESPONSIBLE GUN OWNERS? SAID RETIRED ASTRONAUT CAPTAIN MARK KELLY WHOSE WIFE GABBY GIFFORDS GOT A STANDING OVATION AS SHE ENTERED THE EAST ROOM. GIFFORDS WAS SHOT IN THE HEAD ALONG WITH 18 OTHERS OUTSIDE A SUPERMARKET IN TUCSON FIVE YEARS AGO THIS WEEK. ??WE??RE GRATEFUL TO THE PRESIDENT FOR STANDING UP TO THE GUN LOBBY? KELLY SAID AFTER THE WHITE HOUSE EVENT DESCRIBING HIMSELF TO REPORTERS AS A STRONG SUPPORTER OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT. OBAMA??S NEARLY 40-MINUTE LONG SPEECH WAS THANKFULLY MORE SERMON THAN COLLEGE LECTURE AS HE SOUGHT TO MOBILIZE ACTIVISTS AND VOTERS ALIKE FOR THE LONG BATTLE AHEAD. AND ONE POINT TEARS VISIBLY STREAMED DOWN HIS FACE. HE DIDN??T USE THE WORD ??MOVEMENT? TO DESCRIBE THE INCREASING ARRAY OF GUN SAFETY GROUPS SOME LAUNCHED IN THE WAKE OF THE SANDY HOOK MASSACRE BUT HE REMINDED HIS AUDIENCE THAT THE WOMEN??S RIGHT TO VOTE AND THE LIBERATION OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS DIDN??T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT AND LGBT RIGHTS TOOK DECADES OF WORK. ??JUST BECAUSE IT??S HARD IT??S NO EXCUSE NOT TO TRY? HE SAID AS HE ACKNOWLEDGED THE OBVIOUS THAT GUN VIOLENCE AND THE SCOURGE OF MASS SHOOTINGS WILL EXTEND BEYOND HIS PRESIDENCY. HE EXPRESSED HIS PUZZLEMENT AT HOW AMERICAN SOCIETY HAS REACHED A POINT WHERE MASS VIOLENCE ERUPTS WITH SUCH FREQUENCY THAT IT SEEMS ALMOST NORMAL ??AND INSTEAD OF TALKING ABOUT HOW TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM IT??S BECOME ONE OF THE MOST PARTISAN AND POLARIZING DEBATES.? HE PUT IN A PLUG FOR A TOWN MEETING HE IS DOING THURSDAY EVENING THAT WILL BE TELEVISED ON CNN. ??I??M NOT ON THE BALLOT AGAIN. I??M NOT LOOKING TO SCORE SOME POINTS? HE SAID ADDING THAT HE WANTS TO INSTILL WHAT DR. KING CALLED ??THE FIERCE URGENCY OF NOW.? ??PEOPLE ARE DYING AND THE CONSTANT EXCUSES FOR INACTION NO LONGER SUFFICE? OBAMA SAID. ??WE??RE HERE NOT TO DEBATE THE LAST MASS SHOOTING BUT TO DO SOMETHING TO PREVENT THE NEXT MASS SHOOTING? A STATEMENT THAT GOT A BIG ROUND OF APPLAUSE. OBAMA??S RHETORIC AND HIS INVOCATIONS OF SOME OF THE LIVES LOST BROUGHT PEOPLE TO TEARS INCLUDING ATTORNEY GENERAL LYNCH TOP AIDE VALERIE JARRETT AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY SYLVIA BURWELL. EVERY YEAR MORE THAN 30000 AMERICANS DIE IN GUN SUICIDES DOMESTIC VIOLENCE GANG SHOOTOUTS AND ACCIDENTS AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS HAVE LOST FAMILY MEMBERS OR BURIED THEIR CHILDREN.?Ÿ ??MANY HAVE HAD TO LEARN TO LIVE WITH A DISABILITY OR WITHOUT THE LOVE OF THEIR LIFE? OBAMA SAID. ??HERE TODAY IN THIS ROOM RIGHT HERE THERE ARE A LOT OF STORIES A LOT OF HEARTACHE?? AND THIS IS ONLY A SMALL SAMPLE.??Ÿ AFTER THE EVENT SEVERAL PEOPLE STOOD OUT IN THE WHITE HOUSE DRIVEWAY IN THE BITTER COLD TELLING THEIR STORIES. AMONG THEM WAS JENNIFER PINCKNEY THE WIDOW OF SLAIN CHARLESTON MINISTER CLEMENTA PINCKNEY. SHE HELD A FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH OF HER HUSBAND AS SHE TOLD REPORTERS ABOUT HOW HER YOUNG DAUGHTERS ARE FRIGHTENED BY ANY SOUND THAT COULD BE A GUNSHOT. AFTER SANDY HOOK OBAMA SIGNED 23 EXECUTIVE ORDERS REINFORCING FEDERAL LAW IN AN ATTEMPT TO RESTRAIN GUN VIOLENCE AND IT??S TAKEN THE LAST YEAR TO NAVIGATE THE LEGAL THICKETS WHERE OBAMA FELT CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO GO FORWARD WITH CLOSING THE SO-CALLED ??GUN SHOW LOOPHOLE.? NEW GUIDELINES ON WHO QUALIFIES AS A GUN DEALER WENT UP ON AN ADMINISTRATION WEBSITE AS THE PRESIDENT SPOKE. NOTING THAT TWO IN THREE GUN DEATHS IS A SUICIDE OBAMA WANTS CONGRESS TO DO MORE TO FUND ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. TO THOSE IN CONGRESS WHO RUSH TO BLAME MENTAL ILLNESS AS A WAY TO AVOID THE GUN ISSUE HE SAID ??HERE??S YOUR CHANCE TO SUPPORT THESE EFFORTS.? HE ALSO PLEDGED TO PUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT??S RESEARCH ARM INCLUDING THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT BEHIND GUN SAFETY TECHNOLOGY. ??IF A CHILD CAN??T OPEN A BOTTLE OF ASPIRIN WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY CAN??T PULL THE TRIGGER ON A GUN.? THE EXPANSION OF BACKGROUND CHECKS SO THAT PEOPLE WITH CRIMINAL RECORDS DOMESTIC ASSAULT VIOLATIONS AND SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS CAN??T BUY GUNS IS POPULAR WITH ALL GROUPS INCLUDING 64 PERCENT OF GUN OWNERS AND 56 PERCENT OF THOSE WHO DESCRIBE THEMSELVES AS ??FAVORABLE TOWARD THE NRA? ACCORDING TO POLLSTER ANNA GREENBERG WHO CONDUCTED THE SURVEY JUST BEFORE THANKSGIVING FOR AMERICANS FOR RESPONSIBLE GUN SOLUTIONS FOUNDED BY KELLY AND GIFFORDS. NINETY PERCENT OF MILLENNIALS SUPPORT THE KIND OF ACTION OBAMA TOOK GREENBERG SAID.?Ÿ ELECTED OFFICIALS HAVE LONG MEMORIES AND BILL CLINTON STILL BLAMES THE DEMOCRATS?? LOSS OF CONGRESS IN 1994 ON THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE BRADY BILL AND AN ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN. A LOT OF BIG NAMES WENT DOWN IN THAT ELECTION AND GUN REGULATION WENT DOWN WITH THEM. WHAT OBAMA DID THIS WEEK IS ??THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENT SINCE THE BRADY BILL? MORE THAN 20 YEARS AGO SAID KELLY. IT??S A NICE TWIST OF FATE THAT HILLARY CLINTON MIGHT BE ABLE TO CAPITALIZE ON THE SHIFT. ??THANK YOU @POTUS FOR TAKING A CRUCIAL STEP FORWARD ON GUN VIOLENCE. OUR NEXT PRESIDENT HAS TO BUILD ON THAT PROGRESS---NOT RIP IT AWAY? SHE TWEETED AFTER OBAMA??S SPEECH.?ŸGUNS ARE ON THE AGENDA IN 2016 AND DEMOCRATS ARE NO LONGER COWERING WHICH SIGNALS A CULTURAL SHIFT THAT GOES BEYOND OBAMA??S STILL RATHER LIMITED EXECUTIVE ACTIONS.?Ÿ ,57200.0

65,9573494.0,2016-01-03T06:15:00+00:00,WHEN CHRISTIANS MUSLIMS AND JEWS LOVED MAGIC,IN 2014 A PAPER-THIN METAL SCROLL WAS DISCOVERED IN THE RUINS OF A CITY DESTROYED BY AN EARTHQUAKE IN JERASH (JORDAN) IN THE MID-8TH CENTURY. THE SCROLL WAS UNEARTHED IN A BATTERED LEAD CASE BUT WAS TOO FRAGILE TO BE UNFURLED.?Ÿ THIS FALL HOWEVER SCIENTISTS AT AARHUS UNIVERSITY IN DENMARK UNRAVELED ITS SECRETS. USING DIGITAL IMAGING OF THE LETTERING INSIDE THE SCIENTISTS WERE ABLE TO SEE THE WRITING. THE RESULTS APPEAR TO BE GIBBERISH BUT WHAT THE DISCOVERY DOES DO IS TELL US A GREAT DEAL ABOUT THE MARKET FOR MAGICAL OBJECTS IN THE ANCIENT WORLD. THE SCROLL IS MADE OF SILVER AND CONTAINS 17 LINES OF TEXT THAT WERE INSCRIBED WITH A FINE ROUNDED-TIPPED STYLUS (A SCRATCHY PEN).?Ÿ AFTER IT WAS INSCRIBED IT WAS ROLLED UP AND PLACED IN THE SMALL LEAD CONTAINER AND THERE IT STAYED. SCHOLARS BELIEVE THAT THE SILVER SCROLL IS AN AMULET. AMULETS ARE MAGICAL OBJECTS THAT ARE OFTEN WORN ON THE BODY TO WARD OFF ILL-FORTUNE BAD LUCK DEMONIC INTERFERENCE DISEASE AND DISASTER.?Ÿ ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT THE AMULET IS THAT IT IS WRITTEN IN A NON-LANGUAGE. IT RESEMBLES ARABIC BUT MANY OF THE LETTER FORMS ARE FORMED WITH A VERTICAL STROKE AND A NUMBER OF COMMONLY USED ARABIC LETTERS ARE COMPLETELY ABSENT. THIS HAS LED ARCHEOLOGISTS TO CONCLUDE THAT THIS IS PSEUDO-ARABIC NONSENSE. IT IS MADE TO RESEMBLE ARABIC (POSSIBLY BECAUSE THE CLIENT WAS AN ARAB) BUT IT DOESN??T CONVEY ACTUAL SUBSTANCE. THIS KIND OF PSEUDO-WRITING IS COMMON IN MAGICAL TEXTS: THERE ARE A NUMBER OF INCANTATION BOWLS AT THE BRITISH MUSEUM FOR EXAMPLE THAT ARE WRITTEN IN PSEUDO-ARAMAIC. AND AS THE STUDY POINTS OUT EXAMPLES OF THIS KIND OF THING ARE IN THE MUSLIM WORLD AS WELL. ?Ÿ THE FIND IS FASCINATING FOR WHAT IT TELLS US ABOUT RELIGIOUS COMMERCE IN JERASH IN THE EIGHTH CENTURY. AMULETS LIKE THIS WERE PROFESSIONALLY COMMISSIONED ?? YOU NEEDED SOMEONE WITH A FACILITY IN METALLURGY AND LETTERS IN ORDER TO PRODUCE THEM ?? AND WERE OFTEN TAILORED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER. THE PRODUCTION OF AMULETS WAS PROFESSIONALIZED AND THE ROLE OF THOSE WHO MADE THEM OFTEN OVERLAPPED AND COMPETED WITH THAT OF MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS.?Ÿ AMULETS WERE EXTREMELY POPULAR IN ANTIQUITY ESPECIALLY AMONG ANCIENT CHRISTIANS AND JEWS. EXAMPLES OF CHRISTIAN AMULETS JEWISH INCANTATION BOWLS AND SO FORTH CAN BE FOUND IN MUSEUMS ALL OVER THE WORLD. THIS WAS NOT A FRINGE PRACTICE. IT MIGHT SEEM SURPRISING THAT MEMBERS OF ANY OF THESE GROUPS (JEWS CHRISTIANS OR MUSLIMS) WERE USING AMULETS AT ALL. THIS IS LARGELY BECAUSE ALL THREE RELIGIONS DECRY THE USE OF ??MAGIC? BY THEIR ADHERENTS. SORCERY IS CONDEMNED IN LEVITICUS 19:26 AND SORCERERS ARE THROWN INTO THE LAKE OF FIRE IN REVELATION 21:8. BUT THE PROHIBITIONS AGAINST MAGIC SHOULDN??T LEAD US TO BELIEVE THAT CHRISTIANS AND JEWS WEREN??T ENGAGING IN THIS KIND OF RELIGION. IN FACT SOME OF OUR EARLIEST FRAGMENTS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT ARE VERSES OF THE BIBLE THAT WERE SCRATCHED ONTO PAPYRUS AND FOLDED UP TO BE WORN ON THE BODY. MOREOVER THE VERY FACT THAT THE BIBLE HAS TO CONDEMN SORCERY INDICATES THAT SOME PEOPLE WERE DOING IT.?Ÿ INTERESTINGLY THE PROBLEM WITH MAGIC IS NOT THAT IT DOESN??T WORK (BECAUSE IT DOES) BUT RATHER THAT THE SUPERNATURAL POWERS BY MAGIC COME FROM AN UNSANCTIONED SOURCE.?Ÿ IN THE APOCRYPHAL ACTS OF THE APOSTLES (LEGENDS ABOUT THE LIVES OF THE APOSTLES AFTER THE DEATH OF JESUS) THE PROTAGONISTS OFTEN RUN INTO DIFFICULTIES WHEN THEY ENCOUNTER OTHER MIRACLE-WORKERS. THESE MAGICIANS AREN??T AS POWERFUL AS THE TWELVE APOSTLES BUT THEY AREN??T CHARLATANS. ONE CALLED SIMON MAGUS CAN ACTUALLY FLY AND HAS A COMPETITION WITH THE APOSTLE PETER. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE CONSUMER THE REASON TO SIDE WITH PETER IS THAT HE IS MORE POWERFUL (HE CAN RAISE THE DEAD) BUT MANY OF THE MIRACLES THEY PERFORM ARE ACTUALLY IDENTICAL IN NATURE. THIS BRINGS US TO THE LARGER QUESTION ?? WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RELIGION AND MAGIC? BOTH CROSSES AND AMULETS ARE BELIEVED TO PROTECT THEIR OWNERS IS THERE AN ESSENTIAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO? SOME ANTHROPOLOGISTS HAVE ARGUED THAT THE DIFFERENCE IS ATTITUDINAL: MAGIC IS COERCIVE AND PRIVATE WHEREAS RELIGION IS SUPPLICATORY AND PUBLIC.?Ÿ OTHERS LIKE J. G. FRAZER IN HIS SEMINAL WORK THE GOLDEN BOUGH HAVE SEEN MAGIC AS JUST A MORE PRIMITIVE FORM OF RELIGION. OTHERS STILL HAVE POINTED OUT THAT RELIGION IS MAINSTREAM AND ORGANIZED WHILE MAGIC IS MARGINAL AND AD HOC. THESE DISTINCTIONS BREAK DOWN UPON CLOSE EXAMINATION. ARE SPELLS AND PRAYERS SO DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER WHEN BOTH ASK DEITIES TO DO THINGS FOR EXAMPLE? IS (TO PLAY DEVIL??S ADVOCATE) THE RITE OF EXORCISM IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH NOT AN ATTEMPT TO COERCE A SUPERNATURAL ALBEIT EVIL ENTITY??Ÿ THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN MAGIC AND RELIGION IS AS GRAHAM CUNNINGHAM POINTS OUT IN HIS BOOK RELIGION AND MAGIC VERY FLUID. IN MANY CASES THE DISTINCTION IS ABOUT RHETORIC. THE PORTRAYAL OF MAGIC AS LIMINAL AND SECRETIVE MAY REPRESENT THE SOCIAL STANDING OF CERTAIN ANCIENT HEALERS BUT IT ALSO MAKES THEM SEEN SHADY AND SUSPICIOUS. OFTEN MAGIC IS JUST CODE FOR ??BAD RELIGION? AND CALLING A PARTICULAR PRACTICE MAGIC IS A WAY TO SLANDER THAT GROUP. IT??S FOR THIS REASON THAT NINETEENTH CENTURY PROTESTANTS REGULARLY ACCUSED CATHOLICS OF PRACTICING MAGIC.?Ÿ THE NEWLY DISCOVERED SCROLL MAY WELL SUGGEST THAT ARABS IN EIGHTH CENTURY JERASH WERE ADOPTING THE RELIGIOUS PRACTICES OF THEIR JEWISH CHRISTIAN GREEK AND ROMAN NEIGHBORS. BUT IT ALSO REMINDS US THAT ONE WOMAN??S MAGIC IS ANOTHER WOMAN??S RELIGION.?Ÿ ,20523.0

(AN ESTIMATED 10000 CHILDREN IN ITALY HAVE AT LEAST ONE HOMOSEXUAL PARENT ACCORDING TO A NOW DECADE-OLD STUDY CONDUCTED BY ARCIGAY GAY RIGHTS ASSOCIATION IN 2005.) BECAUSE THE CIRINNA BILL AS IT STANDS DOES NOT ALLOW FOR AUTONOMOUS OR INDEPENDENT ADOPTION OF BABIES WHO ARE NOT RELATED TO EITHER MEMBER OF A SAME-SEX COUPLE OPPONENTS FEAR THAT ARTICLE 5 PROVIDES A LOOPHOLE THROUGH WHICH SAME-SEX COUPLES COULD EVENTUALLY ADOPT. OPPONENTS ALSO FEAR IT WOULD SURELY PAVE THE WAY FOR FULL AUTONOMOUS ADOPTIONS OR EVEN SURROGACY WHICH IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED IN ITALY.?Ÿ ON WEDNESDAY LAWMAKERS WHO OPPOSE THE BILL EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO PROPOSE A NEW SURROGACY LEGISLATION WHEREBY ANY PARENTS ??

THE LAW WOULD APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SURROGACY IS LEGAL IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COMMISSIONED.

ON TUESDAY OREGON STATE POLICE AND THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION LAID A ROADBLOCK NORTH OF BURNS WHERE THEY KNEW THAT AT LEAST AMMON AND RYAN BUNDY WOULD BE PASSING THROUGH FOR A MEETING WITH RESIDENTS. IT WAS THE PERFECT PLACE TO SET A TRAP: THE STRETCH OF CANYON THE ROAD PASSES THROUGH HAS NO CELL-PHONE RECEPTION FOR ABOUT AN HOUR AND IT??S NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO TURN AROUND IN. THE BUNDY GROUP RIDING IN TWO VEHICLES WERE STOPPED. AT SOME POINT LAVOY FINICUM ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE REFUGE OCCUPIERS GOT OUT OF A VEHICLE AND WAS SHOT TO DEATH BY POLICE. RYAN BUNDY BROTHER OF AMMON WAS SHOT IN THE ARM. THE BUNDYS WERE ARRESTED ON CHARGES OF CONSPIRACY TO OBSTRUCT FEDERAL AGENTS ALONG WITH SHAWNA COX BRYAN CAVALIER AND RYAN PAYNE. AT THE SAME TIME IN NEARBY BURNS LIVESTREAMER AND SELF-APPOINTED BUNDY SPOKESMAN PETE SANTILLI WAS ARRESTED. JOHN RITZHEIMER WHO WAS OCCUPYING THE REFUGE AND HAD BECOME ONE OF ITS MOST PROMINENT SPOKESMEN TURNED HIMSELF IN ON THE SAME CHARGES WHILE ON A VISIT HOME TO ARIZONA. IT APPEARS THE BUNDY CLAN KNEW ARREST OR WORSE WAS BECOMING MORE INEVITABLE WHEN AMMON??S DEPUTIES STARTED GOING HOME TO SAY GOODBYE TO THEIR FAMILIES. RITZHEIMER WAS IN ARIZONA AND SAID HE WAS PLANNING TO SEE HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN BEFORE HEADING BACK NORTH. AT LEAST TWO REFUGE OCCUPANTS HAVE TRAVELED TO UTAH AND BACK ALREADY. BACK IN OREGON THE ARRESTS HAVE ONLY ESCALATED TENSIONS. BRANDON CURTISS PRESIDENT OF THE IDAHO THREE PERCENTER MILITIA THAT HAS PATROLLED BURNS AND PROVIDED SECURITY FOR THE OCCUPIERS AT THE REFUGE SAID NO ONE??S LEAVING. ??WE??RE STILL GOING TO MAINTAIN OUR SAME POSITION THE COMMUNITY HAS ASKED US TO STAY AND WE??RE TRYING TO BE THERE THE BEST WE CAN FOR SUPPORT AND TO CONTINUE OUR INVESTIGATION? CURTISS TOLD THE DAILY BEAST ON WEDNESDAY MORNING. IN FACT A CLARION CALL HAS GONE OUT FROM OREGON TO MILITIA GROUPS AND THEY??RE HEEDING IT. LOCALS TOLD THE DAILY BEAST THEY SAW TRUCKLOADS OF NEW FACES COMING IN OVERNIGHT. ??I DIDN??T PICK THIS DAY MOM? SAYS ONE OF THE OCCUPIERS ON A CALL HOME THAT WAS LIVESTREAMED ONLINE. ??I BELIEVE GOD HAS THIS PLAN. I LOVE YOU.? IF YOU??VE EVER WANTED TO KNOW WHAT LOVE OF COUNTRY TAKEN TO AN EXTREME SOUNDS LIKE TURN ON ONE OF THE LIVESTREAMS AND HEAR PEOPLE TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY THINK THEY??RE SACRIFICING AND WHY. THE PLAN IS LESS PROVIDENTIAL THAN IT IS TACTICAL. PLENTY OF SUPPLIES (FOOD AND AMMO) HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO THE REFUGE SINCE THE TAKEOVER ON JAN. 2. UNLESS THE FEDS COME ONTO THE COMPOUND TO EVICT THE OCCUPANTS THIS COULD FEASIBLY GO ON FOR A FEW MONTHS. THEY KNEW IT WAS COMING EVENTUALLY OF COURSE. PEOPLE LAUGH AT THE MILITIA DUDES BUT PLENTY ARE EX-MILITARY AND KNOW EXACTLY HOW TO HANDLE TACTICS IN THIS SITUATION WHERE YOU MIGHT LOSE COMMAND AT ANY TIME. AND THEY??VE HAD WEEKS TO TALK IT OVER. IN CASE OF AMMON??S ARREST WHOMEVER HE??D LEFT IN CHARGE WOULD BE IN CHARGE. SINCE AMMON WAS ARRESTED WITH FOUR TOP DEPUTIES EVERYONE IS SIMPLY GOING TO CARRY OUT THE PLAN THAT WAS MADE FOR THIS EVENTUALITY. ??IT??S GOING TO BE IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTROL? SAYS CURTISS.?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ THE NEW LIKELY LEADER ON THE REFUGE BLAINE COOPER IS A SOFT-SPOKEN MAN WHO OFTEN DISAVOWS WHAT HE CONSIDERS FRINGE THEORIES??THOUGH HE THINKS THE GOVERNMENT KILLS WITH IMPUNITY AND HE??S JUST BEEN GIVEN EVIDENCE THAT THE FBI IS WILLING TO KILL HIM AND EVERYONE WITH HIM. COOPER HAS BEEN WITH THE BUNDYS AT LEAST SINCE CLIVEN??S STANDOFF IN NEVADA IN 2014. HE??S A MEMBER OF AN ARIZONA MILITIA AND HAS CALLED FOR THE IMPEACHMENT OF JOHN MCCAIN. DAVID FRY WHO IS USUALLY FOUND WORKING ON WEBSITES AND VIDEO EDITING IS SPENDING HIS MORNING AT THE REFUGE WRAPPED IN A BLANKET CLUTCHING A RIFLE WITH BRIGHTLY COLORED CONFEDERATE FLAGS ON IT. FRY STAVES OFF THE BOREDOM OF WATCH TRYING TO IDENTIFY SHELL CASINGS. HE ISN??T A WEAPONS GUY BUT SOMEONE??S GIVEN HIM ONE ANYWAY. ??YOU USUALLY GET TO CHOOSE WHAT KIND OF WEAPONS YOU GET IN VIDEO GAMES? HE SAYS. TODAY ON THE REFUGE MILITANTS ARE CONSTRUCTING FIREBREAKS AND DIGGING DITCHES AROUND THEIR PERIMETER. THEY SPEAK ABOUT LAVOY??S FAMILY AND THEIR OWN. EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THAT THE STAKES HAVE JUST BECOME A BIT HEAVIER. IT??S NOT A QUESTION OF WHEN ANYMORE IT??S A QUESTION OF HOW. FINICUM IS MISSING FROM HIS USUAL PLACES ON THE REFUGE AND EVERYONE NOTICES. FINICUM 55 WAS A LEADER AND SPOKESPERSON FOR THE BUNDYS AND THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. HE WAS EVERYWHERE IN THE REFUGE BRINGING FOOD OR BEING WHAT HE CONSIDERED TO BE GENERALLY HELPFUL. WHEN I LEFT THE REFUGE HE SHOOK MY HAND AND THANKED ME FOR COMING DOWN PERSONALLY TO THE PLACE TO REPORT INSTEAD OF JUST WATCHING CNN. ??I DON??T CARE WHAT KIND OF STORY YOU WRITE? HE TOLD ME ??JUST SO LONG AS IT??S FAIR.? THE SHOOTING DEATH OF FINICUM SENT A WAVE OF MYRIAD REACTION THROUGH LOCALS. SOME HAVE TAKEN TO GLEEFUL REACTIONS SOME ARE SAD IT CAME TO THIS. KRISTIE POTTER-DAVIS A RANCHER WHO LIVES NEAR MALHEUR AND HAD THEREFORE BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH FINICUM ASKED SOMEONE TO TONE IT DOWN ON FACEBOOK BECAUSE SHE??D JUST LOST A FRIEND. ??I??VE JUST LOST AN ENEMY SO SHUT UP? CAME THE QUICK REJOINDER. NOBODY IN THE REFUGE WOULD HAVE BELIEVED THAT FINICUM WOULD FIRE THE FIRST SHOT BUT NOBODY THAT??S EVER SPOKEN TO HIM COULD DOUBT THAT HE WAS DETERMINED NOT TO BE ARRESTED. AMMON BUNDY TOLD HIS WIFE ON THE PHONE PEOPLE WROTE ON FACEBOOK THAT FINICUM WAS LYING PRONE WITH HIS HANDS EXTENDED WHEN HE WAS KILLED. OTHER REPORTS HAVE HIM CHARGING AT POLICE. IT??S IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW WHAT REALLY HAPPENED. IN THE END THE ARRESTS AND KILLING CHANGED NOTHING. THE FBI CREATED A MARTYR FOR MILITIAMEN NATIONWIDE AND TURNED AMMON AND RYAN BUNDY INTO HEROES FOR THE SORT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE SO ALIENATED AND ANGRY THEY THINK THAT ARMED RESISTANCE IS THE ONLY REMAINING OPTION. THOSE PEOPLE WILL IF GIVEN ENOUGH TIME MAKE THEIR WAY TO MALHEUR. IT COULD HAVE BEEN CALLED AN OCCUPATION BEFORE STRICTLY SPEAKING. NOW THERE??S NO DOUBT IT??S A STANDOFF. THE ONLY THING IN QUESTION IS WHETHER MORE PEOPLE WILL DIE. ,26250.0

39,9558473.0,2016-01-02T06:01:00+00:00,HOW FAMOUS PAINTINGS GOT THEIR (WRONG) NAMES,I SOMETIMES THINK THAT EVERY MUSEUM LABEL SHOULD CARRY A DISCLAIMER: ??WARNING. THE TITLE YOU ARE ABOUT TO READ MAY TELL YOU MORE ABOUT THE HISTORICAL RECEPTION OF THE PAINTING THAN IT DOES ABOUT THE PAINTING ITSELF.? GOOGLE ??REMBRANDT? AND ??PHILOSOPHER? FOR INSTANCE AND THE FIRST THING YOU WILL SEE ON YOUR SCREEN IS THE IMAGE OF A PAINTING THAT NOW HANGS IN THE LOUVRE. THE PAINTING WHICH IS TITLED PHILOSOPHE EN M??DITATION (PHILOSOPHER IN MEDITATION) AND DATED 1632 SHOWS AN OLD BEARDED MAN SEATED IN AN INTERIOR WITH A LARGE OPEN BOOK ON THE TABLE BESIDE HIM. GOLDEN LIGHT FROM A WINDOW ILLUMINATES HIS FIGURE WHILE THE REST OF THE INTERIOR IS PLUNGED IN SHADOWS. TO HIS RIGHT IS A WINDING STAIR THAT DISAPPEARS INTO A DARK RECESS AND THE BENT FORM OF AN OLD WOMAN TENDING A FIRE. THOUGH YOU WON??T BE ABLE TO SEE IT ON THE SCREEN THE INDISTINCT FORM OF ANOTHER WOMAN IS ALSO DISAPPEARING UP THE STAIR. EVER SINCE THIS PAINTING ARRIVED AT THE LOUVRE AT THE END OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY COMMENTATORS HAVE BEEN TEMPTED TO ASSOCIATE ITS ??PHILOSOPHE? WITH THE CONTEMPLATIVE ARTIST WHO CREATED HIM. ONE NINETEENTH-CENTURY FRENCH POET SIMPLY DECIDED THAT REMBRANDT WAS THE PHILOSOPHER. ANOTHER SAW ??THE VERY GENIUS OF REMBRANDT? IN THE FIGURE AND ATTRIBUTED THE PICTURE AS A WHOLE TO THE ARTIST??S WISH FOR ??AN INTERIOR IN WHICH TO HOUSE HIS MYSTERIOUS THOUGHT.? IN THE MID-TWENTIETH CENTURY THE WRITER AND PHILOSOPHER ALDOUS HUXLEY DESCRIBED THE PAINTING??S ??SYMBOLICAL SUBJECT MATTER? AS ??NOTHING MORE NOR LESS THAN THE HUMAN MIND? ITSELF. REMBRANDT HOWEVER HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH NAMING HIS PICTURE. LIKE MANY PAINTINGS FROM THE DUTCH GOLDEN AGE THIS ONE OWES ITS TITLE TO A REPRODUCTIVE PRINTMAKER WHO ENGRAVED THE IMAGE FOR POPULAR CONSUMPTION MORE THAN A CENTURY AFTER THE ARTIST PAINTED IT. THIS PARTICULAR PRINTMAKER MAY IN TURN HAVE TAKEN HIS CUE FROM A FRENCH OWNER OF THE PAINTING WHO WAS ALREADY CALLING IT AND A COMPANION PIECE (THEN ALSO ATTRIBUTED TO REMBRANDT) HIS ??DEUX PHILOSOPHES? SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE BOTH PICTURES WERE ENGRAVED IN 1753-54. ONCE THE PRINT BEGAN TO CIRCULATE THE TITLE STUCK TO THE PAINTING TOO. BUT THE PHILOSOPHER THESE MEN THOUGHT THEY SAW IN REMBRANDT??S PICTURE IS ALMOST CERTAINLY THEIR INVENTION??A PRODUCT OF THEIR OWN ENLIGHTENMENT ERA WHEN ??PHILOSOPHES? FLOURISHED RATHER THAN THE CREATION OF THE ARTIST. AMONG OTHER REASONS FOR DOUBTING THE TITLE I AM SORRY TO REPORT IS THAT WOMAN BENDING OVER THE FIRE: THERE IS APPARENTLY NO ICONOGRAPHICAL TRADITION OF PHILOSOPHERS ACCOMPANIED BY WOMEN! ?ŸTHOUGH HER PRESENCE HAS PROMPTED ONE KNOWLEDGEABLE COMMENTATOR TO ASSOCIATE THE PICTURE WITH THE RELATIVELY OBSCURE BIBLICAL STORY OF TOBIT AND HIS WIFE ANNA THE EXACT SUBJECT OF REMBRANDT??S PAINTING REMAINS A MYSTERY. MEANWHILE IT CONTINUES TO BE KNOWN??AND THEREFORE GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD??AS HIS PHILOSOPHER IN MEDITATION. WE ARE PROBABLY INDEBTED TO THE PRINTMAKERS FOR THE IDEA THAT A PICTURE SHOULD HAVE A TITLE IN THE FIRST PLACE. AMONG THE MOST SUCCESSFUL OF THESE REPRODUCTIVE ARTISTS WAS A GERMAN ENGRAVER BASED IN PARIS NAMED JEAN GEORGES WILLE (1715-1808) WHOSE MAGNIFICENT PRINTS CIRCULATED THROUGHOUT EUROPE IN THE LATE EIGHTEENTH AND NINETEENTH CENTURIES. WILLE EARNED PARTICULAR FAME FOR HIS REPRODUCTIONS OF SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY DUTCH GENRE PAINTINGS??THOSE PICTURES OF EVERYDAY LIFE THAT STILL DRAW CROWDS TO MODERN MUSEUMS??AND PERHAPS HIS MOST CELEBRATED IMAGE WAS A PRINT AFTER GERARD TER BORCH THAT HE CALLED L??INSTRUCTION PATERNELLE (1765) OR THE PATERNAL ADMONITION AS IT IS USUALLY TRANSLATED IN ENGLISH. (WE KNOW THAT THIS TITLE WAS WILLE??S RATHER THAN THE PAINTER??S FROM A DIARY KEPT BY THE PRINTMAKER.) SO FAMOUS DID THIS PARTICULAR PRINT BECOME THAT A HALF-CENTURY LATER GOETHE WAS STILL INQUIRING RHETORICALLY ??WHO DOES NOT KNOW WILLE??S MAGNIFICENT COPPER ENGRAVING OF THIS PAINTING?? TER BORCH??S PICTURE SHOWS THREE FIGURES IN AN INTERIOR: A YOUNG WOMAN DRESSED IN WHITE SATIN AND STANDING WITH HER BACK TO US A SEATED MAN WHO RAISES HIS HAND IN A GESTURE THAT WILLE APPARENTLY TOOK AS A SIGN OF WARNING OR CORRECTION AND AN OLDER WOMAN ALSO SEATED WHO FACES THE VIEWER AS SHE SIPS FROM A WINE GLASS. THE PICTURE WAS PAINTED AROUND 1654-55 WILLE ENGRAVED AND TITLED IT MORE THAN A CENTURY LATER. AND SO SUGGESTIVE DID THAT TITLE PROVE THAT GOETHE COULD SPIN AN ENTIRE SMALL NARRATIVE FROM ITS CUES. IN ONE OF HIS OWN MOST IMPORTANT WORKS THE 1809 NOVEL ELECTIVE AFFINITIES GOETHE??S CHARACTERS ACT OUT A TABLEAU VIVANT BASED ON WILLE??S PRINT: A NOBLE KNIGHT SITS WITH CROSSED FEET EVIDENTLY SEVERELY LECTURING HIS DAUGHTER WHO FACES HIM?? [S]HE CAN ONLY BE SEEN FROM THE BACK BUT HER WHOLE POSTURE SEEMS TO INDICATE THAT SHE IS CONTROLLING HERSELF. THE EXPRESSION AND GESTURE OF THE FATHER TELLS US HOWEVER THAT HIS REPROOF IS NOT TOO VIOLENT OR HUMILIATING AND THE MOTHER SEEMS TO HIDE A SLIGHT EMBARRASSMENT WHILE SHE GAZES INTO THE GLASS OF WINE SHE IS ABOUT TO SIP. THIS LITTLE STORY HAD ITS OWN AFTERLIFE. WHEN THE FUTURE NOVELIST GEORGE ELIOT TOURED THE BERLIN MUSEUM IN 1854 SHE RECORDED IN HER JOURNAL HOW ??PLEASED? SHE WAS TO ??RECOGNIZE AMONG THE PICTURES? THE ONE GOETHE HAD DESCRIBED IN HIS NOVEL: ??IT IS THE DAUGHTER BEING REPROVED BY HER FATHER WHILE THE MOTHER IS EMPTYING HER WINE GLASS.? SHE WAS LOOKING AT THE BERLIN ORIGINAL BUT HER MEMORY FOR ITS TITULAR NARRATIVE WAS EVIDENTLY STRONGER THAN HER RECALL OF THE PAINTER HIMSELF SINCE THE SAME JOURNAL ENTRY ATTRIBUTES THE PICTURE IN QUESTION TO ANOTHER DUTCH ARTIST JAN STEEN. THE TROUBLE OF COURSE IS THAT WE HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING WHETHER TER BORCH HAD ANYTHING LIKE WILLE??S INSTRUCTIVE SCENARIO IN MIND. THE PAINTING EXISTS IN TWO VERSIONS??THE ONE IN BERLIN AND ANOTHER AT THE RIJKSMUSEUM IN AMSTERDAM. BY THE MIDDLE OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY THE SCHOLARLY CONSENSUS HAD SHIFTED THE SCENE FROM A DOMESTIC INTERIOR TO AN UPSCALE BROTHEL AS THE STANDING FIGURE MORPHED INTO A COURTESAN WHILE HER ERSTWHILE PARENTS TURNED RESPECTIVELY INTO A WOULD-BE CLIENT AND HIS WINE-SIPPING PROCURESS. THIS MORE SALACIOUS READING APPEARED TO RECEIVE FURTHER REINFORCEMENT WHEN THE CLEANING OF THE BERLIN PICTURE REVEALED TO SOME EYES THE TRACES OF A COIN IN THE GENTLEMAN??S HAND. RATHER THAN A GESTURE OF ADMONITION THE HAND WAS APPARENTLY ENGAGED IN OFFERING PAYMENT FOR SEXUAL SERVICES ABOUT TO BE RENDERED. SO MUCH IT WOULD SEEM FOR WILLE??S EDIFYING IMAGE OF FAMILY LIFE IN THE DUTCH GOLDEN AGE! UNHAPPILY FOR THE BROTHEL THEORY HOWEVER THAT COIN HAS SINCE BEEN PRONOUNCED A PHANTOM. RECENT COMMENTATORS ON THE PAINTING GENERALLY AGREE THAT THE ORIGINAL MEANING OF THE SCENE REMAINS ELUSIVE BUT MUSEUMS AND CATALOGS STILL REQUIRE A TITLE. WHEN I LAST CHECKED THE RIJKSMUSEUM HAD CHOSEN TO CALL ITS VERSION THE GALLANT CONVERSATION FOLLOWED IN PARENTHESES BY THE PHRASE ??KNOWN AS THE PATERNAL ADMONITION.? AT BERLIN THE PICTURE CONTINUED TO GO BY THE NAME WILLE GAVE IT. BY THE NINETEENTH CENTURY MOST VIEWERS SEEM TO HAVE TAKEN FOR GRANTED BOTH THAT PAINTINGS HAD TITLES AND THAT ARTISTS SUPPLIED THEM. YET THEN AS NOW MANY PAINTERS CONTINUED TO LEAVE THE NAMING OF THEIR WORK TO OTHERS. WE STILL DON??T KNOW WHETHER ANY OF PAUL C??ZANNE??S TITLES FOR EXAMPLE ORIGINATED WITH THE ARTIST. HIS INFLUENTIAL DEALER AMBROISE VOLLARD TELLS AN AMUSING STORY OF ONE EARLY PICTURE A LANDSCAPE WITH SOME FEMALE NUDES AND ??A PERSON WHO FROM HIS GETUP COULD BE TAKEN FOR A SHEPHERD.? IN THE COURSE OF ARRANGING FOR A SHOW HE ACCIDENTALLY PLACED THE CANVAS IN A FRAME THAT STILL BORE THE LEGEND FROM A PREVIOUS PICTURE. C??ZANNE??S PAINTING WAS THUS INADVERTENTLY BAPTIZED DIANA AND ACTEON??AND INTERPRETED ACCORDINGLY. ONE CRITIC EVEN PRAISED ??THE NOBILITY OF THE GODDESS??S ATTITUDE AND THE MODEST AIR OF THE VIRGINS WHO SURROUNDED HER? AS THE CHASTE COMPANY INDIGNANTLY REPELLED THE SPYING ACTEON. SOMETIME LATER THE SAME DEALER WAS ASKED TO LEND A TEMPTATION OF SAINT ANTHONY BY C??ZANNE TO ANOTHER EXHIBIT. UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE EXHIBITERS THE PAINTING VOLLARD HAD PROMISED THEM HAD BEEN SOLD IN THE INTERIM. BUT HE STILL HAD CUSTODY OF THE OTHER PICTURE WHICH HE MISCHIEVOUSLY SENT ON INSTEAD. THIS TIME THERE WERE NO WORDS ON THE FRAME BUT SINCE THE EXHIBITERS WERE EXPECTING A TEMPTATION OF SAINT ANTHONY THAT??S HOW IT WAS LISTED IN THE CATALOG. WHERE ONE CRITIC HAD SEEN THE CHASTE DIANA ANOTHER NOW SPOTTED ??THE SMILE AT ONCE BEWITCHING AND PERFIDIOUS OF A DAUGHTER OF SATAN? THE INDIGNANT GESTURE OF THE GODDESS??S ATTENDANT NOW TURNED INTO ??A SEDUCTIVE INVITATION? WHILE ??THE PSEUDO- ACTEON? BECAME A ??MOVING SAINT ANTHONY.? A COLLECTOR WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY REFUSED THE SUPPOSED DIANA AND ACTEON BECAUSE HE ALREADY OWNED A PAINTING OF THE SUBJECT BY ANOTHER ARTIST NOW TRIUMPHANTLY ANNOUNCED HIS PURCHASE OF THE REJECTED CANVAS UNDER ITS NEW NAME. ??IT HAS A STRIKING REALISM!? HE BOASTED. C??ZANNE HIMSELF ON THE OTHER HAND DENIED THAT HIS PAINTING HAD ANY SUBJECT AT ALL. ??I MERELY TRIED TO RENDER CERTAIN MOVEMENTS? THE ARTIST PROTESTED WHEN HE LEARNED OF THESE TITULAR ADVENTURES. READING BY THE TITLE AS I CALL THIS PROCESS OF SEEING WHAT IT TELLS YOU TO SEE IS NOT LIMITED TO PICTURES OF THE HUMAN FIGURE. ONE OF MY FAVORITE STORIES CONCERNS AN ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONIST PAINTING BY JACKSON POLLOCK THAT NOW HANGS IN THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART IN NEW YORK. THE PAINTING IS ENTITLED PASIPHA?® (1943) AFTER THE MYTHICAL QUEEN WHO CUCKOLDED KING MINOS WITH A BULL AND GAVE BIRTH TO THE MINOTAUR. TAKING HIS CUE FROM THE TITLE A FUTURE DIRECTOR OF PAINTING AND SCULPTURE AT MOMA ASSOCIATED THE PAINTING??S ??ENERGETIC MOTIFS? WITH ??SEXUAL ABANDON? ??PHYSICAL ECSTASY? AND ??ANIMAL PASSION.? THE POET AND ART CRITIC FRANK O??HARA IDENTIFIED THE PICTURE WITH ??THE AMOROUS NATURE OF BESTIALITY? AND SAW IN IT ??THE STARK STARING AND FOREBODING FIGURE OF PASIPHA?®?? WITH HER FOREKNOWLEDGE OF THE MINOTAUR AND HER LUST.? BUT WHAT ARE WE TO MAKE OF SUCH VISIONS ONCE WE LEARN THAT ??PASIPHA?®? WAS NOT POLLOCK??S TITLE AT ALL BUT THE BELATED SUGGESTION OF A CURATOR AT MOMA WHO OFFERED IT AS A SUBSTITUTE WHEN THE ARTIST??S PATRON PEGGY GUGGENHEIM OBJECTED TO HIS ORIGINAL CHOICE OF ??MOBY-DICK?? ??WHO THE HELL IS PASIPHA?®?? POLLOCK IS SAID TO HAVE RESPONDED AND MANY VIEWERS MAY STILL SHARE HIS BEWILDERMENT. YET POLLOCK ALSO ACCEPTED THE TITLE AND FOR MORE THAN A HALF-CENTURY HIS CANVAS HAS CONTINUED TO BE KNOWN AS PASIPHA?®. AT WHAT POINT IF ANY MIGHT THOSE OF US WITH A TASTE FOR ANCIENT MYTH BE JUSTIFIED IN THINKING OF THE LUSTFUL QUEEN WHEN WE LOOK AT HIS PAINTING?

1051,10210607.0,2016-01-23T05:02:00+00:00,WHY HE CAN??T PART WITH HIS $40K GUITAR,THE M2K IS UNLIKE ANY GUITAR YOU??VE EVER SEEN. LET??S START WITH THE MATERIALS. ITS SIDES AND BACK ARE MADE ENTIRELY OF RARE AFRICAN EBONY. IT??S GOT GORGEOUS BEARCLAW SITKA SPRUCE FROM VANCOUVER ISLAND ON TOP. FLAMED SOUTH AMERICAN MAHOGANY FOR THE NECK. BINDING MADE FROM HAWAIIAN CURLY KOA. AND A NUT AND SADDLE CARVED OUT OF IVORY FROM A FOSSILIZED MAMMOTH TUSK. OR HOW ABOUT THE DESIGN? COVERING THE BACK OF THE M2K AND SPILLING AROUND TO THE FRETBOARD IS AN IMPOSSIBLY ORNATE MURAL FEATURING A MENAGERIE OF ELEPHANTS MONKEYS BUSHY TREES A MARCHING BAND IN MID-SONG AND A WINDING RIVER COMPLETE WITH WATERFALL??ALL OF WHICH IS PAINSTAKINGLY BROUGHT TO LIFE BY MORE THAN 200 HAND-CUT PIECES OF MOTHER OF PEARL AND ABALONE. IN THE RIGHT LIGHT THE ENTIRE BACK OF THE GUITAR GLITTERS. NO MATTER HOW YOU SLICE IT THE M2K IS A WHOLLY UNIQUE 1/1 GUITAR THAT TOOK YEARS TO BUILD AND THAT WILL NEVER EXIST AGAIN. AND IT??S FOR SALE. I THINK. THE BRAIN BEHIND THIS MUSICAL MARVEL IS 63-YEAR-OLD CANADIAN DAVID IANNONE. IT ALL STARTED BACK IN 2007 WHEN HE REALIZED HIS ONE-MAN SHOP MORGAN GUITARS WAS FAST APPROACHING ITS 2000TH GUITAR. IANNONE STARTED BUILDING GUITARS IN THE EARLY ??80S AS AN APPRENTICE UNDER LEGENDARY BUILDER JEAN LARRIV??E (WHOSE HANDIWORK YOU MAY RECOGNIZE FROM THE VIDEO FOR ASTRONAUT CHRIS HADFIELD??S 2013 COVER OF ??SPACE ODDITY? PERFORMED ABOARD THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION). IN 1985 IANNONE DECIDED TO MAKE A GO OF IT HIMSELF AND HE??S SPENT HIS DAYS IN HAPPY SOLITUDE EVER SINCE BUILDING HANDCRAFTED ACOUSTIC GUITARS OUT OF THE MULTI-CHAMBERED CUSTOM-BUILT STUDIO ATTACHED TO HIS NORTH VANCOUVER HOME. OVER THE YEARS IANNONE HAS BUILT GUITARS FOR LOCAL STARS AND ENTHUSIASTIC AMATEURS ALIKE. THE BLUES MUSICIAN JIM BYRNES AND FOLK-ROCK BAND SPIRIT OF THE WEST BOTH USE MORGAN GUITARS SO DOES SARAH MCLACHLAN. AND AS IANNONE??S REPUTATION HAS SPREAD SO TOO HAVE HIS INSTRUMENTS. TODAY HE HAS DEALERS IN GERMANY JAPAN SOUTH KOREA AND THE NETHERLANDS AND INDIVIDUAL BUYERS COME THROUGH HIS WEBSITE FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD. THE INTERNET IANNONE ACKNOWLEDGES HAS LED TO A SURGE OF START-UP GUITAR BUILDERS AS FORMERLY CLOSELY GUARDED INFORMATION ON TECHNIQUES AND MATERIALS IS NOW ALL IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN. BUT HE DISTINGUISHES HIMSELF IN ONE KEY WAY: ??YOU CAN??T BUY EXPERIENCE? IANNONE SAYS. ??AND I??VE GOT A HELL OF A LOT OF IT.? IT??S BECOME UNOFFICIAL TRADITION FOR IANNONE TO BUILD SPECIAL CUSTOM GUITARS TO MARK MILESTONES IN HIS CAREER. TO CELEBRATE MORGAN??S 20TH ANNIVERSARY THERE WAS A SET OF TEN GUITARS MADE OF QUILTED SAPELE WITH BEARCLAW SPRUCE TOPS. FOR LAST YEAR??S 30TH IANNONE MADE A SPECIAL ONE-TIME PIECE FEATURING AN IMAGE OF MORGAN HORSES??ONE OF THE INSPIRATIONS FOR THE COMPANY NAME??SCRIMSHAWED DIRECTLY ONTO A PIECE OF INLAID SHELL ON THE HEADSTOCK. THE M2K HOWEVER IS ON A WHOLE DIFFERENT LEVEL. IANNONE STARTED PLANNING FOR IT YEARS BEFORE GUITAR NUMBER 2000 WAS ACTUALLY READY TO BE BUILT. HE SQUIRRELED AWAY ESPECIALLY RARE MATERIALS AS HE FOUND THEM AND SPENT MONTHS GOING BACK AND FORTH WITH HIS LONG-TIME ARTISTIC COLLABORATOR PATRICK POTHIER FINE-TUNING EVERY ELEMENT OF THE DESIGN. POTHIER HIMSELF ACTUALLY APPEARS IN THE FINAL MURAL AS DOES IANNONE??THE FORMER HELPING HIS WIFE STEP OUT OF A DORY THE LATTER ENTERTAINING A MONKEY SITTING ON HIS WORKBENCH. THE PROCESS DIDN??T GET ANY EASIER WHEN IT WAS TIME TO ACTUALLY PUT IT ALL TOGETHER. IANNONE WENT THROUGH 200 SAW BLADES CUTTING THE REQUISITE AMOUNT OF PEARL. ONCE CUT EACH PIECE WAS THEN NUMBERED AND STORED IN ONE OF MANY CAREFULLY LABELLED ENVELOPES. ??IT??S LIKE A HOUSE: IF YOU DON??T SPEND PROPER TIME ON THE FOUNDATION YOU??RE ASKING FOR TROUBLE? IANNONE SAYS. ??BUT THIS WAS SO WELL DESIGNED. WE TOOK OUR TIME.? TO HELP TAKE THE PRESSURE OFF HE ONLY ALLOWED HIMSELF TO WORK ON THIS MASSIVE ANNIVERSARY PROJECT OUTSIDE OF REGULAR BUSINESS HOURS. ??I FELT LIKE MY LABOUR WAS FREE AFTER DINNER.? FINALLY AFTER TWO YEARS OF BURNING THE MIDNIGHT OIL THE M2K WAS FINISHED IN 2009. THE ASKING RETAIL PRICE? FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS CANADIAN (APPROXIMATELY $27000 USD). TO BE FAIR THERE ARE MORE EXPENSIVE GUITARS OUT THERE. IN FACT JUST LAST YEAR GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS OFFICIALLY BESTOWED THAT HONOUR ON A WHITE DIAMOND-ENCRUSTED GIBSON SG VALUED AT SOME $2 MILLION USD. BUT IT??S THE M2K??S COMBINATION OF RARE AND VALUABLE MATERIALS ITS OBSESSIVE ATTENTION TO DETAIL AND THE FACT THAT IT??S A ONE-OFF PIECE??NOT PART OF A LARGER RUN??THAT REALLY ELEVATES IT TO A CLASS OF ITS OWN. DESPITE ALL THE EXTRA WORK THAT GOES INTO THEM IANNONE SELLS EACH OF HIS MILESTONE GUITARS JUST LIKE ANY OTHER??THESE ONES TO COLLECTORS TYPICALLY. FOR IANNONE THE PROCESS OF CREATION IS WHAT REALLY MATTERS. EVERYTHING AFTER THAT IS OUT OF HIS HANDS. ??IF YOU PAINT A PAINTING YOU SELL IT AND WHAT HAPPENS HAPPENS? HE SAYS BY WAY OF COMPARISON. ??SOME OF THEM ARE PRESERVED FOREVER AND SOME GET LOST IN A FIRE. ONCE THEY??RE OUT OF YOUR SPACE THEY??RE GONE.? STILL THINGS ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT WITH THE M2K. DESPITE BEING FINISHED AND READY TO GO IT HAS SAT IN IANNONE??S STUDIO FOR THE PAST SEVEN YEARS UNTOUCHED ON A STORAGE RACK INSIDE A NONDESCRIPT CASE. AND NOT FOR LACK OF INTEREST EITHER: IANNONE SAYS HE??S HAD SEVERAL OFFERS OVER THE YEARS BUT FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER THEY??VE ALL FALLEN THROUGH. FOR A WHILE IT WAS ON DISPLAY IN A GLASS CASE IN A LOCAL VANCOUVER GUITAR STORE WHICH BRIEFLY CAUGHT THE EYE OF A LOCAL COLLECTOR. TODAY THE M2K IS LISTED ON THE MORGAN GUITARS WEBSITE BUT WITHOUT MUCH FANFARE NEXT TO A BUNCH OF OTHER FAR CHEAPER MODELS. IT COMES DOWN TO THIS: AFTER SPENDING SO MANY HOURS ON THE M2K SLAVING OVER EVERY TINY DETAIL IANNONE FINDS HIMSELF RELUCTANT TO SELL IT. IN A WAY IT??S HARD TO BLAME HIM. HE WANTS TO MAKE SURE THE GUITAR WILL GO TO A HOME WHERE IT WILL BE TAKEN CARE OF AND APPRECIATED BUT WHO COULD POSSIBLY APPRECIATE THE M2K AS MUCH AS ITS CREATOR DOES? WHO ELSE COULD SPOT ALL THE MINUTE REFERENCES OR UNDERSTAND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT LITTLE PEARL IANNONE FIGURE HANDING A BALL??OR IS IT A PIECE OF FOOD??TO THE MONKEY PERCHED ON HIS WORKBENCH? ON THOSE RARE OCCASIONS IANNONE DOES TAKE THE M2K OUT OF ITS CASE EVEN HE STILL SEEMS AMAZED THAT IT EXISTS AT ALL. ??NOW I LOOK IT AND GO ??I DON??T KNOW HOW I EVER DID THIS??? HE SAYS. ??I CAN??T IMAGINE DOING IT AGAIN. THE AMOUNT OF WORK THE FOCUS ON THIS PIECE??I THINK IT??S PROBABLY MY MASTERPIECE.? BUT IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED HE SAYS HE??S STILL TAKING OFFERS. IN THE MEANTIME THERE ARE ALWAYS MORE GUITARS TO BUILD. IN FACT IANNONE WORKS AT SUCH A CLIP THAT HE??S ALREADY FAST APPROACHING HIS 2500TH GUITAR: ANOTHER MILESTONE TO BE COMMEMORATED WITH ANOTHER SPECIAL PROJECT. RIGHT NOW HE??S STILL SKETCHING IDEAS FOR THE ARTWORK. FOR THAT ONE IANNONE??S THINKING GEESE. MICHAEL HINGSTON IS A WRITER AND NOVELIST BASED IN EDMONTON ALBERTA CANADA.

NO LOCAL PRESS WAS ON THE SCENE. PASSERS-BY WHO STOPPED TO SNOOP OR TAKE PICTURES WITH THEIR SMARTPHONES WERE ESCORTED AWAY BY POLICE. LATER THAT EVENING THERE WAS NO MENTION OF THE INCIDENT ON THE REGULAR NEWS BROADCAST. ENQUIRIES BY PHONE WITH THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION THE NEXT DAY WERE MET WITH FEIGNED OR REAL IGNORANCE. OFFICIALLY THE TEACHERS WERE NEVER THERE. ACROSS CHINA SMALL-SCALE PROTESTS WITH DOZENS OR A FEW HUNDRED PEOPLE IN ATTENDANCE TAKE PLACE FREQUENTLY. THEY MAY NOT HAVE THE STAYING POWER OF LAST YEAR??S UMBRELLA MOVEMENT IN HONG KONG OR THE INTENSITY OF THE ANTI-JAPAN RIOTS FROM THREE YEARS AGO BUT THEY HAPPEN JUST ABOUT EVERY DAY AND THEY??RE NOT ABOUT TO GO AWAY. SHANGHAI SHAOXING YANJIAO BAOJI HUAZHOU JINLING??THESE ARE JUST A FEW CITIES AND TOWNS WHERE PROTESTS TOOK PLACE OVER ONE WEEKEND IN NOVEMBER. MORE RECENTLY ON JAN. 1 THERE WERE DEMONSTRATIONS IN BEIJING NANCHANG NANJING HANGZHOU WUHAN CHANGDE AND DALIAN. IN GENERAL THE PROTESTERS?? MOTIVATIONS ARE NOT POLITICAL. MOST OF THE TIME THEY ARE FROM MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES AND HAVE BEEN WRONGED SOMEHOW. SOME ARE RESIDENTS WHO FACE EVICTIONS THEIR HOUSES ABOUT TO BE KNOCKED DOWN SO THE GOVERNMENT CAN BUILD HIGHWAYS OR PROPERTY DEVELOPERS CAN ERECT NEW RESIDENTIAL TOWERS. OTHERS ARE HOMEBUYERS WHO HAVE BEEN CONNED BY SHADY PROPERTY DEVELOPERS THEIR APARTMENT COMPLEXES PARTIALLY BUILT AND THEN ABANDONED BY CONSTRUCTION CREWS. VILLAGERS MAY TAKE ISSUE WITH PLANS FOR FACTORIES WITH TOXIC EMISSIONS. THEIR REASONS MATTER LITTLE TO LOCAL OFFICIALS. POLICE ARE ALWAYS READY TO DISPERSE THEM WHICH MEANS BEATINGS FOLLOWED BY ARRESTS. IN A SEPTEMBER POLL BY THE PEW RESEARCH CENTER THE CHINESE PUBLIC CITED CORRUPT OFFICIALS AS THEIR TOP CONCERN WITH 84 PERCENT VIEWING THEM AS A BIG PROBLEM. PARTICIPANTS IN THE SURVEY WERE ALSO WORRIED ABOUT CHINA??S ENVIRONMENT SPECIFICALLY THE QUALITY OF THE AIR AND WATER. EVEN THOUGH THE CHINESE PUBLIC IS ENJOYING A HIGHER STANDARD OF LIVING THOSE POLLED ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE COUNTRY??S ECONOMIC GROWTH HAS PRODUCED MANY NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES THAT DEEPLY AFFECT THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE. THESE WORRIES ARE WELL-FOUNDED. BERKELEY EARTH A TEAM OF CLIMATE SCIENTISTS AND ANALYSTS CALCULATES THAT AIR POLLUTION CONTRIBUTES TO 1.6 MILLION DEATHS IN CHINA EACH YEAR. FORCED EVICTIONS IN WUKAN GUANGDONG PROVINCE LED TO THE EXPULSION OF COMMUNIST PARTY OFFICIALS FROM THE VILLAGE IN DECEMBER 2011 A SUBSEQUENT SIEGE BY UP TO A THOUSAND POLICE OFFICERS AND A VILLAGE REPRESENTATIVE DYING IN POLICE CUSTODY UNDER DUBIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES. LAST AUGUST THE SAME ISSUE LED TO MULTIPLE INJURIES AND POSSIBLY TWO DEATHS IN JICUN GUANGXI. SINCE CONFIDENCE IN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ISN??T STRONG AS THE PEW RESEARCH CENTER REPORT REFLECTS ARBITRATION ISN??T ALWAYS SEEN AS THE PRIME METHOD OF RECOURSE. TO THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT THIS NIGGLING FORM OF DISSENT IS EASY FOR THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO QUELL. CHINESE CITIZENS WHO PARTICIPATE IN LITTLE ACTS OF PUBLIC DISOBEDIENCE USUALLY AREN??T AS ORGANIZED AS THE VILLAGERS OF WUKAN. THEIR LIMITED SCOPE OF ACTION MEANS THE POLICE ARE ABLE TO SUPPRESS PUBLIC OUTCRY WITH COLD EFFICIENCY. A SUBMISSIVE CHINESE MEDIA AND ADAPTIVE INTERNET CENSORSHIP APPARATUS ENSURE THE NEWS WON??T TRAVEL FAR IF AT ALL. LABOR DISPUTES AND GRASSROOTS PROTESTS HAVE SWELLED AS CHINESE LEADERS FACE A SLOWING ECONOMY. LAYOFFS WITH UNPAID WAGES OR ABSENT COMPENSATION AS WELL AS STATE-ORDERED EVICTIONS REMAIN CONSTANT. A STRIKE MAP COMPILED BY THE HONG KONG-BASED CHINA LABOR BULLETIN INDICATES GUANGDONG PROVINCE IN THE SOUTHEAST WHERE MANY MULTINATIONAL CHINESE CORPORATIONS HAVE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IS THE EPICENTER OF PUBLIC ACTION THOUGH RECORDED INCIDENTS BLANKET THE EASTERN HALF OF THE COUNTRY. LABOR DISPUTES ALONE ACCOUNTED FOR 569 INCIDENTS IN THE FINAL QUARTER OF 2014. IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2015 1498 INCIDENTS STEMMING FROM LABOR DISPUTES WERE LOGGED ON THE MAP. IT'S HARD TO SAY EXACTLY HOW MANY PROTESTS THERE HAVE BEEN IN TOTAL IN THE SAME PERIOD. THE DATA IS FUZZY. IF THE PAST IS AN INDICATOR THERE COULD HAVE BEEN ANYWHERE FROM 163 TO 180000 MASS INCIDENTS IN 2010. (THE LOWER FIGURE IS UNSURPRISINGLY OFFERED BY THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY'S ENGLISH-LANGUAGE MOUTHPIECE.) MANY OF THESE PROTESTS TAKE PLACE IN SMALLER TOWNS OR VILLAGES AWAY FROM THE METROPOLISES THAT RECEIVE MUCH MORE ATTENTION IN CHINESE NEWS. WHILE VIDEO CLIPS OF THESE INCIDENTS ARE EASILY UPLOADED AND SHARED ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS LIKE WECHAT OR WEIBO THE POSTS ONLY ENJOY BRIEF HEAT BEFORE CENSORS SPOT AND REMOVE THEM. CHINESE PRESIDENT XI JINPING WANTS TO CLEAN UP CHINA BOTH LITERALLY AND FIGURATIVELY. HE IS AN INCREDIBLY POPULAR LEADER WITH MANY CITIZENS PLACING THEIR FAITH IN HIS TRUMPETED DOMESTIC POLICIES TO IMPROVE THEIR LIVELIHOODS. WHILE THE CHINESE PUBLIC GENERALLY VIEWS XI??S CORRUPTION CRACKDOWN FAVORABLY AND BELIEVES THAT IT IS AN EFFECTIVE CAMPAIGN IT??S STRANGE THAT FACTORY BOSSES CAN STILL GET AWAY WITH FLEECING THEIR OWN EMPLOYEES LAND DEVELOPERS CAN STILL CON THEIR CLIENTS AND LOCAL OFFICIALS ARE SOMETIMES STILL SEEN AS VILLAINS. THE PUBLIC ISN??T ENTIRELY BUYING INTO THE XI??S PLAN TO CHANGE OTHER MATTERS OF CONCERN LIKE CLEANING UP CHINA??S AIR AND WATER. BLIPS OF PROTESTS WILL CONTINUE TO APPEAR ACROSS THE COUNTRY BUT THOSE SHOUTS WILL BE MUZZLED QUICKLY. THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY THINKS THE PUBLIC SHOULD BE LIKE DOCILE VICTORIAN CHILDREN??SEEN BUT NOT HEARD. THE PEOPLE HOWEVER HAVE OTHER IDEAS. ,4056.0

LIBERALS SHOULDN??T KID THEMSELVES THAT THE PRESUMPTIVE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE REPUBLICAN FRONTRUNNERS ON THIS SCORE. CONSERVATIVES SHOULD STOP PRETENDING TOO SO THEY CAN GET ON WITH DIGGING INTO AREAS WHERE TRUE POLICY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS MIGHT ACTUALLY MEAN SOMETHING. AND THE REST OF US WHO ARE APPALLED AT THE INCALCULABLE HUMAN COSTS OF A DEMONSTRABLY FAILED BIPARTISAN INTERVENTIONIST FOREIGN POLICY THAT HAS ACCOMPLISHED NEXT TO NOTHING FOR ALL OF THE 21ST CENTURY CAN GET ON WITH FIGURING OUT HOW TO FIGHT BACK AGAINST PERSISTENT WAR HYSTERIA. REGARDLESS OF WHO GETS ELECTED IN NOVEMBER U.S. FOREIGN POLICY WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY NOT CHANGE VERY MUCH FROM A STATUS QUO THAT STOKES GLOBAL INSTABILITY WHILE UNDERWRITING CONSTITUTIONALLY UNSOUND DOMESTIC SURVEILLANCE. IT WILL BE HEAVILY MILITARIZED AND THE PENTAGON WILL GET MORE MONEY THAN IT KNOWS WHAT TO DO WITH. IT??S NOT JUST THAT HILLARY CLINTON GETS ??HIGH-PROFILE FOREIGN POLICY GUIDANCE? FROM THE SAME FIRM THAT ADVISES HAWKISH MARCO RUBIO AND TED CRUZ WHO LAST YEAR SUPPORTED INCREASING THE PENTAGON BUDGET WITHOUT CUTTING OTHER GOVERNMENT OUTLAYS. NOR IS IT THAT AS FIRST LADY CLINTON ??URGED? HER HUSBAND TO BOMB SERBIA IN 1999 AND AS A SENATOR FROM NEW YORK SHE SUPPORTED THE INVASION AND OCCUPATION OF IRAQ WITHOUT RESERVATION AND SAID DURING HER FAILED 2008 PRESIDENTIAL BID ??IF THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO ANY OF YOU IS CHOOSING SOMEONE WHO DID NOT CAST THAT VOTE OR HAS SAID HIS VOTE WAS A MISTAKE THEN THERE ARE OTHERS TO CHOOSE FROM.? AS SECRETARY OF STATE SHE RARELY MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY TO BACK MORE AND BIGGER INTERVENTIONS. ??CLINTON BACKED A BOLD ESCALATION OF THE AFGHANISTAN WAR? WROTE MICHAEL CROWLEY IN TIME IN 2014. ??SHE PRESSED OBAMA TO ARM THE SYRIAN REBELS AND LATER ENDORSED AIR STRIKES AGAINST THE ASSAD REGIME. SHE BACKED INTERVENTION IN LIBYA AND HER STATE DEPARTMENT HELPED ENABLE OBAMA??S EXPANSION OF LETHAL DRONE STRIKES.?ŸIN FACT CLINTON MAY HAVE BEEN THE ADMINISTRATION??S MOST RELIABLE ADVOCATE FOR MILITARY ACTION.? THAT??S EXACTLY THE REASON WHY REPUBLICAN JOHN ??BOMB BOMB BOMB BOMB BOMB IRAN? MCCAIN JOKED TO THE NEW REPUBLIC THAT IT WOULD BE A ??TOUGH CHOICE? FOR HIM IF THE PRESIDENCY CAME DOWN TO CLINTON OR THE LIBERTARIAN-LEANING DOVE RAND PAUL. ??WE CAME WE SAW HE DIED? CLINTON HERSELF JOKED TO CBS NEWS AFTER THE DEATH OF MOAMMAR QADDAFI IN THE WAKE OF BOMBING RUNS JOINED BY THE UNITED STATES. EVEN AFTER LIBYA WAS PLUNGED INTO UTTER CHAOS AND HAS BECOME A ??SAFE HAVEN? FOR ISIS CLINTON STILL CALLS OUR INTERVENTION THERE ??SMART POWER AT ITS BEST.? WHICH RAISES THE QUESTION: WHAT COULD DUMB POWER POSSIBLY LOOK LIKE? AS A CANDIDATE FOR THE 2016 DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION CLINTON HAS SOFTENED HER BELLICOSE RHETORIC EVER SO SLIGHTLY AS SHE TACKS LEFT TO CO-OPT BERNIE SANDERS?? LEFT-LEANING NON-INTERVENTIONIST SUPPORT (THE FORMER ??SENATOR FROM WALL STREET? IS DOING THE SAME ON ECONOMIC ISSUES REPUDIATING TRADE DEALS AND OTHER PRO-MARKET POLICIES SHE LONG SUPPORTED). AS SALON NOTED SHE SUPPORTED THE IRAN DEAL ONLY AFTER IT BECAME CLEAR THAT CONGRESSIONAL CRITICS WOULDN??T BE ABLE TO STOP IT BUT ??SHE TALKED LIKE SOMEBODY READY TO START DROPPING BOMBS.? INDEED SHE REMAINS A HAWK WHO ??GOES BEYOND PRESIDENT OBAMA IN PLANS TO DEFEAT ISIS? AS THE NEW YORK TIMES PUTS IT. ??OUR GOAL IS NOT TO DETER OR CONTAIN ISIS? SHE SAID IN NOVEMBER WHEN CALLING FOR A NO-FLY ZONE IN SYRIA MORE AND BIGGER BOMBING RUNS AND MOST WORRYINGLY OF ALL MORE ??SPECIAL OPERATIONS TROOPS? IN THE MIDDLE EAST TO TRAIN LOCAL FORCES. LIKE MARCO RUBIO WHO ERRONEOUSLY CLAIMS THAT ISLAMIC JIHAD REPRESENTS A ??CIVILIZATIONAL STRUGGLE? AKIN TO THE COLD WAR BATTLE BETWEEN COMMUNISM AND FREE ENTERPRISE CLINTON SAYS THAT THE UNITED STATES ??MUST LEAD THE WORLD TO MEET THIS THREAT.? AMONG OTHER THINGS THAT MEANS LEAVING TROOPS IN AFGHANISTAN AFTER AN ALREADY-DELAYED WITHDRAWAL BECAUSE BEING THE INDISPENSABLE NATION MEANS NEVER HAVING TO SAY YOU??RE SORRY. ??WE HAVE INVESTED A LOT OF BLOOD AND A LOT OF TREASURE IN TRYING TO HELP THAT COUNTRY AND WE CAN??T AFFORD FOR IT TO BECOME AN OUTPOST OF THE TALIBAN AND [ISIS] ONE MORE TIME THREATENING US THREATENING THE LARGER WORLD? CLINTON HAS SAID. PERHAPS THE SECOND 14-YEAR ENGAGEMENT WILL TURN THE TIDE. UNSURPRISINGLY SECRETARY CLINTON ALSO PUSHED FOR KEEPING TROOPS IN IRAQ AS THE ELECTED GOVERNMENT THERE INSISTED WE LEAVE. CLINTON??AND HAWKS IN EITHER PARTY??NEVER ASK WHY A DECADE OR MORE WASN??T ENOUGH TO CREATE ??SECURE STABLE AND SELF-RELIANT? SITUATIONS. AND WHAT SUCH FAILURES SAY ABOUT THE WISDOM OF THE MISSIONS IN THE FIRST PLACE. ULTIMATELY WHAT CLINTON SHARES WITH MOST OF THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES IS A DANGEROUS AND UNTHINKING CONFLATION OF FOREIGN POLICY WITH MILITARY POWER AND ACTION. ??SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE COLD WAR WE BUILT UP A VERY SUBSTANTIAL MILITARY? GORDON ADAMS A PROFESSOR EMERITUS OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICS AT AMERICAN UNIVERSITY AND FORMER BILL CLINTON ADVISER ON SECURITY AND MILITARY BUDGETS TOLD ME RECENTLY IN AN INTERVIEW. ??TO SOME DEGREE EVER SINCE THEN THE INSTINCT IN AMERICAN POLICY HAS BEEN TO SAY THAT THE MOST USEFUL TOOL TO REACH FOR TO DEMONSTRATE AMERICAN LEADERSHIP TO DEMONSTRATE AMERICAN COMMITMENT TO DEMONSTRATE AMERICAN CAPACITY IS OUR MILITARY CAPABILITY.? PART OF THAT WORLDVIEW SIMPLY REFLECTS BUDGETING PRIORITIES. THE PENTAGON SPENDS ABOUT $600 BILLION A YEAR WHILE THE STATE DEPARTMENT??S TOTAL BUDGET OF AROUND $50 BILLION IS LESS THAN WHAT THE PENTAGON SPENDS JUST ON ??OVERSEAS CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS? OR SO-CALLED WAR SPENDING (DESPITE OUR NOT BEING AT WAR). IT??S PARTICULARLY IRONIC THAT A FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE SUCH AS HILLARY CLINTON WOULD BE CAPTIVATED BY SUCH A VIEWPOINT. BUT IT HELPS EXPLAIN WHY DIPLOMACY COMMERCE AND CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS ALWAYS TAKE A BACKSEAT TO SABER-RATTLING AND HUFFING AND PUFFING AMONG PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES INCLUDING THE FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE WHO IS ALWAYS QUICKER TO TALK ABOUT ARMING COUNTRIES THAN EXPANDING TRADE WITH THEM. I DON??T EXPECT CLINTON TO BE CALLED OUT FOR HER HAWKISHNESS BY PARTISAN DEMOCRATS WHO ARE ALREADY TRYING TO SMOOTH HER WAY TO WINNING IN NOVEMBER. AND THE REPUBLICANS ARE CONTENT TO TRY AND GIN UP VOTES BY SPENDING ALL OF THEIR TIME ACCUSING BARACK OBAMA HILLARY CLINTON AND ALL DEMOCRATS AS THE BASTARD OFFSPRING OF GEORGE MCGOVERN AND ACTING AS IF THE PROBLEM WITH 21ST-CENTURY AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY IS THAT WE HAVEN??T INVADED AND OCCUPIED ENOUGH COUNTRIES. IN THE END IT WILL BE UP TO CANDIDATES SUCH AS BERNIE SANDERS AND RAND PAUL TO FORCE THIS CONVERSATION WHEN THEY RETURN TO THE SENATE AND IT WILL BE UP TO LIBERTARIANS AND PROGRESSIVES PUSHING IN FROM THE EDGES TO CALL ATTENTION TO FAILURES THAT EVERYONE SEES BUT FEW IN POWER WILL ACKNOWLEDGE. THAT??S NOT THE WORST OUTCOME IN THE WORLD BUT IT??S SHAME THE TOPIC COULDN??T GET A GOOD HEARING DURING A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION SEASON. ,61683.0

IN A 10-3 RULING ON TUESDAY NEW YORK??S JOINT COMMISSION ON PUBLIC ETHICS VOTED TO EXPAND THE DEFINITION OF LOBBYING TO INCLUDE COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN PUBLIC RELATIONS FIRMS AND JOURNALISTS. IF A COMMUNICATIONS OFFICIAL CONTACTS AN EDITORIAL WRITER IN AN ATTEMPT TO EARN NEWS COVERAGE ON A POLITICAL ISSUE THEY MIGHT HAVE TO DISCLOSE THE COMMUNICATION AS A LOBBYING EFFORT. TRANSPARENCY ADVOCATES SAY THE NEW GUIDELINES WILL KEEP READERS INFORMED IF PUBLICATIONS HAVE UNDERLYING MOTIVES FOR THEIR OPINION PIECES. BUT PR FIRMS AND JOURNALIST ASSOCIATIONS HAVE CONDEMNED THE MOVE AS AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL OVERREACH ONE THAT DISTRACTS FROM REAL ISSUES OF CORRUPTION IN NEW YORK. ??ANY ATTEMPT BY A CONSULTANT TO INDUCE A THIRD-PARTY??WHETHER THE PUBLIC OR THE PRESS??TO DELIVER THE CLIENT??S LOBBYING MESSAGE TO A PUBLIC OFFICIAL WOULD CONSTITUTE LOBBYING UNDER THESE RULES? THE NEW LEGISLATION READS. LISA GRAVES EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR MEDIA AND DEMOCRACY SAYS THESE NEW GUIDELINES ARE NOT RADICALLY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER LOBBYING LAWS. ??I COULD SEE A WAY IN WHICH COMMUNICATION ABOUT A PARTICULAR LEGISLATIVE MEASURE TO AN EDITORIAL BOARD WOULD BE IN THE SAME VEIN AS LOBBYING EVEN THOUGH IT??S NOT TO A PUBLIC OFFICIAL DIRECTLY? GRAVES TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. ??IN THE NONPROFIT WORLD WHEN YOU FILE YOUR DISCLOSURE FORMS TO THE IRS YOU HAVE TO DISCLOSE BOTH YOUR DIRECT LOBBYING AND YOUR GRASSROOTS LOBBYING WHICH INVOLVES URGING PEOPLE TO CONTACT THEIR LAWMAKERS ABOUT A PARTICULAR MATTER.

THEY??RE TASKED WITH CLEANING UP THE LEGISLATURE. THEY??RE TASKED WITH MAKING GOOD GOVERNMENT HAPPEN IN ALBANY. THEY??RE NOT TASKED WITH MONITORING WHO TALKS TO THE PRESS.? REA SAID RAMPANT CORRUPTION IN THE STATE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE ALBANY??S PRIORITY. AFTER ALL NEW YORK RECENTLY SAW ASSEMBLY SPEAKER SHELDON SILVER AND SENATE MAJORITY LEADER DEAN SKELOS CONVICTED OF CORRUPTION CHARGES. SHE??S NOT ALONE IN QUESTIONING THE STATE??S LOGIC. PUBLIC RELATIONS FIRM THE NOVEMBER TEAM SENT ALBANY LEADERS A LIST OF 48 QUESTIONS ON THE NEW MEASURES INCLUDING ??DO YOU THINK THAT STRAIGHT NEWS STORIES ARE IMPREGNABLE TO INFLUENCE BUT NOT EDITORIALS?? OR ??IF A NEWS RELEASE IS SENT TO A COLUMNIST DOES THAT RELEASE HAVE TO BE REPORTED?? AND ??HOW MANY FIRST AMENDMENT EXPERTS WERE CONSULTED?? THE NOVEMBER TEAM HAS ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WILL ??REFUSE TO COMPLY? WITH THE NEW GUIDELINES CRAIN??S REPORTS. LAWMAKERS DISMISSED FEARS OF FIRST AMENDMENT VIOLATIONS AS BEING OVERBLOWN CITING ??SOME VERY DRAMATIC READINGS FROM CERTAIN MEDIA OUTLETS? POLITICO NEW YORK REPORTS.

LEVINSON WAS KIDNAPPED WHILE WORKING IN IRAN IN 2007 AND AFTER APPEARING THREE YEARS LATER IN A VIDEO AND THEN A SERIES PHOTOS MADE BY HIS CAPTORS HE HASN??T BEEN HEARD FROM SINCE. UNUSUALLY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION MADE NO PUBLIC STATEMENTS LAST WEEK CALLING ON IRAN ALSO TO FREE LEVINSON AND THERE??S AT LEAST ONE REASON FOR THAT: SENIOR OFFICIALS IN THE U.S. INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY AND THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVE THAT IRAN DOESN??T ACTUALLY KNOW WHERE LEVINSON IS CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICIALS WITH KNOWLEDGE OF HIS CASE TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. ??I THINK IT??S NEARLY CERTAIN THAT THEY DON??T KNOW WHERE HE IS? ONE FORMER OFFICIAL SAID SPEAKING ON CONDITION OF ANONYMITY BECAUSE THE U.S. IS STILL WORKING WITH IRAN TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO LEVINSON. THEY AREN??T RELYING MERELY ON THE WORDS OF IRANIAN OFFICIALS WHO??VE SAID FOR YEARS THEY DON??T HAVE INFORMATION ON LEVINSON??S WHEREABOUTS OR WHO TOOK HIM. INTELLIGENCE THAT THE U.S. HAS COLLECTED ON IRAN AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAS HELPED TO PERSUADE SOME WHO??VE BEEN WORKING TO FIND LEVINSON THAT TEHRAN HAS LOST HIS TRAIL??IF THEY EVER HAD IT. THE CONCLUSION AMONG SENIOR OFFICIALS THAT IRAN DOESN??T KNOW HOW TO FIND LEVINSON HELPS TO EXPLAIN WHY HE WASN??T PART OF THE RECENT SWAP THAT ENDED WITH FOUR AMERICANS INCLUDING WASHINGTON POST JOURNALIST JASON REZAIAN BEING FREED. FOR YEARS COMPETING THEORIES ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO LEVINSON HAVE ONLY DEEPENED THE MYSTERY SURROUNDING HIS CASE. SOME HAVE SPECULATED HE WAS KIDNAPPED BY ORGANIZED CRIMINALS WHILE WORKING ON A PRIVATE INVESTIGATION ON IRAN??S KISH ISLAND OR THAT HE WAS TAKEN BY A ROGUE FACTION IN THE IRANIAN SECURITY SERVICES OR IN THE COUNTRY??S REVOLUTIONARY GUARD CORPS WHICH OPERATES WITH CONSIDERABLE AUTONOMY. THE FACT THAT SOME U.S. OFFICIALS NOW BELIEVE THAT THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT DOESN??T KNOW WHERE LEVINSON IS MAY BOLSTER THOSE THEORIES. BRETT MCGURK A TOP U.S. DIPLOMAT WHO WORKED ON THE PRISONER??S?? RELEASE TOLD CNN THAT IF THE U.S. ??KNEW BOB LEVINSON WAS IN A PRISON CELL IN IRAN I THINK YOU KNOW WE??D HAVE A DIFFERENT OUTCOME HERE.? ??IN FACT IT APPEARS THAT HE??S NOT BEING HELD IN IRAN? MCGURK ADDED ECHOING STATEMENTS FROM TOP ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS OVER THE YEARS INCLUDING FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY CLINTON THAT LEVINSON WAS MOVED OUT OF THE COUNTRY YEARS AGO. IN 2011 CLINTON SAID PUBLICLY THAT RECENT INFORMATION INDICATED LEVINSON WAS BEING HELD ??SOMEWHERE IN SOUTHWEST ASIA.? IN AN INTERVIEW LAST SUNDAY WITH CBS?? FACE THE NATION? CLINTON SEEMED TO PUT HERSELF IN THE CAMP WITH THOSE WHO THINK LEVINSON IS EITHER DEAD OR BEYOND TEHRAN??S REACH. ??I REGRET DEEPLY THAT ROBERT LEVINSON WAS NOT ON HIS WAY HOME EITHER? CLINTON TOLD HOST JOHN DICKERSON WHO ASKED IF SHE THOUGHT ??THE IRANIANS KNOW WHERE HE IS.? ??AND I HOPE AND EXPECT THAT THE IRANIANS WILL CONTINUE TO BE PRESSED VERY VERY HARD TO GIVE UP ANY INFORMATION THEY HAVE AND IF POSSIBLE TO RETURN BOB LEVINSON TO HIS HOME AND FAMILY.? THE PHRASE ??IF POSSIBLE? WAS TELLING ON A FEW LEVELS. FIRST IT IMPLIED THAT THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO SAY WHERE LEVINSON IS. IT ALSO SUGGESTED THAT HE MAY NO LONGER BE ALIVE. U.S. OFFICIALS HAVE SAID THEY NEVER STOPPED TRYING TO FIND LEVINSON. MORE THAN A YEAR AGO THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION OPENED A SEPARATE CHANNEL OF DISCUSSION WITH IRAN DEVOTED EXCLUSIVELY TO REPATRIATING AMERICANS WHICH ENDED IN THE PRISONER SWAP. LEVINSON??S STATUS ??WAS ALSO CENTRAL TO THESE DISCUSSIONS? A SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL TOLD REPORTERS ON SUNDAY. ??WE??VE ALSO AGREED TO CONTINUE A DIALOGUE WITH IRAN THROUGH MULTIPLE CHANNELS FOR MISSING PERSONS IN PARTICULAR FOR BOB LEVINSON? THE OFFICIAL ADDED. ??AND WE MADE SOME PROGRESS IN THAT CASE BUT THAT??S A CASE THAT WE ARE NEVER GOING TO QUIT AND NEVER GOING TO GIVE UP ON AND HE??S CENTRAL TO OUR MINDS EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND WE??RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO EVERYTHING WE POSSIBLY CAN TO FIND BOB AND BRING HIM HOME.? BUT LEVINSON??S SON SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE MISSING AMERICAN??S FAMILY REJECTED THE NOTION THAT IRANIAN OFFICIALS COULDN??T LOCATE HIS FATHER AND SAID HE FEARED THE CAPTIVE WAS ALREADY BEING FORGOTTEN. ??I THINK IT??S ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS TO THINK THAT THE IRANIANS DON??T KNOW? DAN LEVINSON TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. ??HE WAS PICKED UP BY THE IRANIAN SECURITY FORCES AND THE IRANIAN STATE MEDIA REPORTED THAT. ?? THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT WHO KNOW EXACTLY WHERE MY DAD IS.? AND THERE ARE PEOPLE WITHIN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WHO BELIEVE THAT TOO. THEY TEND TO WORK IN THE FBI WHERE LEVINSON WAS ONCE AN AGENT THE CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICIALS SAID. CNN REPORTED ON WEDNESDAY THAT FBI INVESTIGATORS BELIEVE LEVINSON IF HE IS ALIVE IS STILL BEING HELD IN IRAN. LEVINSON??S SON SAID HE THOUGHT IT WAS PLAUSIBLE THAT TOP LEADERS IN THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT INCLUDING FOREIGN MINISTER JAVAD ZARIF AND PRESIDENT HASSAN ROUHANI DON??T KNOW HOW TO FIND LEVINSON. ??IT MIGHT BE OTHER PEOPLE IN ROGUE FACTIONS OF THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT THAT ACTUALLY HAVE HIM? THE YOUNGER LEVINSON SAID. BUT HE INSISTED THAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ??NEEDS TO PRESS HARDER TO SPEAK TO THOSE PEOPLE? AND TO ANYONE ELSE WHO MIGHT HAVE INFORMATION ON HIS FATHER. LEVINSON SAID HE WORRIED THAT IF MANY OFFICIALS CONCLUDE THERE??S NO REAL HOPE OF FINDING HIS DAD THE MOMENTUM TO FINALLY BRING HIM HOME WILL STALL AND HE??LL BE FORGOTTEN. LEVINSON SAID HIS FAMILY ALREADY FELT NEGLECTED. THEY ONLY FOUND OUT THAT U.S. HOSTAGES HAD BEEN FREED FROM WATCHING NEWS REPORTS. LEVINSON SAID THAT SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY HAD SPOKEN TO HIS MOTHER LAST TUESDAY JUST A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE SWAP BUT HE GAVE NO HINT OF ANY IMMINENT RELEASE. WHEN THE FAMILY HEARD THE NEWS THEY IMMEDIATELY BEGAN CALLING THEIR CONTACTS IN THE ADMINISTRATION DEMANDING TO KNOW WHY LEVINSON WASN??T AMONG THOSE RETURNING TO THE U.S. ??YOU LEFT HIM BEHIND AGAIN!! MY FAMILY IS IN TEARS? LEVINSON??S MOTHER WROTE TO ONE ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL IN AN EMAIL THAT HER SON READ TO THE DAILY BEAST.

NOW THE AGENCY IS FINALLY TAKING DIRECT ACTION TO LIMIT THE USE OF THIS POPULAR BUT POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS PRODUCT. IN A PRESS RELEASE ON MONDAY THE FDA ANNOUNCED THAT THE SURGICAL MESH USED TO TREAT PELVIC ORGAN PROLAPSE (POP) WILL BE RECLASSIFIED AS A CLASS III OR HIGH-RISK MEDICAL DEVICE. IN ADDITION MANUFACTURERS WILL HAVE TO RECEIVE PREMARKET APPROVAL (PMA) FOR SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS TO KEEP SELLING THE PRODUCT. ??THESE STRONGER CLINICAL REQUIREMENTS WILL HELP TO ADDRESS THE SIGNIFICANT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SURGICAL MESH FOR REPAIR OF PELVIC ORGAN PROLAPSE? SAID DR. WILLIAM MAISEL DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF SCIENCE AND CHIEF SCIENTIST FOR THE FDA??S CENTER FOR DEVICES AND RADIOLOGICAL HEALTH. ??WE INTEND TO CONTINUE MONITORING HOW WOMEN WITH THIS DEVICE ARE FARING MONTHS AND YEARS AFTER SURGERY THROUGH CONTINUED POSTMARKET SURVEILLANCE MEASURES.? POP IS A COMMON CONDITION IN WHICH WEAKENED PELVIC FLOOR MUSCLES??WHETHER CAUSED BY AGING CHILDBIRTH A HYSTERECTOMY OR ANOTHER RISK FACTOR??ALLOW PELVIC ORGANS LIKE THE BLADDER BOWELS OR UTERUS TO DESCEND INTO THE VAGINA CAUSING PELVIC PAIN PROBLEMS WITH INTERCOURSE AND URINARY ISSUES. ESTIMATES OF ITS PREVALENCE VARY BUT A 2002 STUDY IN THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY FOUND POP IN OVER 40 PERCENT OF WOMEN OVER 60 WHO HAD NOT HAD A HYSTERECTOMY. IN 2002 SURGICAL MESH WAS CLEARED BY THE FDA AS A CLASS II OR MODERATE-RISK TREATMENT FOR REINFORCING THE PELVIC FLOOR MUSCLES AND PERMANENTLY REPAIRING POP. THAT WAS BEFORE THE AGENCY RECEIVED ??THOUSANDS OF REPORTS? ABOUT ADVERSE EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRODUCT. THOSE RISKS WHICH THE AGENCY FIRST CAUTIONED PATIENTS ABOUT IN 2008 INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO SEVERE PELVIC PAIN INFECTION BLEEDING ORGAN PERFORATION URINARY PROBLEMS AND VAGINAL SCARRING. THAT YEAR THE FDA REPORTED THAT THEY HAD RECEIVED ??OVER 1000? REPORTS OF THESE ADVERSE EVENTS. BY 2011 WHEN THE FDA ISSUED A SECOND WARNING THEY HAD RECEIVED NEARLY 2000 MORE REPORTS. IN BOLD PRINT IN THAT YEAR??S SAFETY COMMUNICATION THE AGENCY NOTED THAT THESE SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS ARE ??NOT RARE???A CHANGE FROM THEIR 2008 REPORTING. THE MOST COMMON COMPLICATION THEY NOTED WAS THE EROSION OF MESH THROUGH THE VAGINA WHICH CAN REQUIRE MULTIPLE SURGERIES TO RESOLVE IF IT CAN BE RESOLVED AT ALL. PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS ALIKE WERE WARNED TO ??BE AWARE OF THE RISKS? BEFORE PURSUING MESH-BASED TREATMENTS. ??RECOGNIZE THAT IN MOST CASES POP CAN BE TREATED SUCCESSFULLY WITHOUT MESH THUS AVOIDING THE RISK OF MESH-RELATED COMPLICATIONS? THE FDA TOLD HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. AS TRANSVAGINAL MESH MANUFACTURERS WERE HIT WITH THOUSANDS OF LAWSUITS THE FDA PLACED THEM UNDER FURTHER SCRUTINY AS WELL INITIATING THE POSTMARKET SURVEILLANCE THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY LEAD TO THE AGENCY??S MOST RECENT ORDERS. BY MID-2014 THERE WERE NEARLY 60000 PENDING TRANSVAGINAL MESH LAWSUITS. NOW IF MANUFACTURERS WANT TO KEEP MAKING THIS MESH THEY HAVE A 30-MONTH DEADLINE TO SUBMIT THEIR PMA. IT IS AT LAST A BOLD MOVE TO LIMIT A TREATMENT THAT WAS BECOMING INCREASINGLY POPULAR EVEN AS THE FDA WARNED OF THE SERIOUS RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH IT. A JUNE 2015 STUDY PUBLISHED IN THE BMJ EXAMINING POP-RELATED SURGERIES IN NEW YORK FOUND THAT MESH USE ACTUALLY INCREASED BY 44.7 PERCENT FROM 2008 TO 2011. ??DESPITE MULTIPLE WARNINGS RELEASED BY THE FDA SINCE 2008 USE OF MESH IN PELVIC ORGAN PROLAPSE SURGERY CONTINUES TO GROW? THE AUTHORS CONCLUDED ADDING THAT THIS INCREASE WAS TAKING PLACE ??EVEN THREE TO FOUR YEARS AFTER REGULATORY ALERTS.? POP-RELATED SURGERIES ARE BIG BUSINESS. IN THE UNITED STATES THERE ARE OVER 300000 SUCH SURGERIES ANNUALLY COSTING OVER $1 BILLION. BUT ALTHOUGH MESH BECAME WIDELY PERCEIVED AS A ??QUICK FIX? TREATMENT OPTION FOR POP AFTER ITS INTRODUCTION IN THE 1990S IT IS FAR FROM THE ONLY WAY TO MANAGE THIS COMMON CONDITION EVEN IN THE OPERATING ROOM. AS THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS (AAFP) NOTES SOME OF THE SYMPTOMS OF POP SUCH AS URINARY PROBLEMS CAN BE COUNTERACTED WITH KEGEL EXERCISES. EVEN SEVERE INSTANCES OF POP CAN BE TREATED WITH A PESSARY A REMOVABLE AND WASHABLE RUBBER DEVICE INSERTED INTO THE VAGINA THAT KEEPS PELVIC ORGANS IN PLACE. A PESSARY AS A 2010 STUDY IN THE AAFP??S JOURNAL NOTED ??CAN BE USED IN ALMOST ALL CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN A NONSURGICAL OPTION IS DESIRED? EVEN THOUGH IT HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN SEEN AS A SHORT-TERM SOLUTION. PESSARIES ASIDE THERE ARE NON-MESH SURGICAL OPTIONS THAT MAY CARRY LESS RISK WHILE BEING JUST AS EFFECTIVE. THE 2015 BMJ STUDY FOUND THAT NON-MESH SURGERIES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH LESS RISK OF REINTERVENTION WITHIN A YEAR IN PATIENTS UNDER 65. AND IN 2012 DR. DIANE MITCHELL ASSISTANT DIRECTOR FOR SCIENCE AT THE FDA??S CENTER FOR DEVICES AND RADIOLOGICAL HEALTH SAID IN A MEDSCAPE BROADCAST ??POSTMARKETING DATA INDICATE THAT REPAIR OF POP WITH SURGICAL MESH IS NO MORE EFFECTIVE THAN POP REPAIR WITH SUTURES ALONE PARTICULARLY FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF PROLAPSE.? ??PATIENTS WHO UNDERGO POP REPAIR WITH MESH ARE OFTEN SUBJECT TO COMPLICATIONS NOT EXPERIENCED BY PATIENTS WHO UNDERGO SURGERY WITHOUT MESH? SHE EMPHASIZED NOTING THAT THESE COMPLICATIONS CAN BE ??PERMANENT AND LIFE-ALTERING.? UNLESS THE FIVE MANUFACTURERS CURRENTLY MAKING TRANSVAGINAL MESH CAN DOCUMENT ITS SAFETY THE PRODUCT WILL BE GONE IN 2019 AND LISTED AS HIGH RISK BY THE FDA UNTIL THEN. THIS COULD BE THE DEATH KNELL FOR ONE OF THE MOST LITIGATED MEDICAL PRODUCTS STILL IN USE TODAY. ,13643.0

FOX NEWS MODERATOR MEGYN KELLY CHALLENGED RUBIO FOR OPPOSING CITIZENSHIP FOR UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS DURING HIS 2010 SENATE CAMPAIGN BEFORE EVENTUALLY SPONSORING THE 'GANG OF EIGHT' IMMIGRATION BILL AFTER HE JOINED THE SENATE. THE GANG OF EIGHT IMMIGRATION REFORM PACKAGE INCLUDED A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP. RUBIO STUMBLED AT HER QUESTION SAYING THAT HE ONLY OPPOSED \BLANKET AMNESTY.\"" BUSH WHO SUPPORTS A LEGAL STATUS FOR UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS SAID RUBIO ABANDONED THE PACKAGE AS SOON AS HE FELT IT WAS BECOMING UNPOPULAR. IT WAS AN ODD EXCHANGE BETWEEN TWO REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES WHO BOTH AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER SUPPORTED A LEGAL STATUS FOR IMMIGRANTS WHO ENTERED THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY. \""YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE CUT AND RUN\"" BUSH TOLD RUBIO THOUGH THE TWO HAVE HAD SIMILAR POSITIONS ON IMMIGRATION OVER THE YEARS. \""NOW IT'S HARDER AND HARDER TO ACTUALLY SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.\"" \""YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO RAM DOWN THE THROAT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE YOUR APPROACH\"" RUBIO RESPONDED.

THEY ARE FLEEING THE WAR THAT??S RAGING IN THEIR COUNTRY AND HAVE SCRATCHED TOGETHER THEIR LAST MONEY TO PAY FOR A PLACE ON A FLIMSY BOAT THAT IS SUPPOSED TO TAKE THEM FROM TURKEY TO GREECE AND TO A BETTER SAFER LIFE IN EUROPE. BUT WHEN THEIR DINGHY CAPSIZES IN THE ICY WATERS OF THE WINTRY AEGEAN SEA AS MANY DO SOME SYRIAN REFUGEES FIND THAT THE LIFE VESTS THEY BOUGHT ON SHORE DRAG THEM DOWN BECAUSE THEY ARE STUFFED WITH FOAM CLOTH OR PAPER PACKAGING INSTEAD OF FLOTATION MATERIALS. AS TURKEY IS TRYING TO REDUCE THE NUMBERS OF SYRIANS CROSSING INTO THE EUROPEAN UNION IN LINE WITH A DEAL IT STRUCK WITH EUROPEAN LEADERS IN NOVEMBER AUTHORITIES ALSO ARE STRUGGLING TO FIGHT AN ILLICIT ECONOMY THAT HAS SPRUNG UP AROUND THE MASS EXODUS AND THAT INCLUDES MORE THAN JUST GANGS OF PEOPLE SMUGGLERS. GREECE RECEIVED AROUND 850000 REFUGEES LAST YEAR MOST OF WHOM CAME TO THE COUNTRY VIA TURKEY. THAT??S A LOT OF PEOPLE IN NEED OF LIFE VESTS AND OTHER ITEMS. THIS WEEK POLICE IN IZMIR THE BIGGEST CITY ON THE TURKISH AEGEAN COAST AND A CENTER OF THE EXODUS TOWARDS GREECE RAIDED AN ILLEGAL WORKPLACE PRODUCING LIFE VESTS FOR REFUGEES. OFFICERS FOUND TWO UNDERAGE SYRIAN GIRLS AND TWO OTHER PEOPLE WORKING ON VESTS THAT WERE FILLED WITH PACKAGING. THE OWNER OF THE PLACE WAS ARRESTED. CASH-STRAPPED REFUGEES PIN THEIR HOPE OF SURVIVAL ON THESE LIFE JACKETS THAT COST AS LITTLE AS 20 TURKISH LIRA ($7) ACCORDING TO TURKISH NEWS REPORTS. SOME ARE FILLED WITH SPONGES THAT SOAK UP WATER AND CAUSE DEATHS RATHER THAN SAVE LIVES. EARLIER THIS WEEK THE BODIES OF 34 PEOPLE WHO HAD DROWNED TRYING TO REACH THE NEARBY GREEK ISLAND OF LESBOS WERE WASHED ONTO BEACHES IN NORTHWESTERN TURKEY. MANY OF THE BODIES WERE STILL WEARING THEIR BOGUS LIFE VESTS. THE POLICE RAID IN IZMIR WAS NOT THE FIRST SIGN THAT SOME IN TURKEY ARE TRYING TO CASH IN ON THE WAVE OF REFUGEES EVEN IF IT MEANS PUTTING PEOPLES?? LIVES AT RISK. LAST SUMMER TURKISH NEWSPAPERS REPORTED THAT REFUGEES IN THE IZMIR AREA HAD TURNED TO CHEAP UNDER-THE-COUNTER LIFE VESTS THAT WERE BLACK INSTEAD OF ORANGE IN ORDER TO EVADE TURKISH COAST GUARD BOATS DURING THE CROSSING TO GREECE. THE VESTS ALSO MADE THEM LESS VISIBLE IN THE WATER AND LESS LIKELY TO BE RESCUED IF THEIR BOATS CAPSIZED. THE QUICK-BUCK CORRUPTION APPEARS TO BE PERVASIVE. LAST SEPTEMBER FRANCE SUSPENDED ITS HONORARY CONSUL IN THE RESORT OF BODRUM AFTER TELEVISION FOOTAGE SHOWED HER SELLING BOATS AND LIFE VESTS TO REFUGEES. THE SACKED OFFICIAL FRAN??OISE OLCAY SAID AT THE TIME THAT IF SHE DID NOT SELL THE ITEMS TO THE REFUGEES SOMEONE ELSE WOULD. SHE WAS RIGHT IN THE SENSE THAT THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF CYNICS EXPLOITING THE SYRIAN EXODUS. WELL-ORGANIZED GANGS OF PEOPLE SMUGGLERS RELY ON NETWORKS THAT INCLUDE CHEAP HOTELS IN COASTAL TOWNS BUS AND TAXI DRIVERS FERRYING REFUGEES TO THE BEACHES SOMETIMES FROM AS FAR AS ISTANBUL AND SUPPLIERS OF BOATS. IN OCTOBER POLICE IN IZMIR DISCOVERED A WORKPLACE PRODUCING RUBBER BOATS TO BE SOLD TO REFUGEES. AUTHORITIES SAID THE BOATS WERE NOT SEAWORTHY. WELL-HEELED SYRIANS DON??T HAVE SUCH WORRIES. THEY CAN BOOK A CROSSING ON A LUXURIOUS SPEEDBOAT. POLICE IN THE SOUTHERN RESORT OF MARMARIS BROKE UP A PEOPLE SMUGGLING GANG TWO MONTHS AGO THAT SPECIALIZED IN FERRYING WEALTHY MIGRANTS TO A NEARBY GREEK ISLAND IN SMALL GROUPS TO AVOID ATTENTION. DUBBED A ??VIP SERVICE FOR REFUGEES? BY TURKISH MEDIA THE GANG OFFERED A SAFE TEN-MINUTE CROSSING AT THE PRICE OF $3300 PER HEAD ABOUT THREE TIMES THE GOING RATE OF A PLACE IN A RUBBER DINGHY TO SYRIANS WHO WERE POSING AS TOURISTS. THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT SAYS IT IS DOING ALL IT CAN DO BRING REFUGEES NUMBERS DOWN AND TO BATTLE PEOPLE SMUGGLERS. ??MORE THAN 200 IRREGULAR MIGRATION ORGANIZERS HAVE BEEN APPREHENDED AND NUMEROUS RINGS HAVE BEEN DISMANTLED SO FAR SINCE 2014? A GOVERNMENT FACTSHEET SAID LAST NOVEMBER. BUT ANKARA SAYS IT IS NOT ONLY UP AGAINST THE SMUGGLERS BUT ALSO AGAINST THE REFUGEES?? DETERMINATION. ??BEHAVIORAL PROFILES CLEARLY SHOW THAT IRREGULAR MIGRANTS TAKE ALL CURRENT RISKS IN CASES OF MIGRATION BY SEA AND THEY DO NOT HESITATE TO TRY?ŸSUCH PERILOUS JOURNEYS REPEATEDLY UNTIL THEY SUCCEED? THE FACTSHEET SAID. THAT FACT SHOWS NO SIGN OF CHANGING. IN AKSARAY A NEIGHBORHOOD ON THE EUROPEAN SIDE OF ISTANBUL THAT HAS BECOME A CENTRAL MEETING POINT FOR REFUGEES PASSPORT FORGERS AND PEOPLE SMUGGLERS SYRIANS SAID THAT THEY WERE AWARE OF STRICTER CHECKS BY TURKISH POLICE ALONG THE COAST AND OF PROMISES OF A BETTER LIFE IN TURKEY WITH THE HELP OF $3.3 BILLION IN EU AID MONEY THAT IS PART OF THE DEAL HAMMERED OUT BY EUROPEAN AND TURKISH LEADERS. BUT THAT DOESN??T MEAN THEY HAVE GIVEN UP ON THEIR DREAM OF GOING TO EUROPE. MEHMET A 51-YEAR-OLD FATHER OF FOUR WHO WAS SELLING INSTANT COFFEE TO PASSERS-BY IN AKSARAY ONE COLD MORNING RECENTLY SAID HE WAS STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY THE MONTHLY RENT OF $220 FOR THE APARTMENT WHERE HE LIVES WITH HIS FAMILY. ??IF I HAD THE MONEY I WOULD GO TO GERMANY TOMORROW? HE SAID. FOR THE MOMENT HOWEVER MEHMET CAN??T SEE HOW HE CAN COME UP WITH THE $1000 PER HEAD THAT THE SMUGGLERS CHARGE FOR THE BOAT TRIP TO A GREEK ISLAND. ONE OF MEHMET??S FRIENDS POINTED TO A FOUR-LANE ROAD NEARBY THAT PASSES ISTANBUL??S POLICE HEADQUARTERS AND LEADS OUT OF THE CITY TO THE HIGHWAY. ??TONIGHT BUSSES WILL BE LEAVING FOR IZMIR AGAIN? HE SAID. ??AND FROM IZMIR IT??S JUST A HOP AND A JUMP TO GREECE.? FOR THOSE SCRAPING TOGETHER EVERY CENT TO TRY TO MAKE IT THE TEMPTATION TO SAVE MONEY ON A BARGAIN BOAT OR BARGAIN LIFE VESTS IS GREAT EVEN IF THE FRAUD BEHIND THEM PROVES FATAL. ,12502.0

RYAN SEACREST WAS TANNER THAN AN OOMPA LOOMPA HAD FROSTED TIPS AND HAD NOT YET WORKED SO MANY HOURS ON SO MANY JOBS THAT HONESTLY RYAN WE??RE CONCERNED FOR YOUR HEALTH. THERE WAS A HUMAN NAMED BRIAN DUNKLEMAN. HE WAS AT ONE TIME AS FAMOUS AS RYAN SEACREST! POOR BRIAN DUNKLEMAN. IT WAS JUNE 11 2002 AND A TELEVISION SHOW CALLED AMERICAN IDOL WAS ABOUT TO PREMIERE. THE SERIES WOULD CHANGE THE FACE OF MUSIC DEMOCRATIZING THE PROCESS OF MINTING NEW MUSIC SUPERSTARS AND INTRODUCING THE WORLD TO INDUSTRY JUGGERNAUTS LIKE KELLY CLARKSON CARRIE UNDERWOOD AND JENNIFER HUDSON. IT ALTERED THE FACE OF TELEVISION AS WELL. IN TANDEM WITH SURVIVOR THE MAMMOTH SUCCESS OF THE SHOW BIRTHED A REALITY TV BOOM THAT AT ONE POINT THREATENED TO SUFFOCATE SCRIPTED PROGRAMMING ENTIRELY. EVERYDAY PEOPLE WERE MADE VERY FAMOUS. THE SADDER THE SOB STORY THE MORE OBNOXIOUS THE JACKASS THE MORE APPALLING THE ACTING OUT THE LONGER WE EXTENDED THEIR 15 MINUTES. WHAT BEGAN SO WHOLESOMELY WITH KELLY CLARKSON ADORABLY SAYING ??COOL BEANS? IN HER OUTFIT SEWED OUT OF OLD JEANS EVENTUALLY DARE I SAY IT LED TO DONALD TRUMP RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. (THE APPRENTICE WOULD NOT EXIST WERE IT NOT FOR THE SUCCESS OF AMERICAN IDOL. DONALD TRUMP??S PUBLIC PROFILE WOULDN??T HAVE RESURRECTED WITHOUT THE SUCCESS OF THE APPRENTICE. AND HERE WE ARE. LOOK WHAT YOU DID PAULA ABDUL!) IT??S BEEN 13 YEARS AND A WHOPPING 14 AMERICAN IDOLS CROWNED SINCE THE DAYS OF DUNKLEMAN AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT THE REALITY TV STALWART DEBUTED WHAT WILL BE ITS FAREWELL SEASON. IT SPEAKS VOLUMES ABOUT WHAT REALITY TV AND SPECIFICALLY IDOL HAS BECOME THAT THE MOST TALKED ABOUT MOMENT IS NOT AN AUDITION BY ONE OF THE HOPEFUL SUPERSTARS BUT AN EXERCISE IN EGO MASTURBATION AND HEADLINE BAITING BY KANYE WEST AND THE IDOL PRODUCERS WHO OK??D?ŸHIS FAKE AUDITION. BUT THE REST OF THE TWO HOURS MADE A CASE FOR WHY AMERICAN IDOL AS A FORM OF ENTERTAINMENT IS AS STRONG AS EVER. ?Ÿ CRITICS OF THE AGING SHOW HAVE?ŸARGUED ITS IRRELEVANCE. THOUGH IDOL ALUMS CONTINUE TO POP UP IN THE WORLD OF ENTERTAINMENT??BEST NEW ARTIST GRAMMY NOMINEE?ŸTORI KELLY ONCE COMPETED ON THE SHOW??IT??S HARD TO ARGUE THAT IN RECENT YEARS IT IS FAILED IN ITS FOUNDING MISSION: TO FIND THE NEXT MUSIC SUPERSTAR. QUICK! TELL ME THE NAMES OF THE LAST TWO WINNERS. (UPDATE: I HAVE GOOGLED AND CAN??T SAY THAT I??VE EVER HEARD THE NAMES CALEB JOHNSON AND NICK FRADIANI IN MY LIFE.) BUT YOU??D ALSO BE IN THE SAME BOAT IF YOU WERE ASKED ABOUT ANYONE WHO HAS EVER WON THE VOICE A RATINGS BLOCKBUSTER FOR NBC BUT WHICH ALSO HAS?ŸNOT MADE GOOD ON ITS PROMISE TO DELIVER TO US THE NEXT GREAT MUSIC SUPERSTAR. DITTO TO THE?ŸNOW DEFUNCT THE X FACTOR COWELL??S OVERWROUGHT IDOL CLONE. WHAT THE VOICE OFFERS IS WHAT THROUGH ITS 15-SEASON EVOLUTION AMERICAN IDOL HAS TRANSFORMED TO OFFER: LESS A TALENT COMPETITION THAN TALENT TELEVISION. AMUSING SIMON-PAULA ANTICS LED TO CELEBRITY JUDGES THAT STEAL FOCUS FROM THE CONTESTANTS. COMMODITIZING THE LAUGHING STOCK OF?ŸWILLIAM HUNG GAVE WAY TO AN EXPLOITATIVE OVEREMPHASIS ON THE FREAK SHOW PARADE OF BAD AUDITIONS. THE BACKLASH TO THAT PAVED THE WAY FOR THE BOMBASTIC OVER-THE-TOP PRODUCTION VALUE OF THE CONTESTANTS?? PERFORMANCES. SO IN ITS FINAL DAYS AMERICAN IDOL IS LYING IN A BED OF ITS OWN MAKING. AS WE TOSS AND TURN IN IT WE JUDGE THE FAREWELL SEASON OF THE SHOW ON WHAT IT IS NOW MORE THAN EVER: SHEER ENTERTAINMENT. FORGET THE TALENT SEARCH. BY THAT REGARD CONSIDER WEDNESDAY NIGHT??S SEASON 15 START A ROUSING SUCCESS. IT??S TELLING THAT THE FIRST FIVE??MAYBE EVEN 10??MINUTES PASSED BEFORE A SINGLE FULL AUDITION WAS SHOWN. THERE WAS FOOTAGE OF THE SHOW??S GREATEST MOMENTS AND WINNERS (TAYLOR HICKS SIGHTING!) WITH THE CURRENT JUDGES EXPLAINING HOW THE SHOW HAS CHANGED TELEVISION AND IN THE GRAND TRADITION OF AMERICAN IDOL??S GLEEFUL EMBRACE OF HYPERBOLE EVEN THE WORLD. THERE WERE LOTS OF CLIP PACKAGES AND INSPIRATIONAL MUSIC. OCCASIONALLY THERE WAS A SECOND OR TWO OF A PERSON ACTUALLY SINGING. THROUGH IT ALL JENNIFER LOPEZ??S SKIN GLOWED WITH THE KISSES OF A THOUSAND ANGELS. NOSTALGIA??S IN THESE DAYS SO THE WALK DOWN MEMORY LANE WAS QUITE DELIGHTFUL IF A BIT INTERMINABLE. AT THE END OF THE ROSE-COLORED ROAD WAS A REMINDER OF WHY WERE ALL OSTENSIBLY TUNING-IN IN THE FIRST PLACE: TO FIND A BOOKEND TO KELLY CLARKSON. THE LAST AMERICAN IDOL. FIRST UP WAS 15-YEAR-OLD MICHELLE A LITTLE GIRL WHO HAS BEEN ALIVE FOR BARELY LONGER THAN THIS SHOW HAS EXISTED AND IS NOW OLD ENOUGH TO AUDITION. SHE SINGS LEANN RIMES??S ??BLUE? THROUGH HER BRACES. SHE GETS A GOLDEN TICKET TO HOLLYWOOD AND HER WHOLE FAMILY RUSHES IN SCREAMING AND YELPING AND GIVING HER HUGS. KELLY CLARKSON??S ??HEARTBEAT SONG? PLAYS TRIUMPHANTLY OVER B-ROLL OF RAMPANT ENTHUSIASM. I CRIED. THIS IS WHY I WATCH AMERICAN IDOL OR ANY REALITY TV COMPETITION SERIES REALLY. IT??S FOR YOU OR IT ISN??T. GIVE ME EMOTIONALLY MANIPULATIVE MUSIC BOOMING OVER DREAMS COMING TRUE AND I AM THERE. THERE WERE 15 INSTANCES OF WEEPING IN THE FIRST 12 MINUTES OF THE BIGGEST LOSER PREMIERE MONDAY NIGHT AND I??M WONDERING WHERE THAT SHOW??S PEABODY IS. FOLLOWING LITTLE MICHELLE IS A 17-YEAR-OLD NAMED JOSIAH SISKA DRIVING HOME THE POINT THAT VIEWING THIS FINAL SEASON OF AMERICAN IDOL WILL DOUBLE AS AN EXERCISE IN MAKING YOU FEEL REALLY DAMN OLD. BUT THAT??S ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF THIS SHOW??S DRAWS: THE BOUNDLESS OPTIMISM OF CROONING PIMPLED CHERUBS WHOSE DREAMS HAVE YET TO BE CRUSHED BY THE REAL WORLD AND ITS RESPONSIBILITIES JADED PRACTICALITY AND CUBICLES. IT??S WHY 15-YEAR-OLD JENEVE MITCHELL 15-YEAR-OLD LEE JEAN AND 20-YEAR-OLD SONIKA VAID WERE SUCH HIGHLIGHTS.

EVERYBODY. A SUPERCUT OF SOB STORIES FOLLOWED A CLIP PACKAGE OF THE SHOW??S MOST EGREGIOUS EXPLOITATIONS OF CONTESTANTS?? PAST TRAGEDIES THAT TREAD THE LINE BETWEEN SELF-CONGRATULATORY TRIBUTE AND SELF-AWARE MOCKERY. THE PANDERING (PATRONIZING?) BACKSTORIES HAVE LONG BEEN A POINT OF CONTENTION WITH THE SHOW??S CRITICS. SPEECH IMPEDIMENTS! ILLNESS! DEAFNESS! HOMELESSNESS! ORPHANS! OH MY! BLISSFULLY THEY TOOK A BACKSEAT IN THIS PREMIERE TO WHOLESOMENESS. TO THAT REGARD CONSIDER THIS PREMIERE TO BE A PALATE CLEANSER FOR ANYONE WHO WATCHED THE BACHELOR. IN CONTRAST TO THE SHOW IN WHICH A COVEN OF 22-YEAR-OLDS DRUNKENLY FIGHT OVER A MAN WHO HAS MADE OUT WITH AT LEAST THREE GIRLS NAMED LAUREN DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THEIR FACES AMERICAN IDOL PORTRAYS AN AMERICA OVERRUN WITH WORSHIP SERVICE LEADERS 20-YEAR-OLD MARRIED COUPLES GIGGLING BABIES AND FAMILIES WHO THINK NOTHING OF WEARING T-SHIRTS WITH THEIR COUSIN??S FACE ON IT AND DRIVING NINE HOURS TO WATCH THEM AUDITION FOR A REALITY TV SHOW. BY THE TIME MARRIED WORSHIP SERVICE LEADERS (SO MANY CONTESTANTS LISTED THIS AS AN OCCUPATION) AUDITIONED TOGETHER WITH THEIR LITERALLY COOING INFANT ON THEIR HIP EVEN CONNICK HAD TO SAY ??THERE??S TOO MUCH GOODNESS IN HERE RIGHT NOW.? WHICH BRINGS US TO CONNICK (AND LOPEZ AND URBAN). IN ITS EFFORT TO DRAW VIEWERS WITH BIG-NAME CELEBRITY TALENT AND KEEP UP WITH THE VOICE??S TRUMPETING OF JUDGES OVER COMPETITORS IDOL HAS OFFERED UP SOME JUDGING PANEL STINKERS. (THAT ELLEN FIASCO.) THE BEAUTY OF THE CURRENT PANEL IS THAT THEY??RE NOT ATTEMPTING TO RECREATE ANY SORT OF PAULA-SIMON PLAYFUL-ANTAGONISTIC MAGIC OR EVEN STEAL FOCUS FOR ANY OTHER REASON THAN IT IS THEIR JOB TO OFFER OPINIONS AFTER EACH PERFORMANCE. THEY ARE SIMPLY POLITE. (??THAT WAS NICE!? WAS PROBABLY THE MOST COMMON CRITIQUE.) AND THEY ARE FUN. (AT ONE POINT THEY ALL STARTED SINGING OLD TV THEME SONGS OUT OF BOREDOM.) YOU LIKE WATCHING THEM. THEY??RE NOT STRESSFUL LIKE MARIAH CAREY AND NICKI MINAJ OR NONSENSICAL LIKE STEVEN TAYLOR. THEY ARE PLEASANT AND PRETTY AND OFFER VALID ADVICE ABOUT BEING A MUSICIAN AND A PERFORMER. THE PREMIERE ENDED WITH TWO BIG PERSONALITIES THAT WILL PROBABLY DOMINATE THE DAY-AFTER PRESS. THE FIRST WAS 23-YEAR-OLD HAIRDRESSER SHELBIE ??Z? JAMES. SHE BLEW THE ROOF OFF THE PLACE WITH HER PERFORMANCE OF ??LAST NAME? ALL CARRIE UNDERWOOD CHARISMA AND CONTROL WITH MIRANDA LAMBERT GRIT.

THE QUILLIAM FOUNDATION FOUNDED BY DAILY BEAST CONTRIBUTOR AND COUNTER-EXTREMISM EXPERT MAAJID NAWAZ PUBLISHED A REPORT IN 2013 TITLED ??IT??S SALAFI-JIHADIST INSURGENCY STUPID!? IN 2014 FOUR GIRLS LEFT CANADA TO JOIN ISIS AFTER STUDY AT THE AL-HUDA INSTITUTE IN MISSISSAUGA ONTARIO.?Ÿ A FEW MONTHS AGO THE TONY BLAIR FAITH FOUNDATION PUBLISHED A REPORT ??INSIDE THE JIHADI MIND? DISSECTING THE PROPAGANDA AND IDEOLOGY OF ??SALAFI-JIHADISM? WITH THEMES OF ??THE NOBILITY OF JIHAD? THE ??END OF HUMILIATION? AND THE ??DISGRACE OF ENEMIES.? RESEARCHERS INCLUDING TERRORISM EXPERT EMMAN EL-BADAWY SAID THEY FOUND ISLAMIC TEACHINGS IN 87 PERCENT OF THE PROPAGANDA OF ??SALAFI-JIHADISM? THAT THEY STUDIED. OVER FOUR DECADES I??AND DOZENS OF OTHER MUSLIMS WITH WHOM I HAVE SPOKEN??HAVE SEEN THE SPIRIT OF RELIGIOUS DOGMATISM OVERTAKE THE LIVES OF LOVED ONES AS THE GOVERNMENTS OF SAUDI ARABIA AND QATAR HAVE EXPORTED THEIR STATE RELIGION OF SALAFISM TO THE WORLD. THEY ARE BUTTRESSED BY THE TEACHINGS OF ISLAMIST IDEOLOGUES LIKE SYED QUTB THE GODFATHER OF THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD IN EGYPT MAULANA MAWDUDI A GODFATHER OF ISLAMIST MOVEMENTS IN PAKISTAN INDIA AND BANGLADESH LIKE TABLIGHI JAMAAT AND JAAMAT ISLAMI AND ABDULLAH AZZAM TEACHER TO A GENERATION OF AFGHAN AND PAKISTANI FIGHTERS INCLUDING AL-QAEDA LEADERS OSAMA BIN LADIN AND AYMAN AL ZAWAHIRI.. KEY TO THEIR MOST EXTREME TEACHINGS IS THE ROMANTICIZATION OF ??JIHAD AND MARTYRDOM.? WHEN I FIRST ARRIVED IN PAKISTAN IN THE SUMMER OF 1983 I SAW THE FIRST INKLINGS OF THIS IDEOLOGY THROUGH A FEMALE COUSIN A DEAR PEN PAL OF MINE. SHE WAS STARTING TO GET INFLUENCED BY THE SAUDI ISLAMIZATION OF PAKISTAN WHICH STARTED WITH THE RISE TO POWER OF GENERAL ZIA UL HAQ IN 1977 AND THE RADICALIZING OF U.S.-SPONSORED AFGHAN WARRIORS INTO ??MUJAHIDEEN? FIGHTING THE SOVIETS WITH THE USSR??S INVASION OF AFGHANISTAN IN 1979. DURING THAT TIME SALAFI IDEOLOGY CROSS-FERTILIZED WITH A TRADITIONALLY CONSERVATIVE IDEOLOGY OF SOUTH ASIA CALLED DEOBANDISM. THE DEOBANDI IDEOLOGY IS NAMED FOR A VILLAGE IN MY NATIVE STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH IN NORTHERN INDIA WHERE THE SCHOOL IS BASED AT THE UNIVERSITY DARUL ULOOM DEOBAND OR ??HOUSE OF KNOWLEDGE DEOBAND.? I HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO STUDIED THERE AND ITS ULTRACONSERVATIVE DOGMATISM INFLUENCED MY PATERNAL AND MATERNAL LINEAGE WITH MY MOTHER AS A RISING TEEN HAVING TO WEAR THE BLACK FACE VEIL AND BURKA OR GOWN. MILITANT DEOBANDISM HAS BECOME THE IDEOLOGY OF THE AFGHAN TALIBAN AND PAKISTANI MILITANT GROUPS. MY PEN PAL RETREATED AWAY FROM PLAYING LATE-NIGHT GAMES OF GIN RUMMY WITH OUR MALE FIRST COUSINS BECAUSE BY CONSERVATIVE INTERPRETATIONS OF ISLAM WHERE ONE CAN MARRY FIRST COUSINS THEY WERE SUDDENLY HARAM (FORBIDDEN OR ILLEGAL) TO HER THEY WERE POTENTIAL MARITAL PARTNERS. BACK IN THE U.S. IN THE EARLY 1990S I GOT DISTURBING NEWS ONE DAY FROM MY MOTHER THAT A COUSIN IN GAITHERSBURG MARYLAND??INDOCTRINATED TO EXTREMIST ISLAM THROUGH THE TABLIGHI JAMAAT A MISSIONARY GROUP FOUNDED OUTSIDE DELHI AS AN OFFSHOOT OF DEOBANDISM??HAD TAKEN HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN TO INDIA ON A RUSE AND SEIZED THEIR PASSPORTS REFUSING TO LET THEM RETURN TO AMERICA. THE STORY WAS HE HAD SEEN A NOTE FROM HIS DAUGHTER INDICATING SHE HAD A CRUSH ON A WHITE BOY AT SCHOOL AND HE DIDN??T WANT HIS CHILDREN ??CORRUPTED.? THEY REMAINED IN INDIA. NOT LONG AGO ONE SON RETURNED TO THE UNITED STATES. THE DAUGHTER A STAR COLLEGE GRADUATE IN INDIA GOT MARRIED AND LIVES IN SAUDI ARABIA WEARING A FULL-FACE VEIL BY ??CHOICE.? BACK IN PAKISTAN ??DR. FARHAT? STARTED AL-HUDA IN 1994 INDOCTRINATING WOMEN BY THE THOUSANDS TO HER HYPER-RELIGIOUS DOCTRINE. BORN IN THE PROVINCE OF PUNJAB IN PAKISTAN SHE EARNED A PHD IN HADITH STUDIES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF GLASGOW AND TAUGHT AT THE INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIC UNIVERSITY IN ISLAMABAD LARGELY INFLUENCED BY SAUDI SALAFI IDEOLOGY. IN FACT SAUDI ARABIA??S LATE LEADER FAISAL DONATED A TOWERING MOSQUE IN ISLAMABAD TO THE UNIVERSITY. SOON SOME HUSBANDS OF DR. FARHAT??S PUPILS WERE PROTESTING THAT THEIR WIVES HAD BECOME ??EXTREMIST.? WHEN I WENT TO PAKISTAN AFTER THE 9/11 ATTACKS I SAW MY PEN-PAL COUSIN HAD GROWN EVEN MORE RIGID IN HER RELIGIOSITY NOW WEARING A TIGHT HEADSCARF AND MY AUNTS OTHERWISE LIBERAL WHEN GROWING UP IN OUR NATIVE INDIA HAD STARTED TO COVER THEIR FACES IN BLACK VEILS AND SHROUD THEIR BODIES IN BLACK BURKAS??JUST LIKE THE NEWLY-MARRIED TAFSHEEN MALIK DID WHEN SHE ARRIVED YEARS LATER IN THE UNITED STATES ACCORDING TO THE SECURITY CAMERA PHOTO RELEASED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. FOR THE MEN WHO FOLLOWED THEIR WIVES?? LEADS THEY GREW THEIR BEARDS BUT SHAVED THEIR MOUSTACHES FOLLOWING DOCTRINE PROMOTED ON SALAFI WEBSITES THAT A HADITH OR TRADITION OF THE PROPHET MUHAMMAD HOLDS THAT GROWING THE MUSTACHE IS HARAM.?Ÿ IN SOUTH ASIA THE SCHOOL OF THOUGHT ASSOCIATED WITH SALAFI ARE ??AHL AL-HADITH? OR THE ??PEOPLE WITH THE HADITH? WITH A LITERAL AND STRICT VIEW OF HADITH. IF THE ALPHABET SOUP OF NAMES IS CONFUSING THAT??S BECAUSE EXTREMIST ISLAMIST IDEOLOGIES JUST LIKE ANYTHING ARE FILLED WITH COMPETITION RIVALRIES AND POWER PLAYS. ONE FACEBOOK USER TAKES A SWATH THROUGH THE GROUPS WITH THIS PAGE: ??WE SUNNIS MUST UNITE TO FIGHT WAHABI/SALAFI/DEOBANDI TABLIG JAMAT TERRORISM.? IN KARACHI I SAW THE FACE OF THE DEOBANDI MILITANCY IN THE FACES OF THE MEN WHO KIDNAPPED MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE WALL STREET JOURNAL DANNY PEARL. WHEN I SAW A POLICE REPORT ON ONE SUSPECT ON THE LINE FOR RELIGION THE POLICE HADN??T WRITTEN ??MUSLIM? OR ??SUNNI? OR ??SHIA.? THEY HAD WRITTEN ??DEOBANDI.? THEY KNEW. AND MEANWHILE HIS KIDNAPPER OMAR SHEIKH HAD BEEN INDOCTRINATED BY RADICAL SALAFI CLERICS IN LONDON. AND HIS ALLEGED MURDERER KHALID SHEIKH MOHAMMED OR ??KSM? HAD STUDIED UNDER THE RESPECTED SALAFI SCHOLARS OF THE AFGHAN MUJAHIDEEN AND IN FACT IN 1996 WHEN FBI AGENT FRANK PELLEGRINO LANDED IN DOHA QATAR A SALAFI STATE TO ARREST KSM THE FUTURE MASTERMIND OF THE 9/11 ATTACKS WAS ALERTED BY SOMEONE IN AUTHORITY AND ESCAPED EXTRADITION TO THE UNITED STATES. U.S. AUTHORITIES WERE THAT CLOSE TO STOPPING THE 9/11 PLANNING BEFORE THEY HAD EVEN BEGUN. LIKE THE CLUE THAT I GOT WHEN I SAW THE ??LIKE? FOR AL-HUDA INTERNATIONAL WHEN I HEARD THE NAME OF THE SAN BERNARDINO HUSBAND??S MOSQUE????DAR AL ULOOM AL-ISLMIYAH OF AMERICA???MY HEART SANK. I KNEW THE HUSBAND WAS IMMERSED IN A VERY RIGID ISLAM AKIN TO THE DEOBANDI IDEOLOGY THAT HAS CROSS-FERTILIZED WITH ??SALAFI JIHADISTS.? WITH OR WITHOUT FORMAL AFFILIATION WITH THE MOSQUE IN INDIA DARUL ULOOM DEOBAND WE KNOW IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT A ??DARUL ULOOM? MOSQUE FOLLOWS A HYPER-CONSERVATIVE ISLAM CONNECTED TO DEOBANDI OR SALAFI ISLAM OR BOTH. MOSQUE OFFICIALS DIDN'T RETURN MESSAGES SEEKING COMMENT. SALAFI THINKING IS BASED OFF OF THE WRITINGS OF AN 18TH-CENTURY SAUDI SCHOLAR MUHAMMAD IBN?¨ABD AL-WAHHAB. THUS SAUDI THINKING HAS MOST OFTEN BEEN KNOWN AS ??WAHHABISM.? IN THE SALAFI SCHOOL OF THOUGHT ADHERENTS ??PLACE A GREAT EMPHASIS ON LITERAL INTERPRETATION OF THE QUR??AN AND HADITH? OR THE TRADITIONS OF THE PROPHET MUHAMMAD ??WITH SKEPTICISM TOWARD THE ROLE OF HUMAN REASON IN THEOLOGY? ACCORDING TO A RECENTLY-RELEASED REPORT BY THE ROYAL ISLAMIC STRATEGIC STUDIES CENTRE BASED IN AMMAN JORDAN ON THE WORLD??S ??500 MOST INFLUENTIAL MUSLIMS.? SALAFI ADHERENTS TRY TO EMULATE THEIR STRICT UNDERSTANDING OF THE LIVES OF THE SALAF OR THE ??PREDECESSORS? INCLUDING MUHAMMAD AND THE FIRST THREE GENERATIONS IN ISLAM STARTING IN THE 7TH CENTURY. THE REPORT BY JORDAN WHICH OPPOSES SALAFI TEACHINGS SAYS ??ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM? COMPROMISES NINE PERCENT OF THE WORLD??S APPROXIMATELY 2 BILLION MUSLIMS AND IS MADE UP OF MOSTLY ??SALAFI (8%)? AND THE EGYPTIAN ISLAMIST MOVEMENT THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD (1%) AS WELL AS ??REVOLUTIONARY SHI??ISM.? IT DESCRIBES THEM AS FOLLOWING ??A HIGHLY POLITICIZED RELIGIOUS IDEOLOGY? THAT IS ??CHARACTERIZED BY AN AGGRESSIVENESS.? IN THE REPORT NO. 3 ON THE LIST OF THE WORLD??S MOST INFLUENTIAL MUSLIMS IS SAUDI ARABIA??S LEADER SALMAN BIN ABDUL-AZIZ AL-SAUD WITH ??MODERATE SALAFI? LISTED AS HIS ??SCHOOL OF THOUGHT.? HIS OCCUPATION IS ??HEAD OF THE MOST EXTENSIVE ??

MEANWHILE FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY ANNOUNCED THAT THE SAN BERNARDINO SHOOTERS MAY NOT HAVE SUPPORTED ISIS ON SOCIAL MEDIA. AMERICAN MUSLIMS WIDELY SHARED HEADLINES ABOUT THIS RECENT REVELATION WITH ONE FACEBOOK USER DEMANDING ??WHO WILL MAKE RETRACTIONS ABOUT THE SAN BERNARDINO CASE?? THE HEADLINES HOWEVER GLOSSED OVER A MORE IMPORTANT REVELATION BY THE FBI DIRECTOR: IN LATE 2013 BEFORE THEY MARRIED THE COUPLE WAS ??COMMUNICATING ONLINE SHOWING SIGNS IN THAT COMMUNICATION OF THEIR JOINT COMMITMENT TO JIHAD AND MARTYRDOM. THOSE COMMUNICATIONS ARE DIRECT PRIVATE MESSAGES.? THE REVELATION OF THE ??JOINT COMMITMENT TO JIHAD AND MARTYRDOM? UNDERSCORES A SINGULAR POINT THAT UNFORTUNATELY TOO MANY MUSLIM LEADERS STILL WANT TO DENY WITH FLIMSY EXCUSES AND CONSPIRACY THEORIES. BUT MOST OF US IN THE MUSLIM WORLD HAVE SEEN ALL THIS TOO CLEARLY??AND PAINFULLY??OVER THE PAST FOUR DECADES EVER SINCE THE GOVERNMENT OF SAUDI ARABIA STARTED PUMPING OUT THE VIRULENT IDEOLOGY OF SALAFISM??S ??JIHAD INC.? INTO THE WORLD WITH ALL ITS INTOLERANCE RIGIDITY ANTI-WESTERN PREJUDICE HATRED OF ISRAEL SEXISM AND MISOGYNY. THE SAN BERNARDINO COUPLE ARE JUST THE LATEST TO ASCRIBE TO SALAFISM??S VIOLENT BELIEF IN A POLITICAL ISLAM THAT SUPPORTS AN ISLAMIC CALIPHATE WITH A SMALL ??C? IF NOT THE SELF-PROCLAIMED ??ISLAMIC STATE? OF ISIS. THE FBI DIRECTOR DIDN??T SAY WHAT KIND OF ??JIHAD? IT WAS. BUT WE KNOW. IT WASN??T AN IRISH JIHAD. OR A PAGAN JIHAD. IT WAS A VIOLENT ISLAMIST JIHAD ROOTED IN THE MOST INTOLERANT EXPRESSIONS OF SALAFISM. ON THE NIGHT OF THE SAN BERNARDINO ATTACKS SEEING THE ??LIKE? OF ??DR. FARHAT? BY TAFSHEEN MALIK??S MOTHER-IN-LAW TOOK ME BACK TO THE WOMEN??S HALAQA OR QURAN STUDY CIRCLE SESSIONS THAT I ATTENDED IN ISLAMABAD IN THE DAYS AFTER THE 9/11 ATTACKS MEETING THE MIDDLE-CLASS AND UPPER MIDDLE-CLASS PAKISTANI WOMEN WHO WERE DEVOTED ALHUDA STUDENTS. THEY BRAGGED ABOUT THE ??GLOW? OF PIETY ON THE FACE OF THEIR TEACHER. ?Ÿ IN THEIR HALAQA MEETINGS THEY PRAYED FEVERISHLY AGAINST THE WEST. THEY LAMBASTED CHRISTIANS AND JEWS. AND THEY SWAPPED THEORIES ABOUT 9/11 ALWAYS CONCLUDING ??THE JEWS DID IT.? THEY SOLD CLOTHES FROM THEIR WEDDING TROUSSEAUS TO RAISE FUNDS FOR TALIBAN AND MUSLIM MILITANTS IN PAKISTAN SUPPORTING THOSE ON THE PATH TO ??JIHAD AND MARTYRDOM.? THAT??S WHY I CALLED THE WOMEN ??THE TALIBAN LADIES AUXILIARY.? AT ONE MEETING A WOMAN SOLD WEDDING TROUSSEAU FINERIES AND SECOND-HAND CLOTHES LIKE A SHOCKING PINK FABRIC WITH FLOWERS TAGGED AS ??SUIT PIECE 200 RUPEES? TO RAISE FUNDS FOR THE MUJAHEDIN?ŸFIGHTING THE WEST. THE SCHOOL THAT TAFSHEEN MALIK ATTENDED ALSO TEACHES MUSLIM WOMEN THAT THEY SHOULD WEAR THE?ŸNIQAB OR FACE VEIL. THE CLASSES SO SICKENED ME THAT I FLED TO KARACHI WHERE ALAS MILITANTS TOOK THAT SAME HATE AGAINST JEWS TO JUSTIFY KILLING MY FRIEND DANNY WHO WAS JEWISH. THIS FALL ON THE NIGHT OF THE PARIS ATTACKS I WALKED ONTO THE SET OF HBO??S ??REAL TIME? HOSTED BY BILL MAHER A LIBERAL COMEDIAN WHO HAS BEEN A LEADER IN THE U.S.??FORCING A CONVERSATION ABOUT ISLAMIC EXTREMISM DESPITE BEING VILIFIED BY APOLOGISTS??AND I URGED VIEWERS ??WAKE UP!? TO THE THREAT OF ISLAMIC EXTREMIST IDEOLOGY TO THE WEST. I NOTED ??WE HAVE TO BE HONEST ABOUT THE FACT THAT THERE IS AN IDEOLOGY OF ISLAM THAT IS OUR WAR OF OUR GENERATION AND THIS IS AN IDEOLOGY THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS AND WE HAVE TO ADDRESS IT WITH MORAL COURAGE.? SINCE THEN I HAVE HEARD FROM HUNDREDS OF VIEWERS WHO ARE HEEDING THE CALL TO ACTION NOT OUT OF ANY IRRATIONAL FEAR OF ISLAM OR MUSLIMS BUT BECAUSE THEY LIKE ME WANT RATIONAL THREAT ASSESSMENT AND EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS WHICH SHOULD INCLUDE AN ISLAMIC REFORMATION IN WHICH A PROGRESSIVE INTERPRETATION OF ISLAM BECOMES NORMATIVE. THIS PAST DECEMBER I STOOD WITH OTHER COURAGEOUS MUSLIM WOMEN AND MEN IN WASHINGTON D.C. TO LAUNCH THE MUSLIM REFORM MOVEMENT TO CHALLENGE ??VIOLENT ISLAMIST IDEOLOGY? BY WHATEVER NAMES WE CALL IT.

1171,10284065.0,2016-01-26T05:01:00+00:00,TRUMP IS THE MOST ELECTABLE REPUBLICAN. REALLY.,WE??VE SEEN A NUMBER OF HEADLINES IN RECENT WEEKS SAYING THAT GIVEN A CHOICE BETWEEN TED CRUZ AND DONALD TRUMP MUCH OF THE REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT WILL GO WITH THE LATTER. THE NATIONAL REVIEW??S RECENT ONSLAUGHT AGAINST TRUMP HAS OBSCURED THIS A BIT BUT IT IS STILL WORTH DISSECTING BECAUSE THE HUNCH NOW HELD BY A NUMBER OF THE GOP??S PARTY REGULARS IS THAT TRUMP IS THE MOST ELECTABLE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE IN THE RUNNING. AND THIS ANALYSIS INCREASINGLY COMMON IN PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH D.C. REPUBLICANS BUT RARELY VOICED IN PUBLIC HAS SOMEWHAT COUNTER-INTUITIVELY A LOT GOING FOR IT. THE BIG TRUMP ADVANTAGE IS THAT HE HAS NO ACTUAL IDEOLOGY. WHY IS THAT SEEMING MINUS A PLUS? BECAUSE THE FACT THAT THE GUY HAS SHOWN ZERO APTITUDE FOR UNDERSTANDING POLICY MEANS THAT IN A GENERAL ELECTION HE??D NEED TO PROVIDE SOME REAL SPECIFICS ABOUT WHAT HE INTENDS TO DO AS PRESIDENT. NORMALLY CANDIDATES CAN RELY ON SOME IN-HOUSE BRAIN TRUST TO PROVIDE HIM OR HER WITH THE GRITTY DETAILS. BUT TRUMP DOESN??T HAVE ONE OF THOSE EITHER AND APPEARS ALMOST ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON THE EXPERTS HE SEES BY HIS OWN DESCRIPTION ON ??THE SHOWS.? THE GOP??S RULING CLASS FOR ALL OF ITS MANY DEFICIENCIES ISN??T SHORT ON THOUGHT-OUT POLICY POSITIONS OR WHITE PAPERS. SO SHOULD TRUMP BECOME THE NOMINEE ITS MEMBERS ARE ASSUMING THEY CAN TUTOR HIM. HE??LL NEED SUBSTANCE AND THEY THINK THEY CAN PROVIDE IT. PLUS UNLIKE CRUZ TRUMP HAS NO DISCERNABLE IDEOLOGICAL FOUNDATION SO ALL THEY WOULD NEED TO DO IS CONVINCE HIM IT??S IN HIS BEST INTEREST TO KEEP SOUNDING LIKE A BRASH LAW-AND-ORDER POPULIST EVEN AS HE QUIETLY EMBRACES THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION??S VIEWS ON TAX POLICY. AND TRUMP??S IDEOLOGICAL LOOSENESS ALSO HAS ONE OTHER CENTRAL ADVANTAGE AND THIS IS ONE YOU WON??T EVER HEAR ANYONE SAY OVER AT HERITAGE: HE ISN??T A CONSERVATIVE AND CONSERVATIVES HAVE A TERRIBLE TRACK RECORD AT GETTING ELECTED PRESIDENT IN THE POST-REAGAN ERA. THERE WAS GEORGE W. BUSH SURE BUT LET??S REMEMBER THE MISHEGOSS OF THE 2000 ELECTION WHICH CAN POLITELY BE CALLED A TIE AND THEN 2004 THE ONLY TIME THE GOP HAS WON THE POPULAR VOTE SINCE 1988. YES BUSH WON BUT BY AN EXCEEDINGLY NARROW MARGIN IN THE MIDST OF A BOOM ECONOMY AND A WAR JUST THREE YEARS AFTER A CATASTROPHIC AND UNIFYING TERROR ATTACK AND ONLY AGAINST A FLAT-FOOTED DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE. THE TYPICAL CONSERVATIVE REFRAIN HERE IS THAT ALL THE NOMINEES SINCE REAGAN HAVEN??T BEEN CONSERVATIVE ENOUGH??AN EXCUSE THAT AT THIS POINT IS A TOUGH SELL EVEN TO MOST SELF-DESCRIBED CONSERVATIVES. TRUMP WHO HAS A LONG RECORD OF SUPPORTING LIBERAL POSITIONS ON JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER CAN START SOUNDING LIKE A MODERATE IN A REAL HURRY IF HE NEEDS TO. REMEMBER THAT THIS IS A GUY WHO PACKAGED HIMSELF AS A CENTER-LEFT SORT STANDING UP TO PAT BUCHANAN??S EXTREMISM WHEN HE LAST FLIRTED WITH A PRESIDENTIAL BID. AND WHILE WE ALL ASSOCIATE TRUMP NOW WITH RADICAL POSITIONS ON MUSLIMS AND IMMIGRANTS IT??S EASY TO PICTURE HIM SUDDENLY SOUNDING SQUISHY ON JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE. ON THAT NOTE I WONDER HOW MANY OF HIS SUPPORTERS VIEW TRUMP THE GUY WITH A DECADES-LONG HABIT OF BRAGGING ABOUT ALL THE WOMEN HE??S SLEPT WITH AS A SINCERELY PRO-LIFE CANDIDATE. THE ANSWER IS PROBABLY FEWER THAN YOU THINK: OVER THE SUMMER ANN COULTER MUSED THAT SHE WOULD BE FINE WITH HIM PERFORMING ABORTIONS IN THE OVAL OFFICE AS LONG AS HE ENDED ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. AND IT WOULD BE UNDERSTANDABLE TO ASSUME THAT HE WOULD BRING THE SAME FLEXIBILITY TO GAY RIGHTS AND GUNS AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN SO LONG AS HE ASSUMES IT??S IN HIS BEST INTEREST TO DO SO. TRUMP??S IMMIGRATION STANCE HAS BEEN SO ESSENTIAL TO HIS APPEAL THAT HE??LL LIKELY HAVE TO STICK WITH IT BUT THERE??S NO REASON WHY HE WOULDN??T BE WILLING TO NEGOTIATE ON JUST ABOUT ANY OTHER ISSUE. IF YOU??RE A CONSERVATIVE POLICY WONK THIS IS ALL HOW TO PUT IT LESS-THAN-IDEAL. BUT IF YOU??RE A REPUBLICAN WHO??S REALLY INTERESTED IN WINNING TRUMP STARTS MAKING MORE AND MORE SENSE AS A NOMINEE. HE WOULD SCRAMBLE THE DECK IN A GENERAL AND PERHAPS OVERPERFORM WITH BLACK VOTERS A CONSTITUENCY THAT DEMOCRATS RELY ON SO HEAVILY THAT A SMALL CHANGE IN POLLING IN A PLACE LIKE OHIO CAN HAND THE ELECTION TO THE GOP. HE MIGHT NOT DO AS BADLY WITH LATINOS AS MANY EXPECT AND HE COULD WIN SO MUCH OF THE WHITE VOTE AS TO MAKE UP FOR WHAT HE LOSES EVERYWHERE ELSE. ALL OF THIS IS HYPOTHETICAL BUT THE POINT IS THIS: WE DO HAVE AN IDEA OF HOW WELL A TYPICAL CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE WOULD DO IN A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND IT??S PROBABLY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF 220 OR SO ELECTORAL VOTES BUT WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW TRUMP WOULD PERFORM. HE COULD DO EVEN WORSE THAN THAT NUMBER??BUT HE COULD SURPASS IT TOO. AFTER ALL TRUMP IS NECK-AND-NECK WITH HILLARY IN PENNSYLVANIA A STATE ESSENTIAL TO DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL AMBITIONS AND COMPETITIVE WITH HER IN SOLID BLUE STATES LIKE MICHIGAN. IF HE WINS THE NOMINATION HE WILL HAVE DONE SO BY THROWING OUT THE RULEBOOK AND UPENDING WHAT WE THOUGHT WE KNEW ABOUT HOW CANDIDATES ARE SUPPOSED TO CAMPAIGN. HE WOULD ENTER THE GENERAL AS A GIANT QUESTION MARK THE MAN WHO BELIEVES IN SEEMINGLY NOTHING BUT HIS OWN ABILITY TO WIN WHATEVER THE COST WHILE HAVING ALREADY PROVEN THAT HE CAN GET PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY GO AND VOTE FOR HIM. IF THE IDEA OF A NATIONALIST DEMAGOGUE BEING EMBRACED BY CONSERVATIVE INFLUENCERS BECAUSE THEY THINK THEY CAN CONTROL HIM SETS OFF CERTAIN HISTORICAL ALARM BELLS WELL IT PROBABLY SHOULD. BUT BY JETTISONING MUCH OF MODERN CONSERVATIVE PHILOSOPHY WHILE SEIZING CONTROL OF THE GOP??S STILL-CONSIDERABLE INFRASTRUCTURE THERE??S SIMPLY NO KNOWING HOW WELL HE COULD DO IN A GENERAL ELECTION. AND FOR A REPUBLICAN PARTY SO USED TO FAILURE AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL TRUMP JUST MIGHT PROVIDE THE ELECTORAL SHAKEUP THEY SO DESPERATELY NEED. THE FLIPSIDE HERE IS THAT TRUMP COULD JUST IMPLODE AFTER HE GETS THE NOMINATION. VOTERS TIRE OF HIS ANTICS REPUBLICANS DEFECT IN DROVES TO HILLARY CLINTON (OR SHOULD HE RUN MIKE BLOOMBERG) AND TRUMP BOTTOMS OUT WITH AROUND A THIRD OF THE POPULAR VOTE. IN FACT THIS MIGHT BE THE BEST SCENARIO FOR REPUBLICANS IN THE LONG RUN OR AT LEAST REPUBLICANS INTERESTED IN KEEPING THE GOP MORE-OR-LESS THE SAME. THE UNSAVORY ELEMENTS TRUMP HAS DREDGED UP WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN ELECTORATE YOUR WHITE NATIONALISTS AND SO FORTH WOULD BE BLAMED FOR THE FAILURE ALLOWING THE ESTABLISHMENTARIANS TO CEMENT THEIR CONTROL OF THE GOP AND KEEP THE CRAZIES IN CHECK COOPTING SOME POPULIST IDEAS WHILE DITCHING THE REST. MAYBE. OR MAYBE TRUMP??S AMORPHOUS POPULISM REALLY DOES HAVE TREMENDOUS APPEAL IN A COUNTRY SO DISTRUSTFUL OF ALL ITS MAJOR INSTITUTIONS THE TWO PARTIES IN PARTICULAR. EITHER WAY IT??S HARD TO SEE WHY TRUMP THE OVEREXPOSED UNKNOWN ISN??T AT LEAST AS ELECTABLE AS ANY OF THE ACTUAL CONSERVATIVES HE??S RUNNING AGAINST.?Ÿ ,46960.0

ANTHONY WEINER THE FORMER CONGRESSMAN AND ONE-TIME NEW YORK CITY MAYORAL FRONTRUNNER TOLD THE DAILY BEAST ON SUNDAY THAT THE PROSPECT OF MICHAEL BLOOMBERG RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IS NOT SO FAR-FETCHED. ??I SUPPOSE HE COULD WIN? WEINER SAID CONSIDERING A POTENTIAL THREE-MAN RACE BETWEEN BLOOMBERG DONALD TRUMP AND BERNIE SANDERS. A REPORT FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES ON SATURDAY LAID OUT THE CONDITIONS FOR A BLOOMBERG RUN WHICH WOULD BE PREDICATED ON A VICTORY FROM TRUMP OR TED CRUZ ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE AND A WIN FROM SANDERS FOR THE DEMOCRATS. BLOOMBERG IS ALLEGEDLY BIDING HIS TIME TO SEE HOW THE EARLY STATES VOTE ALLOWING HIM TO INJECT A LOT OF HIS OWN ENORMOUS WEALTH INTO A POTENTIAL BID BY MARCH. WEINER WHOSE WIFE HUMA ABEDIN IS A LONG-TIME AIDE FOR HILLARY CLINTON SUGGESTED THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE MAY BE GIRDING THEMSELVES FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF A TRUMP VS. SANDERS GENERAL ELECTION. ??PREPARATIONS FOR THE TRUMP BERNIE SCENARIO ARE PROBABLY AFOOT IN LOTS OF PLACES? WEINER SAID DESCRIBING IN HIS MIND THE ONLY POSSIBLE SITUATION IN WHICH BLOOMBERG WOULD ENTER THE RACE. WHEN ASKED HOW BLOOMBERG COULD MAKE AN IMPACT WITH HIS PLANNED POLICY-ORIENTED CANDIDACY IN A RACE THAT HAS BEEN DOMINATED BY LOUD AND NONSPECIFIC NATIVISM WEINER SAID THAT BLOOMBERG??S ??COCKTAIL BUDDIES? ARE ??GOP BIG WIGS.??Ÿ THE PROBLEM FOR BLOOMBERG IS TIMING AS EARLY MARCH MARKS THE DEADLINE SET BY HIS ADVISERS TO BE ABLE TO GET HIM ON THE BALLOT IN ALL FIFTY STATES. AND AT THIS POINT ACCORDING TO WEINER IT??S JUST A WAITING GAME. ??IF BERNIE AND TRUMP BOTH WIN IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE THEN HE STARTS MOVING AND THEN AFTER THE SEC [PRIMARY] HE GOES IN? WEINER SAID. AT THIS STAGE THE RACE IN IOWA ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE IS ESSENTIALLY A DEAD HEAT BETWEEN SANDERS AND CLINTON WITH THE FORMER EDGING HER OUT SLIGHTLY. IN NEW HAMPSHIRE SANDERS HAS RETAINED A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT LEAD IN A NUMBER OF POLLS.?Ÿ ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE EVEN THOUGH CRUZ HAD BECOME THE PRESUMED WINNER OF IOWA IN THE LAST MONTH TRUMP HAS SINCE GAINED ON HIM WHILE KEEPING A HUGE LEAD IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. SO THE IDEA THAT THE CRITERIA WOULD EXIST FOR BLOOMBERG TO MAKE A LATE ENTRY IS NOT COMPLETELY UNFORESEEN. ??BUT NOT IF HILLARY IS IN OK SHAPE? WEINER SAID CITING A REASON THAT WOULD KEEP BLOOMBERG FROM ENTERING EVEN IF SANDERS WINS BOTH IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE. WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT IS ANYONE??S GUESS BUT WHEN ASKED IF HE THINKS SANDERS CAN KEEP UP THE MOMENTUM OF HIS PROSPECTIVE IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE WINS TO GET THE NOMINATION WEINER SIMPLY SAID ??NO.? ,9318.0

253,9692659.0,2016-01-06T23:20:00+00:00,ALABAMA CHIEF JUSTICE SCREWED 66 JUDGES,DEFYING HISTORY THE LAW AND COMMON SENSE ALABAMA CHIEF JUSTICE ROY MOORE HAS ISSUED AN ORDER PROHIBITING ALABAMA PROBATE JUDGES FROM ISSUING MARRIAGE LICENSES TO SAME-SEX COUPLES. THOSE JUDGES NOW FACE A CHOICE BETWEEN DISOBEYING THE LAW OF THE LAND AND DISOBEYING THEIR BOSS. MOORE ISSUED HIS LAW NOT AS CHIEF JUSTICE BUT IN HIS ADMINISTRATIVE ROLE AS HEAD OF THE ALABAMA COURT SYSTEM. THIS IS NOT JUSTICE MOORE??S FIRST HAIL MARY IN THE LOST CAUSE AGAINST GAY MARRIAGE??AND HE??S NOT ALONE. ALL OVER THE COUNTRY ACTIVISTS AND LAW PROFESSORS ARE WASTING PAPER ON FATUOUS PROCLAMATIONS THAT OBERGEFELL V. HODGES IS NOT REALLY THE LAW OF THE LAND OR IS ILLEGITIMATE BECAUSE IT??S SO HORRIBLE OR IS SOMEHOW SOME WAY NOT AS BINDING AS THE SUPREME COURT SAID IT WAS. ROY MOORE IS JUST THE ONLY ONE WHO??S A STATE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. AS WITH MOORE??S PAST EFFORTS TO DELAY THE INEVITABLE TODAY??S ORDER WAS A M??LANGE OF THE SENSIBLE AND THE RISIBLE. ON THE SENSIBLE SIDE JUSTICE MOORE DOES HAVE SOME LAW ON HIS SIDE??IN FACT THREE EXTREMELY NARROW TECHNICAL THREADS ON WHICH HE HANGS HIS ORDER. FIRST TECHNICALLY SPEAKING OBERGEFELL ONLY BOUND THE FIVE STATES THAT WERE A PARTY TO IT. SINCE ALABAMA WAS NOT ONE OF THOSE STATES TECHNICALLY ITS LAW IS CAUGHT IN LIMBO. SECOND THE ALABAMA SUPREME COURT UPHELD ITS SAME-SEX MARRIAGE BAN ON MARCH 3 2015. AND THIRD INJUNCTIONS STEMMING FROM TWO FEDERAL CASES CHALLENGING THE BAN ARE AS MOORE OPINED LAST FEBRUARY ONLY BINDING ON THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH NOT THE JUDICIAL BRANCH??WHICH INCLUDES PROBATE JUDGES. THIS APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN AN OVERSIGHT THE RESULT OF A PLEADING ERROR BY ONE OF THE PARTIES. BUT RATHER THAN EXTEND THEM IN A COMMON-SENSE WAY MOORE CHOSE TO RESTRICT THEM IN A NONSENSICAL ONE. SO AS THREE HYPER-TECHNICAL MATTERS OF LAW OBERGEFELL DOESN??T GOVERN THE ALABAMA CASE STANDS AND THE FEDERAL INJUNCTION DOESN??T APPLY. BUT THAT??S WHERE IT ALL BECOMES LAUGHABLE??IF NOT OUTRIGHT DISHONEST. IT IS COMPLETELY OBVIOUS THAT THE OBERGEFELL DECISION DOES INDEED GOVERN ALL 50 STATES. THE LOGIC IT APPLIED TO MICHIGAN IS EQUALLY APPLICABLE TO ALABAMA. THAT??S WHY LGBT ACTIVISTS BROKE OUT THE CHAMPAGNE LAST JUNE. IT??S ALSO WHY JUDGES AND CLERKS AROUND THE COUNTRY WITH ONLY A HANDFUL OF EXCEPTIONS LIKE KIM DAVIS HAVE APPLIED THE LAW AND GRANTED SAME-SEX MARRIAGE LICENSES FOR MONTHS NOW. EVEN THE CASES UPON WHICH MOORE RELIES IN FACT CONTRADICT HIM. FOR EXAMPLE MOORE CITES AN EIGHTH CIRCUIT CASE DECIDED ON AUGUST 11 THAT SAID ??THE [OBERGEFELL] COURT INVALIDATED LAWS IN MICHIGAN KENTUCKY OHIO AND TENNESSEE??NOT NEBRASKA.? BUT THAT CASE AFFIRMED NOT REJECTED THE RIGHT TO SAME-SEX MARRIAGE IN NEBRASKA AND FORBADE NEBRASKA FROM BLOCKING IT WHILE THE COURT CASE WOUND DOWN TO ITS INEVITABLE CONCLUSION. THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. WHEN THE SUPREME COURT RULES ON AN ISSUE IT DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY END ALL THE CASES THAT DEAL WITH IT. BUT IT DOES MAKE THEIR OUTCOMES OBVIOUS. SO WHILE THE LEGAL MATTERS ARE FORMALLY RESOLVED LOWER COURTS ISSUE OR STAY INJUNCTIONS IN LIGHT OF THE SUPREME COURT RULING. FOR EXAMPLE WHEN THE SUPREME COURT OUTLAWED MISCEGENATION BANS IN 1967 THOSE BANS TECHNICALLY REMAINED ON THE BOOKS IN 16 STATES AND MANY WERE NOT REPEALED UNTIL QUITE RECENTLY. BUT COURTS IMMEDIATELY ISSUED INJUNCTIONS FORBIDDING THE ENFORCEMENT OF THOSE LAWS. TO TAKE ANOTHER EXAMPLE MANY OF THE SODOMY LAWS AT ISSUE IN LAWRENCE V. TEXAS ARE TECHNICALLY STILL ON THE BOOKS. BUT COURTS EVERYWHERE HAVE PROHIBITED THEIR ENFORCEMENT. OBERGEFELL OBVIOUSLY??LAUGHABLY OBVIOUSLY??IS SIMILAR. AS THE SUPREME COURT WROTE ??THE RIGHT TO MARRY IS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT INHERENT IN THE LIBERTY OF THE PERSON AND UNDER THE DUE PROCESS AND EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSES OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT COUPLES OF THE SAME-SEX MAY NOT BE DEPRIVED OF THAT RIGHT AND THAT LIBERTY. THE COURT NOW HOLDS THAT SAME-SEX COUPLES MAY EXERCISE THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO MARRY. NO LONGER MAY THIS LIBERTY BE DENIED TO THEM?? THE STATE LAWS CHALLENGED BY PETITIONERS IN THESE CASES ARE NOW HELD INVALID.? YES AS JUSTICE MOORE ITALICIZES IN HIS ORDER ONLY ??THE STATE LAWS CHALLENGED?? IN THESE CASES? WERE INVALIDATED LAST JUNE. BUT THE REST OF THAT PARAGRAPH OBVIOUSLY APPLIES TO ALL SAME-SEX COUPLES EVERYWHERE. THERE IS NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN THOSE IN ALABAMA AND THOSE IN MICHIGAN AND SO THE LEGAL OUTCOME OF THE ARIZONA CASES IS A FOREGONE CONCLUSION. TO CHERRY-PICK ONE CLAUSE FROM THE ENTIRE PARAGRAPH IS AT BEST FACETIOUS. AND IT??S NOT UNLIKE THE WAY MOORE CITES THAT NEBRASKA CASE: SNIPPING OUT TWO WORDS THAT SUPPORT HIS POSITION AND IGNORING ALL OF THE CONTEXT. WHERE THE LAUGHTER STOPS THOUGH IS IN ALABAMA??S 66 PROBATE COURT OFFICES. THESE JUDGES AND THEIR CLERKS ARE WITH ONLY A HANDFUL OF EXCEPTIONS LOYAL PUBLIC SERVANTS WHO ARE TRYING TO THEIR JOBS. MANY OF THEM PERSONALLY OPPOSE GAY MARRIAGE BUT RECOGNIZE THAT THEY??VE SWORN OATHS TO ENFORCE THE CONSTITUTION NOT THE BIBLE. WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO DO NOW? PERHAPS THE WORST PART OF MOORE??S ODIOUS ORDER IS WHEN HE CITES THE ??CONFUSION? AMONG ALABAMA JUDGES AS IF THAT CONFUSION SIMPLY AROSE ON ITS OWN SOMEHOW. IN FACT HE SOWED IT HIMSELF WITH HIS COURT- AND COMMON-SENSE- DEFYING ORDERS LAST FEBRUARY AND HE HAS WATERED THOSE SEEDS WITH HIS ABSURD HAIR-SPLITTING TODAY. OF COURSE MOORE??S ORDER WILL BE RENDERED NULL AND VOID HOPEFULLY EXPEDITIOUSLY BY A FEDERAL COURT IN ALABAMA FORMALLY CLOSING THE SAME-SEX MARRIAGES CASES STILL PENDING OR EXTENDING THE INJUNCTIONS IN THEM TO JUDICIAL AS WELL AS EXECUTIVE EMPLOYEES. THE TIDE OF HISTORY WILL NOT BE TURNED. BUT IN THE MEANTIME NOT ONLY HAS MOORE DEMEANED EVERY MARRIED COUPLE IN ALABAMA STRAIGHT AND GAY HE HAS ALSO THROWN HIS OWN EMPLOYEES UNDER THE BUS. IF I WERE A PROBATE JUDGE IN BIRMINGHAM I??M NOT SURE WHAT I WOULD DO TOMORROW MORNING. ROY MOORE??S SYMBOLIC SNATCH OF DEMAGOGUERY MAY PLAY WELL AT THE POLLS SOMEDAY. BUT IN THE MEANTIME HE HAS DISRESPECTED ALABAMA??S LGBT CITIZENS DISRESPECTED THE RULE OF LAW AND DISRESPECTED ALL THOSE DOING THEIR BEST TO ENFORCE IT. ,84871.0

FOLLOWING A DISASTROUS TEENAGE ATTEMPT AT HETEROSEXUAL INTERCOURSE IN A MOTEL SIX HE FOLLOWED WHAT HE CALLS AN ??ALMOST STALKER-LEVEL CRAZY? CRUSH ON A MALE MORMON FRIEND STRAIGHT INTO THE HEART OF THE RELIGION. AT AGE 18 HE CONVERTED TO AVOID THE PRESSURE HE FELT TO HAVE SEX WITH WOMEN. IN LGBT LEXICON MORMONISM WAS HIS ??BEARD.? ??I COULD FALL BACK ON THAT OLD CHESTNUT ??I??M WAITING FOR MARRIAGE??? HE TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. NOW A HAPPILY-MARRIED GAY MORMON HUSBAND AND FATHER ANDERSEN HAS TRANSLATED HIS LIFETIME OF EXPERIENCE WITH THE FAITH INTO A COMIC BOOK SERIES ABOUT GAY AND LESBIAN MORMON SUPERHEROES CALLED STRIPLING WARRIOR??A REFERENCE TO A BOOK OF MORMON STORY ABOUT 2000 YOUNG MEN WHO FOUGHT IN AN ANCIENT AMERICAN CIVIL WAR??WITH GORGEOUS ART BY JAMES NEISH. WITH TWO ISSUES RELEASED SO FAR AND ANOTHER FORTHCOMING IN FEBRUARY STRIPLING WARRIOR TELLS THE STORY OF SAMUEL SHEPARD A.K.A. THE HAND OF GOD A GAY MORMON HUSBAND BLESSED BY AN ANGEL WITH THE STRENGTH OF 2000 STRIPLING WARRIORS WHO FIGHTS SINNERS BY NIGHT IN CROTCH-HUGGING SPANDEX. (??IT TOOK ME DAYS TO SEW THIS BOSS OUTFIT? SHEPARD SAYS OF HIS SHINY GETUP.) IN ISSUE TWO SHEPARD JOINS FORCES WITH FE FERNANDEZ A LATINA LESBIAN WHO LEFT THE CHURCH DUE TO HER ??LOVE OF VAGINA? BUT HAS SINCE BEEN GRANTED HOLY SUPERPOWERS AND A NEW NAME: LUZ DE SANTOS HOLY LIGHT. TOGETHER THESE HEROES FACE ENEMIES ON BOTH SIDES: THERE??S CAIN THE BIBLE??S FIRST MURDERER APPARENTLY STILL ALIVE AND STILL JUST AS EVIL AS HE WAS IN GENESIS. AND THERE??S A ROGUE MORMON LEADER WHO UNLEASHES AN ARMY OF HOMOPHOBIC MISSIONARIES TO STOP THE TWO ??APOSTATES.? BUT STRIPLING WARRIOR IS NOT JUST A PLAYFUL AND UNABASHEDLY GAY SUPERHERO STORY IT??S A PARABLE ABOUT A CHURCH THAT IS DEEPLY DIVIDED OVER THE QUESTION OF SAME-SEX MARRIAGE. LAST NOVEMBER IN RESPONSE TO THE LEGALIZATION OF SAME-SEX MARRIAGE THE MORMON CHURCH INSTITUTED A CONTROVERSIAL POLICY CHANGE PROHIBITING ANY CHILD WHO PRIMARILY RESIDES WITH SAME-SEX PARENTS FROM BEING BAPTIZED UNTIL THEY??RE 18??EIGHT IS THE TYPICAL AGE OF BAPTISM??AND ONLY THEN IF THE CHILD ??SPECIFICALLY DISAVOWS THE PRACTICE OF SAME-GENDER COHABITATION AND MARRIAGE.? IT ALSO DEFINED MEMBERS WHO ??ARE IN A SAME-GENDER MARRIAGE???MEMBERS LIKE ANDERSEN AND HIS HUSBAND??AS ??APOSTATES? THREATENING THEM WITH EXCOMMUNICATION. WHEN ASKED IF HE FEARED CHURCH DISCIPLINE FOR CREATING STRIPLING WARRIOR ANDERSEN TOLD THE DAILY BEAST?Ÿ ??NOT AT ALL I??M READY FOR IT. FOR MY HUSBAND AND I THIS [POLICY] WAS THE PROVERBIAL ??LAST STRAW??. I??M JUST SO EXHAUSTED BY THE CHURCH??S EFFORTS TO HARM ME AND MY FAMILY.? APPROXIMATELY 1500 MORMONS PROTESTED THE NEW POLICY BY RESIGNING IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF ITS IMPLEMENTATION. THAT NUMBER HAS ONLY GROWN. THE MORMON CHURCH HAS LONG BEEN OPPOSED TO SAME-SEX MARRIAGE BUT BEFORE NOVEMBER 2015 INTERNAL POLICY WAS LESS HARSH. THE POLICY CHANGE ALSO CAME AT A TIME WHEN ACCEPTANCE OF HOMOSEXUALITY WAS ACTUALLY RISING WITHIN THE FAITH. ACCORDING TO 2014 PEW DATA 36 PERCENT OF MORMONS NOW BELIEVE THAT HOMOSEXUALITY SHOULD BE SOCIALLY ACCEPTED??UP 12 PERCENT FROM 2007. IN STRIPLING WARRIOR ANDERSEN REPRESENTS THIS DIVISION WITHIN MORMONISM IN THE FORM A MISSIONARY CHARACTER WHO RESCUES THE TWO HEROES FROM HIS HOMOPHOBIC PEERS. ??NOT ALL OF US BELIEVE THAT HOMOSEXUALS ARE EVIL? HE TELLS SHEPARD AND FERNANDEZ AFTER INCAPACITATING THE ATTACKING MISSIONARIES. ??I LOVE MY CHURCH I BELIEVE IN THE GOSPEL I SUSTAIN MY FIRST PRESIDENCY BUT I DON??T AGREE THAT A GAY PERSON IS LESS THAN I AM.? ANDERSEN SAID THAT THE CHARACTER WAS MODELED AFTER HIS OWN EXPERIENCES WITH MORMON ALLIES: ??I HAVE A LOT OF VERY GOOD STRAIGHT MORMON FRIENDS WHO ARE DEEPLY CONFLICTED BY THE CHURCH??S ACTIONS TOWARD GAYS. I WANTED TO GIVE THEM A VOICE AS WELL.? BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT STORY ANDERSEN TELLS IN STRIPLING WARRIOR IS HIS OWN. AS A YOUNG MAN HE SERVED A TWO-YEAR MORMON MISSION IN GUATEMALA BEFORE TRYING HIS HAND AT DATING WOMEN AGAIN MAKING EXCUSES??LIKE GARLIC BREATH OR MONO??FOR HIS RELUCTANCE TO KISS THEM. ??ALL THE WHILE I WAS AGONIZING OVER MY LACK OF HETEROSEXUALITY? HE TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. ??THOSE WANNABE STRAIGHT RELATIONSHIPS WERE DOING MORE DAMAGE TO MY MENTAL STATE THAN I COULD HANDLE.? THEN AT AGE 26 WHILE ATTENDING THE MORMON-OWNED BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY ANDERSEN STOPPED RUNNING. ??ONCE I CAME OUT AND EMBRACED MY HOMOSEXUALITY AND HAD SEX FOR THE FIRST TIME IT WAS BOTH LIBERATING AND TERRIFYING? HE SAID. ??IT FELT SO RIGHT AND SO SO SO WRONG. IT WAS BOTH BEAUTIFUL AND SCARY.? IN THE OPENING PAGES OF STRIPLING WARRIOR SHEPARD RECALLS BEING VISITED BY AN ANGEL AFTER HE HAD ??JUST FINISHED HUMPING [HIS] NEW HUSBAND TO SLEEP? AND FEELING ??SURE [HE] WAS ABOUT TO BE PUNISHED FOR TURNING [HIS] BACK ON [HIS] LATTER-DAY FAITH.? AS IT TURNS OUT THE ANGEL WAS THERE TO GIVE HIM SOME AWESOME SUPERPOWERS AND A SWORD FOR SMITING SINNERS. ??THAT COMES DIRECTLY FROM MY OWN PERSPECTIVE AS A NEWLY OUT HOMOSEXUAL MORMON? ANDERSEN TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. ??I THOUGHT I WOULD BE PUNISHED FOR TURNING MY BACK ON A CHURCH I HAD LOVED WITH EVERY FIBER OF MY BEING.? NOW IN HIS FORTIES ANDERSEN AND HIS HUSBAND A LIFELONG MORMON HAVE A TWO-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER WHO WAS BORN VIA SURROGATE. THE NEW MORMON POLICY WILL FORBID HER FROM BEING BAPTIZED UNLESS SHE DISAVOWS HER DADS AS AN ADULT. ??I??VE SINCE REALIZED THAT HOMOSEXUALITY IS A WONDERFUL GIFT? ANDERSEN TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. ??IT??S SO FREEING BEING WHO I AM AND LOVING WHO I LOVE AND LIVING MY LIFE FREE OF THE WEIGHT OF BEING TOLD THAT I AM BAD OR WRONG.? THAT SENSE OF FREEDOM SHOWS IN STRIPLING WARRIOR AS SHEPARD LEAPS THROUGH TOWN PUNISHING A MAN WHO POSTED REVENGE PORN BEFORE GOING BACK HOME TO CUDDLE AND KISS HIS HUNKY HUSBAND.?Ÿ ANDERSEN SAYS THAT HE DOESN??T WANT THE PRO-GAY TONE OF THE COMIC TO COME ACROSS AS ??ANTI-MORMON? BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE DOUBTS THAT THE CHURCH WILL EVER ACCEPT A FAMILY LIKE HIS. SHEPARD ON THE OTHER HAND SEEMS TO BE MORE OPTIMISTIC. LAYING ON HIS HUSBAND??S CHEST AT NIGHT REFLECTING ON WHY AN ??IMPERFECT? MORMON LIKE HIM WAS CHOSEN TO FIGHT FOR GOD THE SUPERHERO IMAGINES A SCENARIO IN WHICH THINGS CHANGE. ??IF ONLY THE GENERAL AUTHORITIES OF THE CHURCH KNEW A FULL-FLEDGED HOMO IS A MODERN-DAY STRIPLING WARRIOR? HE THINKS ??THEIR CATARACTS WOULD BURST FROM THEIR NARROW-MINDED EYES.? STRIPLING WARRIOR IS PUBLISHED BY SO SUPER DUPER COMICS AND AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE IN PRINT AND DIGITAL EDITIONS. ,7331.0

A LOT HAS BEEN HAPPENING TO FORMER OIL TYCOON MIKHAIL KHODORKOVSKY IN RUSSIA SINCE HE LEFT RUSSIA. THE 52-YEAR-OLD OPPOSITION LEADER WHO NOW LIVES IN EXILE IN EUROPE IS ONCE AGAIN WANTED BY THE RUSSIAN COURTS??AND THIS TIME KHODORKOVSKY IS ACCUSED OF MURDER. THE ONCE-POWERFUL OWNER OF THE YUKOS OIL COMPANY HAS ALREADY SPENT OVER 10 YEARS IN RUSSIAN PRISONS FOR ALLEGED FRAUD AND CLEARLY HAS NO INTENTION OF GOING BACK TO BE LOCKED UP AGAIN. BUT DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS THE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATIVE COMMITTEE ISSUED AN INTERNATIONAL WARRANT FOR HIS ARREST AND THE COURT IN MOSCOW ENDORSED IT. THE ALLEGED CRIME INVOLVES THE MURDER OF A MAYOR IN SIBERIA BACK IN 1998 AND GIVEN HOW LONG KHODORKOVSKY WAS IN PRISON WITHOUT THESE CHARGES BEING BROUGHT AGAINST HIM ONE MIGHT ASSUME THE REAL CRIME IN THE VIEW OF RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN WAS RATHER MORE RECENT. A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE DECISION KHODORKOVSKY SPOKE AT A PRESS CONFERENCE IN LONDON: ??A REVOLUTION IN RUSSIA IS INEVITABLE? THE FORMER OIL TYCOON SAID. MANY IN MOSCOW WERE SHALL WE SAY IRRITATED? AND NOT ONLY PUTIN??S PARTISANS. EVEN IF PEOPLE WOULD LIKE LESS OF A HEAVY HAND FROM THE KREMLIN AND MORE FREEDOM TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES THEY??RE HOPING FOR MODERNITY AND STABILITY NOT UPHEAVAL. IN THE WAKE OF KHODORKOVSKY??S REMARKS PRESSURE ON HIS SUPPORTERS INCREASED BOTH IN MOSCOW AND ST. PETERSBURG. SEVERAL DOZEN POLICEMEN SEARCHED FOR CRIMINAL EVIDENCE AROUND APARTMENTS OFFICES AND EVEN A PRIVATE VEHICLE THAT BELONGED TO EMPLOYEES OF OPEN RUSSIA A COMMUNITY OF ACTIVISTS SUPPORTED AND FINANCED BY KHODORKOVSKY. THE MOVEMENT??S WEBSITE OPENRUSSIA.ORG HAS POSTED INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS AND OPINION PIECES EXPOSING HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AND LARGE-SCALE CORRUPTION AMONG TOP OFFICIALS IN RUSSIA. WHY DID THE KREMLIN GO AFTER KHODORKOVSKY MORE THAN TWO YEARS AFTER PUTIN PARDONED HIM? IT??S NOT JUST THE PRESS CONFERENCE CERTAINLY. TO HEAR KHODORKOVSKY TELL THE STORY PUTIN??S AFRAID OF HIM. ??PUTIN SEES ME AS A THREAT ECONOMICALLY BECAUSE OF THE POSSIBLE SEIZURE OF RUSSIAN ASSETS ABROAD? KHODORKOVSKY TOLD THE PRESS. THE KREMLIN DENIED THAT PUTIN HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE NEW ARREST WARRANT. A DUMA DEPUTY DMITRY GUDKOV SUGGESTED JUST HOW BIG THE MONETARY QUESTION MIGHT BE: ??AUTHORITIES DO NOT WANT TO PAY OVER $50 BILLION COMPENSATION TO YUKOS.? IN 2014 A TRIBUNAL IN THE HAGUE RULED THE RUSSIAN STATE HAD FORCE BANKRUPTCY ON YUKOS THE BIGGEST PRIVATE OIL COMPANY IN THE COUNTRY IN ORDER TO APPROPRIATE ITS ASSETS AND PREVENT KHODORKOVSKY FROM ENTERING POLITICS. THE COURT IMPOSED $50 BILLION IN DAMAGES WHICH WAS ROUGHLY 2.5 PERCENT OF RUSSIA??S GDP AT A TIME IT WAS ALREADY IN RECESSION. SINCE THEN THE DUMA HAS BEEN WORKING TO CHANGE LEGISLATION TO HELP AVOID INTERNATIONAL COURT DECISIONS BUT BY PUTTING KHODORKOVSKY ON TRIAL FOR MURDER EVEN IN HIS ABSENTIA AUTHORITIES SHIFT THE FOCUS FROM THEM TO HIM. ??THEY ARE PREPARING THE WORLD FOR RUSSIA??S DECISION NOT TO PAY THE MONEY? GUDKOV TOLD THE DAILY BEAST IN A RECENT INTERVIEW. FOR KHODORKOVSKY THE EXILE??S LIFE IN FRANCE THE UK OR IN SWITZERLAND WAS NEVER THE SAME AS IN MOSCOW WHERE HE HAD A TEAM OF YOUNG ACTIVISTS WORKING FOR HIM. HIS FORMER PARTNER AND HEAD OF THE YUKOS-MOSCOW MANAGEMENT COMPANY ALEKSEI KONDAUROV TOLD THE DAILY BEAST THAT THIS THIRD TRIAL AGAINST KHODORKOVSKY IS MOSCOW??S REVENGE FOR SEVERAL BIG YUKOS VICTORIES IN INTERNATIONAL COURTS INCLUDING THE STRASBOURG COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS AS WELL AS THE HAGUE. ??THIS IS ALSO A REVENGE FOR KHODORKOVSKY AND HIS OPEN RUSSIA SUPPORTING OPPOSITION CANDIDATES AT ELECTIONS? KONDAUROV SAID. LAST WEEK KHODORKOVSKY TOLD BBC THAT HE WAS THINKING ABOUT ASKING THE UK FOR ASYLUM. MEANWHILE IN MOSCOW THE OLD PATTERNS FROM SOVIET DISSIDENT DAYS DECADES AGO ARE COMING BACK. FRIENDS IN THE OPEN RUSSIA COMMUNITY CALLED EACH OTHER ON THE PHONE WITH A QUESTION: ??DID THEY COME TO YOU?? ZOYA SVETOVA A JOURNALIST AND HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDER AT OPEN RUSSIA REMEMBERED THE ARRESTS OF HER DISSIDENT PARENTS IN THE 1980S: ??WHEN THE KGB CAME TO ARREST MY FATHER MY HUSBAND HELPED TO BURN SOME FAMILY PAPERS NOW MY COLLEAGUES DELETE DOCUMENTS FROM THEIR COMPUTERS. WE EXCHANGE A MEMO AN INSTRUCTION FOR WHAT TO DO WHEN THEY COME: DO NOT OPEN THE DOOR IMMEDIATELY CALL YOUR LAWYER? SVETOVA TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. MANY RUSSIANS LOOK ON KHODORKOVSKY FAVORABLY??AT LEAST 33 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION APPROVED OF HIS RELEASE FROM PRISON IN 2013. BUT SEEING WHAT PRESSURE THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT HAS SUFFERED NOT MANY HAVE BEEN WILLING TO JOIN. LAST YEAR ONLY 2 PERCENT OF RUSSIANS SAID THEY WOULD VOTE FOR KHODORKOVSKY IN THE NEXT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS. ??THE IDEA IS TO DISCREDIT HIM WITH THE MURDER TRIAL SO RUSSIAN POLITICIANS WOULD NOT TAKE HIS MONEY PEOPLE WOULD BE AFRAID OF WORKING WITH HIM? KONDAUROV TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. OF COURSE SUCH PRESSURE IS NOTHING NEW FOR THE FORMER TYCOON. VERA CHELYSHEVA THE AUTHOR OF PRISONER #1 A BOOK ABOUT KHODORKOVSKY HAS BEEN COVERING HIS TRIALS FOR MANY YEARS. ??I CANNOT SEE HOW THE UNBREAKABLE KHODORKOVSKY I KNOW COULD BE STOPPED BY MORE FALSIFIED ACCUSATIONS BY MORE PRESSURE AFTER WHAT HE HAS SUFFERED THROUGH? SAID CHELYSHEVA. ??HE IS A FREE SPIRIT HE WILL NOT STOP HIS STRUGGLE.? ,24361.0

WHILE THE INVESTIGATION DIDN??T MAKE IT INTO THE ENGLISH-LANGUAGE PRESS KOREAN MEDIA COVERED A MEETING IN HER DEFENSE LED BY CHRISTINE COLLIGAN KNOWN ALSO AS YOONHEE CHOI. ??A MOTHER WHO LIVES IN BAYSIDE WAS ACCUSED OF ABUSING HER 13-YEAR-OLD SON AND WAS ARRESTED? COLLIGAN ALLEGEDLY SAID AT A MAY MEETING. ??THE ASSOCIATION IS WORKING TO SHOW THAT SHE IS INNOCENT.? IN PARK??S VERSION OF EVENTS THE BOY INJURED HIS FACE AT A PLAYGROUND AND WAS SUBSEQUENTLY ASKED BY SCHOOL OFFICIALS WHAT HAPPENED. PARK CLAIMED SHE WAS PRESSURED TO CONFESS THAT THE BOY WAS BEING ABUSED AND CLAIMED THAT HER ??SON? WAS CONFUSED AND WASN??T ABLE TO ANSWER POLICE QUESTIONS CORRECTLY. THE KOREAN PARENTS?? ASSOCIATION CLAIMED TO HAVE A RECORDING OF THE BOY SAYING HE WAS TOO SCARED TO ANSWER QUESTIONS CORRECTLY AND A WITNESS FROM THE PLAYGROUND WHO SAW HIM HURT HIS FACE. THE KOREAN-LANGUAGE ARTICLE ABOUT THE MEETING ADDED THAT PARK WASN??T ALLOWED NEAR THE KIDS SO SHE WAS STAYING AT HER CHURCH AND IN HER CAR. COLLIGAN TOLD THE DAILY BEAST THAT SHE STILL BELIEVES PARK IS INNOCENT OF THE MAY CHARGES AND THAT SHE WORRIES THAT THE CURRENT ALLEGATIONS DON??T TAKE CULTURAL DIFFERENCES INTO ACCOUNT.

RECENTLY THE BOY NOW 14 HAD COMPLAINED TO MIDDLE SCHOOL OFFICIALS ABOUT THE ALLEGED ONGOING ABUSE. THEY NOTIFIED AUTHORITIES AT HIS SISTER??S HIGH SCHOOL AND OFFICIALS THERE SAID THEY ALSO SAW SIGNS OF PHYSICAL ABUSE ON THE GIRL. AMONG OTHER THINGS PROSECUTORS IN THE CASE ALLEGE THAT THE KIDS WERE FORCED TO WORK AT LOCAL GROCERY STORES AND HAND THEIR PAYCHECKS OVER TO PARK. THEY ALSO SAY THAT THE GIRL NOW 16 HAD TO GIVE PARK MANICURES AND MASSAGES AND THAT SHE ONCE MASSAGED PARK FOR FIVE HOURS WHILE THE WOMAN WATCHED TV. THE CHILDREN WERE ALLEGEDLY BROUGHT TO THE U.S. FROM KOREA IN 2010??AND PARK SUPPOSEDLY KEPT THEM FROM CONTACTING THEIR REAL PARENTS FOR YEARS AND EVEN TOOK AWAY THEIR PASSPORTS ACCORDING TO THE QUEENS DISTRICT ATTORNEY. ANOTHER EXTREME CLAIM BY PROSECUTORS IS THAT THE GIRL WAS FORCED TO SKIP SCHOOL FOR ALMOST A MONTH IN ORDER TO HELP PARK OUT AROUND THE HOUSE. WHEN SHE WAS AT SCHOOL TEACHERS REPORTED THAT THE GIRL LOOKED EXHAUSTED AND FREQUENTLY FELL ASLEEP??WHICH PROSECUTORS SAY MAY BE THE RESULT OF PARK ALLEGEDLY FORCING HER TO WORK AROUND THE HOUSE FOR 10 HOURS AFTER SCHOOL. LIGHTS WERE ON AT THE THREE-STORY FLUSHING HOME WHERE THE ABUSE ALLEGEDLY TOOK PLACE WHEN A DAILY BEAST REPORTER VISITED TUESDAY NIGHT BUT NO ONE ANSWERED THE DOOR. NEIGHBORS SAID THAT PARK HAD BEEN RELEASED ON BOND BUT WAS LYING LOW AND POINTED TO HER BLACK SEDAN PARKED DOWN THE STREET. NEIGHBORS SAY THEY WERE MOST SURPRISED TO FIND OUT THAT PARK WAS NOT THE BIOLOGICAL MOTHER OF THE CHILDREN. THOUGH THEY??D NOTICED THE KIDS DOING A LOT OF WORK AROUND THE HOUSE BUT MANY SAID THEY??D CHALKED IT UP TO CULTURAL DIFFERENCES. ??THE KIDS WERE WELL-BEHAVED? NEIGHBOR IFTHEMIA STATHAKIS SAID. ??I HOPE IT??S NOT TRUE.

FOR THOSE WELL-VERSED IN BOTH THE DISTANT AND RECENT PAST CLAIMS OF A POST-RACIAL ERA SMACK NOT ONLY OF NAIVETY BUT IGNORANCE. AS EVEN A CURSORY GLANCE AT ANY ONLINE COMMENT SECTION IS LIKELY TO REVEAL RACISM IS WIDESPREAD AND ITS PROPONENTS STILL WALK AMONG US.?Ÿ?Ÿ AMERICANS HAVE LONG UNDERESTIMATED THE NATION??S RACE PROBLEM ASSUMING THE TRANSITION FROM A NATION THAT FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS SANCTIONED SLAVERY AND WHITE SUPREMACY TO ONE THAT EMBRACES FULL RACIAL EQUALITY WOULD BE AN EASY ONE. IN FACT THE TRANSITION WILL CONTINUE TO BE DIFFICULT REQUIRING MUCH MORE THAN THE TIME THAT??S PASSED SINCE THE LANDMARK LEGISLATION OF THE MID-20TH CENTURY. NEVERTHELESS WE SHOULD NOT DESPAIR. FOR HISTORY SHOWS THAT AS LONG AS THERE HAS BEEN RACISM THERE HAS BEEN RESISTANCE TO THE IDEA. THOUGH ONLY RECENTLY ATTRACTING SCHOLARLY ATTENTION INTERRACIALISM??DEFINED BRIEFLY AS COMPANIONSHIP COLLABORATION AND COOPERATION ACROSS RACIAL LINES??IS AS MUCH A PART OF AMERICAN HISTORY AS IS RACIAL DIVISION AND STRIFE. EVEN WHEN AND WHERE YOU WOULD LEAST EXPECT TO FIND INTERRACIAL FRIENDSHIPS AND ALLIANCES THEY HAVE ALWAYS EXISTED. TAKE PENSACOLA FLORIDA DURING THE CIVIL WAR. IN TERMS OF POLITICS CULTURE AND GEOGRAPHY IT??S A CITY MORE DEEP SOUTH THAN SOUTH FLORIDA RESEMBLING MOBILE AND MONTGOMERY AS OPPOSED TO MIAMI. GIVEN THIS YOU MIGHT NOT EXPECT TO DISCOVER THE WIDESPREAD RESISTANCE TO SLAVERY AND WHITE SUPREMACY IN THE FAR-WEST FLORIDA PANHANDLE DURING THE HEYDAY OF SECESSIONISM AND THE RISE OF THE CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA. BUT THERE WAS. THOUGH LITTLE-KNOWN TODAY THE CIVIL WAR ALMOST STARTED IN PENSACOLA WHEN THE NEWLY ELECTED PRESIDENT ABRAHAM LINCOLN ORDERED MEN AND SUPPLIES TO REINFORCE?ŸFORT PICKENS A MASSIVE HEXAGONAL BRICK CITADEL ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF PENSACOLA BAY. LINCOLN WANTED TO PROVOKE CONFEDERATES INTO FIRING THE FIRST SHOTS OF THE WAR AT FORT PICKENS??BECAUSE OF ITS DEFENSIBILITY. THAT PLAN FAILED WHEN ARMY LEADERS IGNORED THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF??S ORDERS AND HANDED PENSACOLA AND THE ADJACENT NAVY YARD TO THE CONFEDERACY WITHOUT A FIGHT. DESPITE THE SETBACK UNION FORCES MANAGED TO HOLD FORT PICKENS FOR THE DURATION OF THE WAR. AS THE LARGEST FEDERALLY CONTROLLED FORTIFICATION IN THE DEEP SOUTH IT BECAME A BEACON OF FREEDOM ATTRACTING HUNDREDS OF FUGITIVE SLAVES. IT WAS IN THE WORDS OF ONE SOLDIER STATIONED THERE ??THE POINT TO WHICH THE NEGROES FLED AFTER THE OUTBREAK OF THE WAR FROM ALL SURROUNDING DISTRICTS AS IT WAS FOR SOME TIME THE ONLY POINT IN THE EXTREME SOUTH WHICH WAS HELD BY FEDERAL TROOPS AND WHERE THEY COULD BE SAFE.? A LOOK AT TWO SEPARATE INCIDENTS INVOLVING FUGITIVE SLAVES WHO TRIED TO REACH FORT PICKENS AND INSTEAD ENDED UP FACING A CONFEDERATE COURT-MARTIAL PROVES THE EXISTENCE OF INTERRACIALISM AT A TIME AND PLACE CONSIDERED ENTIRELY HOSTILE TO THE PRACTICE. THE FIRST INVOLVED FIVE ENSLAVED LABORERS CLAIMED BY JACKSON MORTON A FLORIDA STATE SENATOR AND ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL MEN IN REGION. THE MEN PETER WILLIAM ROBERT GEORGE AND STEPHEN CLAIMED THEY WERE WELL-TREATED BY MORTON BUT WHEN HE THREATENED TO MOVE THEM TO ALABAMA THEY STOLE SEVERAL BOATS DOCKED NEAR MORTON??S PLANTATION AND BEGAN THE DANGEROUS JOURNEY DOWN THE BLACKWATER RIVER TOWARD FORT PICKENS. WHEN THEY WERE ARRESTED BY CONFEDERATE SENTINELS SEVERAL DAYS LATER THE SLAVES TOOK FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ESCAPE ATTEMPT OPENLY AVOWING THEIR DESIRE TO BE FREE NEVERTHELESS THEY ADMITTED THAT SEVERAL WHITE MEN HELPED CONVINCE THEM TO ABSCOND. ACCORDING TO CONFEDERATE COURT RECORDS THE SOUTHERN RACE TRAITORS INCLUDED MAYO A WELL-KNOWN GROG-SHOP OWNER IN A SMALL INDUSTRIAL VILLAGE NORTH OF PENSACOLA CHANCE A CONTRACTOR WHO WORKED FOR MORTON NEAR MAYO??S SHOP AND GARRETT A LUMBER TRADER WHO PLIED THE NEARBY WATERS. FOR MORE THAN A YEAR EACH OF THESE FREE WHITE SOUTHERNERS RISKED THEIR LIVES AND LIVELIHOODS BY ENCOURAGING THEIR ENSLAVED BLACK ASSOCIATES TO RUN AWAY PROCLAIMING THAT BECAUSE OF LINCOLN??S ELECTION THEY WERE AS FREE AS WHITE MEN ??AND THAT THEY WERE FOOLS IF THEY DID NOT GO TO PICKENS AS IT WAS EASILY DONE.? IN THE SECOND INCIDENT A BONDSMAN FROM PENSACOLA NAMED EBENEZER MADE HIS WAY TO FORT PICKENS CARRYING NEWSPAPERS AND OTHER MATERIALS CONSIDERED ??USEFUL TO THE UNITED STATES TROOPS STATIONED THERE AND INJURIOUS TO THE SOUTHERN CONFEDERACY.? AFTER BEING APPREHENDED AND TAKEN ABOARD A CONFEDERATE STEAMSHIP THE ??INTELLIGENT BEING? LIKEWISE ADMITTED TO HAVING SEVERAL WHITE ACCOMPLICES. LOCKLY A MYSTERIOUS MAN WITH A REPUTATION FOR BEFRIENDING HIS BLACK NEIGHBORS PROVIDED THE BOAT ON WHICH EBENEZER TRIED TO ESCAPE AND EVEN SAILED WITH HIM PART OF THE WAY TO FORT PICKENS BEFORE BEING ??KNOCKED OVERBOARD BY THE BOOM.? MELMORE WAS ALSO NOTORIOUS IN PENSACOLA AS HE WAS ??THE HABITUAL ASSOCIATE OF NEGROES??AND PLACES HIMSELF UPON EQUALITY WITH THEM.? WHEN EBENEZER BEGAN PLOTTING HIS ESCAPE TO FORT PICKENS HE ASKED THE ??IRISHMAN? IF THERE WAS TRUTH TO EBENEZER??S OWNER??S CLAIM THAT THE ??YANKEES? AT FORT PICKENS TREATED FUGITIVE SLAVES SEVERELY. MELMORE TOLD EBENEZER THAT EVERYTHING HIS OWNER TOLD HIM ??WAS A DAMNED LIE??THAT IF HE WENT OVER TO THE YANKEES HE WOULD BE SO WELL TREATED THAT THEY WOULD GIVE HIM WORK AND PAY FOR IT AND SEND HIM TO NEW YORK OR LIBERIA.? IN THE END THE CONFEDERATE COURT-MARTIAL FOUND EACH OF THE RUNAWAYS GUILTY ON ALL CHARGES. BUT BEFORE OFFICIALS COULD CARRY OUT THE PUNISHMENTS WHICH RANGED FROM HUNDREDS OF LASHES TO DEATH BY HANGING CONFEDERATE TROOPS EVACUATED PENSACOLA RETURNING THE CITY AND SURROUNDING AREAS TO THE UNION. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF GARRETT WHOM THE COURT ACQUITTED OF UNKNOWN CHARGES THE FATE OF ??THE TRAITOROUS PEOPLE WITH WHITE SKINS? WHO ENCOURAGED AND ASSISTED THESE AND COUNTLESS OTHER RUNAWAYS TO FORT PICKENS IS UNKNOWN. STILL BEFORE LEAVING PENSACOLA A HIGH-RANKING CONFEDERATE COMMANDER WARNED ??THOSE MONSTERS AND VILE WRETCHES IN THE SHAPE OF WHITE MEN? OF THE DANGERS THEY FACED SHOULD THEY EVER BETRAY THEIR RACE AGAIN. FURTHER EVIDENCE OF INTERRACIALISM SURVIVING IN THE ANTEBELLUM AND CONFEDERATE SOUTH COMES FROM THE LAST TWO YEARS OF THE WAR WHEN UNION-OCCUPIED PENSACOLA SERVED AS A BASE FOR THOUSANDS OF BLACK AND WHITE SOLDIERS AND REFUGEES. AMONG THEM WERE JAMES SUMMERFORD AND WADE RICHARDSON TWO YOUNG WHITE ABOLITIONISTS WHO TRAVELED FROM CENTRAL ALABAMA TO ENLIST IN THE UNION ARMY. ACCORDING TO A MEMOIR WRITTEN YEARS AFTER THE WAR SUMMERFORD CAME FROM A FAMILY OF ??STRONG ABOLITIONISTS? WHILE RICHARDSON WAS THE SON OF A UNIVERSALIST PREACHER WHO ??EXTENDED HIS CREED TO INCLUDE ALL MEN BLACK AND WHITE GOOD AND BAD IN HIS SCHEME OF UNIVERSAL REDEMPTION.? RICHARDSON??S UNCLE ALSO AN ABOLITIONIST NEARLY LOST HIS LIFE TO AN ANGRY MOB NEAR TUSKEGEE ALABAMA FOLLOWING LINCOLN??S ELECTION WHEN HE REFUSED TO ENLIST IN A CONFEDERATE REGIMENT BECAUSE OF HIS OPPOSITION TO SLAVERY AND SECESSION. SUMMERFORD AND RICHARDSON NEARLY FAILED TO REACH PENSACOLA AS THE ENTIRE REGION WAS CONTROLLED BY CONFEDERATES YET THEY MANAGED TO AVOID DETECTION WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF BLACK SLAVES WHO READILY VOLUNTEERED INFORMATION ON THE MOVEMENT OF CONFEDERATE TROOPS ALONG ??WITH A BIT OF BREAD OR A ROASTED POTATO OR EAR OF CORN.? WHEN THE TWO FINALLY REACHED THEIR DESTINATION BOTH FELL VICTIM TO YELLOW FEVER. SUMMERFORD SUCCUMBED TO THE DISEASE WITHIN DAYS BUT RICHARDSON MANAGED TO SURVIVE THANKS TO THE SELFLESSNESS OF A ??COLORED NURSE.? ??THE WOMAN??S TREATMENT WAS HEROIC I ASSURE YOU? RICHARDSON RECALLED ??BUT THANKS TO HER I SURVIVED.? AFTER RECOVERING RICHARDSON ENLISTED IN THE FIRST FLORIDA CAVALRY A UNION REGIMENT CONSISTING ALMOST ENTIRELY OF WHITE SOUTHERNERS WHO SPENT MUCH OF THE REMAINDER OF THE WAR FREEING HUNDREDS OF SLAVES ALONG THE GULF COAST. CIVIL WAR PENSACOLA REMINDS US THAT HISTORY IS AN IMPORTANT TEACHER. WHILE LARGE NUMBERS OF AMERICAN CITIZENS HAVE FOUND WHITE SUPREMACY AN ATTRACTIVE IDEOLOGY WORTH FIGHTING AND EVEN KILLING FOR IT IS JUST AS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THE DREAM OF RACIAL EQUALITY HAS ALSO ALWAYS ATTRACTED A WIDE FOLLOWING??EVEN WHEN AND WHERE BELIEVING SUCH AN IDEA CAME AT GREAT COST. AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD AMID THE JARRING SOUNDS AND ARRESTING IMAGES OF RACIAL DISCORD IT WOULD BE WISE TO REMEMBER OUR PAST AND HAVE FAITH IN OUR FUTURE ANTICIPATING THE DAY WHEN OUR NATION WILL AGAIN BE TOUCHED AS LINCOLN PROMISED ??BY THE BETTER ANGELS OF OUR NATURE.? ,8442.0

BY LAW AMERICA'S ROUGHLY 130000 FEDERALLY LICENSED FIREARMS DEALERS ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT INFORMATION ON ALL PROSPECTIVE BUYERS THROUGH THE NATIONAL INSTANT CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK SYSTEM (NICS). THE SYSTEM WHICH IS ADMINISTERED BY THE FBI BLOCKS PROSPECTIVE GUN BUYERS WHO FALL INTO 12 CATEGORIES OF ??PROHIBITED PERSONS? THAT THE GOVERNMENT CONTENDS ARE MOST LIKELY TO COMMIT ACTS OF VIOLENCE. ANYONE WHO QUALIFIES FOUND TO BE IN POSSESSION OF A FIREARM IS GUILTY OF A FELONY. GUN CONTROL ADVOCATES HAVE CALLED EXPANDING THIS MANDATE TO INCLUDE SMALL PRIVATE SELLERS ??THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION MEASURE THAT THE GOVERNMENT COULD ADOPT.? IN PRINCIPLE THE IDEA OF A BARRIER PREVENTING DANGEROUS INDIVIDUALS FROM GETTING THEIR HANDS ON A FIREARM SOUNDS LIKE GOOD POLICY. IN PRACTICE HOWEVER NICS HAS OPERATED LARGELY AS A BLUNT-FORCE INSTRUMENT INFLUENCED BY DECADES OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE POLICIES THAT ARE STATISTICALLY PROVEN TO SINGLE MINORITIES FOR HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY. MORE THAN HALF OF THE ROUGHLY 1.3 MILLION PROSPECTIVE GUN BUYERS FLAGGED BY NICS SINCE IT WENT OPERATIONAL IN 1998 (OR NEARLY 700000 PEOPLE) WERE DISQUALIFIED FOR HAVING BEEN CONVICTED OF A CRIME PUNISHABLE BY MORE THAN ONE-YEAR IN PRISON. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE CRIMES ARE FELONIES. ANOTHER 110000 ARE BARRED FROM GUN OWNERSHIP BECAUSE THEY ARE USERS OF ILLICIT DRUGS. NO DOUBT SOME OF THESE PEOPLE PRESENT A THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY. SINCE THE FBI DOESN'T PUBLISH DATA ON THE CRIMINAL HISTORIES OF PROHIBITED PERSONS FLAGGED BY NICS HOWEVER JUST HOW MANY IS ANYONE'S GUESS. WHAT??S INDISPUTABLE IS THAT THE NUMBER OF AMERICANS WHO WOULD BE PROHIBITED FROM PURCHASING A FIREARM HAS GROWN CONSIDERABLY UNDER THE WAR ON DRUGS AND A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF THEM ARE AFRICAN-AMERICANS CHARGED WITH NON-VIOLENT OFFENSES.?Ÿ FOUR YEARS AFTER THE GUN CONTROL ACT OF 1968 (GCA) BANNED FELONS AND DRUG USERS FROM LEGALLY PURCHASING A FIREARM NEW YORK PASSED THE MOST DRACONIAN COLLECTION OF DRUG LAWS IN U.S. HISTORY.?Ÿ THE ROCKEFELLER DRUG LAWS BECAME A NATIONAL MODEL FOR A GROWING WAR ON DRUGS THAT CENTERED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON AMERICA'S MINORITY COMMUNITIES.?Ÿ EVEN A SINGLE DRUG ARREST CAN LEAD TO A LIFETIME PROHIBITION ON GUN OWNERSHIP. FOR EXAMPLE A FIRST-TIME CONVICTION FOR DISTRIBUTING ANY AMOUNT OF MARIJUANA OR MERELY POSSESSING HARDER DRUGS LIKE HEROIN CARRIES A MAXIMUM PENALTY OF MORE THAN FIVE YEARS IN PRISON IN SOME STATES. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN HAVE BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY PROSECUTED UNDER THE PATENTLY RACIST ??CRACK DISPARITY???WHICH UNTIL 2010 TREATED ONE GRAM OF COCAINE BASE AS THE EQUIVALENT OF 100 GRAMS OF POWDER.?Ÿ TODAY BLACK AMERICANS ARE FAR MORE LIKELY THAN WHITES TO BE ARRESTED PROSECUTED AND IMPRISONED FOR DRUG CRIMES. AND THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE THE BOOK THROWN AT THEM BY PROSECUTORS JURIES AND JUDGES.?Ÿ AS A RESULT AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE INCARCERATED AT SIX-TIMES THE RATE OF THEIR WHITE PEERS. IF WE CONTROL SIMPLY FOR DRUG OFFENSES THE DISPARITY BETWEEN BLACK AND WHITE IMPRISONMENT RATES RISES TO 10 TO 1.?Ÿ?Ÿ ACCORDING TO ONE REPORT A THIRD OF THE 24.5 MILLION PEOPLE ARRESTED FOR DRUG OFFENSES BETWEEN 1980 AND 2007 WERE AFRICAN AMERICANS (WHO COMPRISE JUST 13 PERCENT OF THE U.S. POPULATION). IN ONE CITY ALONE SAN FRANCISCO FELONY DRUGS ARREST RATES FOR BLACK ROSE BY 54 PERCENT DURING THE 1990S EVEN WHILE ARREST RATES FOR OTHER RACES FELL.?Ÿ DEPENDING ON STATE LAW NOT EVEN A FULL PARDON MAY BE ENOUGH TO RESTORE A FORMER OFFENDER'S GUN RIGHTS. THE REAL-WORLD CONSEQUENCES EVEN WITHOUT A TRIAL OF THIS DISPARITY CAN BE STUNNING. LAST YEAR IN FLORIDA??WHERE AFRICAN AMERICAN ADULTS ARE 35 PERCENT MORE LIKELY THAN WHITE ADULTS WITH A SIMILAR CRIME RECORD TO HAVE A FELONY RECORD??A 62-YEAR-OLD AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN WAS TACKLED TO THE GROUND BY TWO WHITE MEN IN A WALMART. HIS CRIME? LEGALLY CARRYING A HANDGUN. A RECENT PEW POLL FOUND A SHARP INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF AFRICAN AMERICANS WHO SAY THEY SUPPORT GUN RIGHTS. YET BLACKS ARE LESS THAN HALF AS LIKELY TO OWN A GUN THAN THEIR WHITE NEIGHBORS WITH FEWER THAN TWO-IN-TEN AFRICAN AMERICANS IDENTIFYING AS GUN OWNERS. THE SUPREME COURT AFFIRMED THE PROHIBITION ON FELONS AS ?? PRESUMPTIVELY LAWFUL? IN 2008 WITH DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA V. HELLER. SINCE THEN COURTS HAVE ETCHED OUT A PATHWAY FOR A CONVICTED FELON TO SUCCESSFULLY CHALLENGE THEIR STATUS AS A PROHIBITED PERSON UNDER THE GCA. BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL 2014 THAT SOMEONE ACTUALLY PULLED IT OFF. IN THAT CASE A FEDERAL COURT IN PHILADELPHIA RULED THAT A MAN WHO PLED GUILTY TO A SINGLE CHARGE OF CORRUPTING A MINOR IN 1998 (A FIRST CLASS MISDEMEANOR PUNISHABLE BY UP TO FIVE YEARS IN PRISON) COULD NOT LEGALLY BE DENIED A RIGHT TO PURCHASE A FIREARM. LAST YEAR ANOTHER FEDERAL COURT ALSO IN PENNSYLVANIA CAME TO A SIMILAR CONCLUSION IN THE CASE OF A PETITIONER WITH A 1990 CONVICTION FOR MISDEMEANOR POSSESSION OF AN UNREGISTERED HANDGUN. ??[T]HE INQUIRY IS WHETHER THE CHALLENGER TODAY NOT AT THE TIME OF ARREST IS MORE DANGEROUS THAN A TYPICAL LAW-ABIDING CITIZEN OR POSES A CONTINUING THREAT? WROTE THE JUSTICE WHO DECIDED THE CASE.?Ÿ BOTH MEN WERE REPRESENTED BY VIRGINIA ATTORNEY ALAN GURA WHO SUCCESSFULLY ARGUED THE HELLER CASE AND HAS EMERGED AS SOMETHING OF A ROCK STAR IN THE WORLD OF SECOND AMENDMENT LITIGATION.?Ÿ?Ÿ DESPITE THE EMERGING PRECEDENT GETTING SOMEONE TO GO ON RECORD SAYING THAT TOO MANY CONVICTED CRIMINALS ARE BEING DENIED THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO BUY A GUN IS NOT AN EASY TASK. RICK ECTOR THE OWNER OF RICK??S FIREARM ACADEMY IN DETROIT AND A STRONG VOICE IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN GUN COMMUNITY WAS COMFORTABLE CALLING A PROPOSAL TO EXTEND BACKGROUND CHECKS TO PEOPLE ON THE TSA'S NO FLY LIST A ??CONSPIRACY TO DISARM AMERICANS WITHOUT DUE PROCESS.? BUT WHEN ASKED HIS THOUGHTS ON THE RACIAL IMPLICATIONS OF A BLANKET BAN ON ALL CONVICTED FELONS HE WAS LESS COMMITTAL. ??THE GOVERNMENT HAS COME UP WITH ALL SORTS OF SCHEMES [TO DISENFRANCHISE GUN OWNERS] AND I THINK THE BLACK COMMUNITY HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY TARGETED? HE SAID. ??BUT WHAT YOU WILL STILL FIND IS THAT BY AND LARGE BLACK PEOPLE ONLY LIVE IN MAJOR URBAN AREAS AND MOST OF THESE PLACES HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF GUN CONTROL.? EVEN THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION BALKED AT GOING ON THE RECORD. CONTACTED FOR A COMMENT A SPOKESPERSON TOLD THE DAILY BEAST SHE WOULD ??CHECK INTO IT? BUT BY PRESS TIME HAD YET TO FOLLOW UP WITH A RESPONSE. IT'S DIFFICULT TO DEMONSTRATE EMPIRICALLY A CAUSAL LINK BETWEEN BACKGROUND CHECKS AND RATES OF BLACK GUN OWNERSHIP. (THE FORM THE GOVERNMENT USES TO ADMINISTER THE CHECKS INCLUDES A QUESTION ABOUT AN APPLICANT'S RACE BUT IT DOESN'T PUBLISH THE DATA). STILL THE MERE EXISTENCE OF PUBLIC POLICY THAT IMPACTS CITIZENS UNEQUALLY BASED ON RACE IS WORTH MORE STUDY. UNDER U.S. LAW AN EMPLOYER CAN BE HELD IN VIOLATION OF THE CIVIL RIGHT ACT OF 1964 FOR HIRING POLICIES THAT HAVE AN ??ADVERSE IMPACT? ON A PROTECTED CLASS EVEN UNINTENTIONALLY. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS REPEATEDLY GONE ON RECORD SINCE 2008 ARGUING THAT BACKGROUND CHECKS WHEN BROADLY APPLIED TO HIRING AMOUNT TO RACIAL DISCRIMINATION. MEANWHILE LAWMAKERS FROM BOTH POLITICAL PARTIES HAVE GONE TO GREAT LENGTHS IN AN ATTEMPT TO CORRECT RACIAL DISPARITIES PERPETUATED BY LAWS THAT BAR EX-FELONS FROM VOTING. NICHOLAS JOHNSON A FORDHAM LAW PROFESSOR AND SECOND AMENDMENT SCHOLAR ACKNOWLEDGED THE POTENTIAL FOR PRECISELY THIS KIND OF RACIAL INEQUITY IN THE APPLICATION OF FEDERAL BACKGROUND CHECKS. ??THESE ARE VERY OLD CATEGORIES AND THEY DIDN'T GET THE SAME LEVEL OF SCRUTINY DECADES AGO. SO YOU HAVE ALL THESE CATEGORIES AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE MEANS-END QUESTION IT'S NOT CLEAR ARE THESE THINGS GOING TO MEET A STANDARD OF ??LEAST RESTRICTIVE??? HE SAID.?Ÿ BUT JOHNSON WHO AUTHORED THE 2014 BOOK \NEGROES AND THE GUN: THE BLACK TRADITION OF ARMS? SAYS THE ISSUE IS PROBABLY NOT HIGH ON THE LIST OF PRIORITIES FOR MOST AMERICANS.?Ÿ ??IF YOU ASK PEOPLE ON THE STREET I??M NOT SURE IF THIS IS WHAT THEY WANT TO FIGHT IN TERM OF A RIGHTS CLAIM? HE SAID ADDING THAT MORE ACUTE RACIAL BIAS IS EVIDENT IN THE PERMITTING PROCESS IN SO-CALLED ??MAY ISSUE? STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA AND NEW YORK WHERE BLACKS FACE HIGHER BURDENS THAN WHITES FOR CONCEALED CARRY LICENSES.?Ÿ TO DATE THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF THE ISSUE IS PROBABLY A 2009 ARTICLE TITLED ??WHY CAN??T MARTHA STEWART OWN A GUN? WHICH WAS PUBLISHED PUBLISHED IN THE HARVARD JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY. THE AUTHOR??ATTORNEY C. KEVIN MARSHALL??EXPLORES THE HISTORICAL PRECEDENT OF A U.S. POLICY THAT CONSIDERS A TELEVISION PERSONALITY CONVICTED ON CHARGES RELATED TO INSIDER TRADING TOO MUCH IF A PUBLIC THREAT TO OWN A FIREARM. ??IS THE PUBLIC SAFER NOW THAT MARTHA STEWART IS COMPLETELY AND PERMANENTLY DISARMED??Ÿ MORE TO THE POINT HOW COULD SUCH A BAN BE CONSTITUTIONAL?? MARSHALL ASKS. HE CONCLUDES THAT WHEREVER THE CONSTITUTIONAL LINE MAY BE ??IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THE COMPLETE LIFETIME BAN FOR ALL FELONS THAT FEDERAL LAW HAS IMPOSED ONLY SINCE 1968.??Ÿ?Ÿ SECOND-AMENDMENT DISENFRANCHISEMENT IS JUST ONE AREA WHERE DRUG POLICY AND GUN POLICY ARE LIKELY TO COLLIDE AS EFFORTS TO MOVE AWAY FROM ZERO-TOLERANCE PROHIBITION EVOLVE. LAST WEEK NEW YORK BECAME THE 23RD STATE TO LEGALIZE MEDICAL MARIJUANA. FOUR STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HAVE LEGALIZED POT FOR RECREATIONAL USE AND ANOTHER TEN ARE EXPECTED TO CONSIDER SIMILAR MEASURES THIS YEAR. SINCE THE GUN CONTROL ACT ALSO PROHIBITS ??USERS OF ILLICIT SUBSTANCES? FROM LEGALLY ACQUIRING A FIREARM THERE ARE NOW LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS IN ROUGHLY HALF OF ALL AMERICAN STATES WHO CAN BE DENIED A RIGHT TO OWN A GUN UNDER FEDERAL STATUTE. IN SINCE 2012 WHEN COLORADO LEGALIZED MARIJUANA FOR RECREATIONAL USE GUN RIGHTS ADVOCATES HAVE QUIETLY FOUGHT TO RECTIFY THE DISCONNECT. ??WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS RAISE PEOPLE'S AWARENESS? SAID ISAAC CHASE A CO-FOUNDER OF THE GROUP CAMPAIGN FOR EQUAL GUN RIGHTS WHICH UNSUCCESSFULLY FOUGHT FOR A BALLOT MEASURE IN 2014 CORRECTING INCONSISTENCIES IN COLORADO'S CONCEALED CARRY LAW. ??WE HAVE A LOT OF VETERANS IN THIS STATE A LOT OF VETERANS WHO USE MARIJUANA ILLEGALLY. THEY WENT OVERSEAS AND FOUGHT FOR FREEDOM AND NOW THEY'RE BEING TOLD THEY CAN'T PROTECT THEMSELVES.? BUT NOT EVERYONE IS ON BOARD. TONY FABIAN PRESIDENT OF THE COLORADO STATE SHOOTING ASSOCIATION AN NRA AFFILIATED GROUP SAID HIS MEMBERS WOULD OPPOSE LETTING POT USERS CARRY GUNS. ??FEDERAL LAW PROHIBITS THE POSSESSION AND USE OF MARIJUANA AND ITS DERIVATIVES AND THEREFORE ITS POSSESSION AND USE IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH LEGAL RESPONSIBLE FIREARMS OWNERSHIP? HE SAID IN A DECEMBER 2014 INTERVIEW. MEANWHILE LEGAL PRECEDENT IS STILL EVOLVING ON THE ISSUE. IN 2012 THE U.S. SUPREME COURT REFUSED TO HEAR AN APPEAL BY AN OREGON SHERIFF OF A RULING BY THE STATE'S SUPREME COURT THAT UPHELD THE RIGHT OF MEDICAL POT USERS TO CARRY A CONCEALED WEAPON. BUT A CASE ARGUED LAST YEAR BY THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR 4TH CIRCUIT UPHELD THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S AUTHORITY TO CHARGE A WEST VIRGINIA POT USER AS A PROHIBITED FIREARMS OWNER UNDER THE GUN CONTROL ACT. WHILE THE COURT REQUIRED THE GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE SOME EVIDENCE THAT ITS ACTION WAS JUSTIFIED IT FOUND THAT A MERE CORRELATION BETWEEN DRUGS AND CRIME??AND NOT NECESSARILY A CAUSAL LINK??WAS SUFFICIENT. THAT ISN'T ENOUGH TO DETER CHASE THOUGH WHO SAYS HE ISN'T READY TO GIVE UP THE FIGHT FOR EQUAL GUN RIGHTS FOR POT-SMOKING COLORADANS. ??I WANT TO MOVE THE ISSUE FORWARD? HE SAID. ??IF YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO USE MARIJUANA AND A RIGHT TO CARRY A GUN BUT THE LAWS DON'T MATCH UP THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THAT.??Ÿ """,37523.0

1156,10277079.0,2016-01-25T23:50:00+00:00,WHY BANKSY??S ART IS SUCH A DEADLY POLITICAL WEAPON,IN A 2007 INTERVIEW WITH THE NEW YORKER BANKSY THE SUBVERSIVE BRITISH GRAFFITI ARTIST WAS ASKED WHAT DREW HIM TO HIS WORK. ??I USED TO WANT TO SAVE THE WORLD? HE RESPONDED DRILY ??BUT NOW I??M NOT SURE I LIKE IT ENOUGH.? THE PARADOX OF THAT SENTIMENT HAS BEEN A CONSTANT IN HIS STENCILLED PAINTINGS A PORTFOLIO OF FACILE ONE-LINERS MANIFESTED IN TEXT AND IMAGES. BANKSY??S MOST RECENT CREATION POPPED UP OVER THE WEEKEND IN LONDON ON A WALL OPPOSITE THE FRENCH EMBASSY: A MURAL RE-IMAGINING AN ICONIC IMAGE OF COLETTE FROM THE MUSICAL LES MIS??RABLES CRYING AS A CLOUD OF TEAR GAS ENVELOPS HER. THE ARRESTING WORK IS A POINTED CRITIQUE OF THE ALLEGED USE OF TEAR GAS BY FRENCH POLICE IN THE SLUM-LIKE ??JUNGLE? CALAIS REFUGEE CAMP WHERE ROUGHLY 5000 MIGRANTS FROM COUNTRIES LIKE SYRIA LIBYA AND ERITREA ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE SETTLED. LAST WEEK WITH ASSISTANCE FROM AID GROUPS LIKE HELPREFUGEES AND CARE4CALAIS FRENCH AUTHORITIES EVICTED 1500 FROM THE OVERFLOWING SHANTYTOWN MOVING THEM INTO CHURCHES AND OTHER FACILITIES. FRENCH POLICE HAVE DENIED USING TEAR GAS BUT A VIDEO THAT SURFACED AFTER THE EVICTION SHOWS THEM DOING JUST THAT DURING A PREVIOUS RAID OF THE REFUGEE CAMPS. THE VIDEO CAN BE ACCESSED BY ANYONE WHO PASSES BANKSY??S COLETTE: BENEATH HER IS A STENCILLED QR BARCODE WHICH LINKS TO THE FOOTAGE WHEN VIEWERS SCAN IT WITH THEIR SMART PHONES. (BANKSY HAS CONFIRMED THAT THE WORK IS INDEED HIS POSTING AN IMAGE OF THE MURAL ON HIS WEBSITE. HIS REPRESENTATIVES DID NOT RETURN REQUESTS FOR FURTHER COMMENT.) THE COLETTE MURAL IS THE ARTIST??S FIRST INTERACTIVE WORK??A CLEVER MOVE BY BANKSY THAT UNDERSCORES HOW GENUINELY RESPONSIVE AND IN-THE-MOMENT HIS WORK IS. IT??S ALSO HIS LATEST IN A SERIES OF COMMENTARIES ON EUROPE??S MIGRANT CRISIS MANY OF WHICH APPEARED IN AND AROUND THE CALAIS REFUGEE CAMP LAST DECEMBER. ONE WAS AN IMAGE OF STEVE JOBS THE LATE APPLE CO-FOUNDER CLUTCHING A DATED MACINTOSH COMPUTER IN ONE HAND AND A TRASH BAG SLUNG OVER HIS SHOULDER??A REFERENCE TO JOBS?? FATHER WHO IMMIGRATED TO THE U.S. FROM SYRIA AFTER WORLD WAR II. BANKSY WHO RARELY COMMENTS ON HIS WORKS RELEASED A STATEMENT ABOUT THE JOBS MURAL TO THE NEW YORK TIMES VIA A SPOKESPERSON. ??WE??RE OFTEN LED TO BELIEVE MIGRATION IS A DRAIN ON THE COUNTRY??S RESOURCES BUT STEVE JOBS WAS THE SON OF A SYRIAN MIGRANT? HE SAID. ??APPLE IS THE WORLD??S MOST PROFITABLE COMPANY IT PAYS OVER $7 BILLION A YEAR IN TAXES??AND IT ONLY EXISTS BECAUSE THEY ALLOWED IN A YOUNG MAN FROM HOMS.? OTHER OF BANKSY??S WORKS IN CALAIS INCLUDED A RE-IMAGINING OF TH??ODORE G??RICAULT??S ??THE RAFT OF MEDUSA?? THE INFAMOUS 19TH CENTURY PAINTING OF SHIPWRECK SURVIVORS WHO CRASHED WHILE TRYING TO COLONIZE SENEGAL. G??RICAULT DREW METICULOUSLY FROM THE ACCOUNTS OF TWO SURVIVORS WHEN PAINTING HIS MASTERPIECE. IN BANKSY??S VERSION THE SURVIVORS WAVE FRANTICALLY AS A YACHT FIT FOR JAY-Z DARTS ACROSS THE HORIZON. BANKSY ALSO MADE POLITICAL WAVES LAST SUMMER WITH HIS TEMPORARY DISMALAND ??BEMUSEMENT PARK? IN WESTON-SUPER-MARE THE DILAPIDATED ENGLISH SEASIDE RESORT WHERE HE CONSTRUCTED AN INSTALLATION OF BOATS PACKED WITH REFUGEES. BANKSY??S ART HAS LONG BEEN RIFE WITH POLITICAL OVERTONES LIKE HIS 2005 TROMPE L??OEIL STENCILS OF HOLES ON THE PALESTINIAN SIDE OF ISRAEL??S WEST BANK WALL. (IN A STATEMENT THE ELUSIVE GRAFFITI ARTIST SAID THAT THE WALL ??IS ILLEGAL UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW AND ESSENTIALLY TURNS PALESTINE INTO THE WORLD??S LARGEST OPEN PRISON.?) HE RETURNED TO THE REGION LAST SPRING PAINTING MURALS ON BUILDINGS AND RUINS IN GAZA. BANKSY ONCE TOLD HIS FRIEND THE AUTHOR TRISTAN MANCO THAT HE LIKES ??THE POLITICAL EDGE? OF HIS WORK. ??ALL GRAFFITI IS LOW-LEVEL DISSENT BUT STENCILS HAVE AN EXTRA HISTORY? HE SAID. ??THEY??VE BEEN USED TO START REVOLUTIONS AND TO STOP WARS.? INDEED BANKSY SEEMS TO BE MOUNTING HIS OWN REVOLUTION AGAINST THE OFFICIALS IN EUROPE WHO HAVE SANCTIONED REFUGEES FROM CROSSING THEIR BORDERS. POLITICS AND ACTIVISM ARE FREQUENTLY REFERENCED BY ARTISTS BOTH LITTLE-KNOWN AND FAMOUS BUT THE IMMEDIACY AND ACCESSIBILITY OF BANKSY??S POLITICALLY-INSPIRED WORK MAKES IT ESPECIALLY POTENT. ??ALL ART IS POLITICAL IN SOME WAY BUT BANKSY ALWAYS HAS THAT QUICK RESPONSE? RACHEL CAMPBELL JOHNSTON THE LONDON TIMES?? ART CRITIC TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. ??IT??S PROMINENT BECAUSE IT??S IN THE MOMENT AND VISIBLE TO THE PUBLIC. HE USES ART AS A WEAPON. I THINK MANY ARTISTS USE POLITICS IN ORDER TO GET INTO GALLERIES WHEREAS BANKSY DOES THE OPPOSITE.? WAR HAS ALWAYS BEEN A MAINSTAY FOR ARTISTS. JOHNSTON CITED BRITISH ARTIST MARK WALLINGER AS AN ARTIST WHO LIKE BANKSY HAS RESPONDED CLEVERLY AND IMMEDIATELY TO TOUCHSTONES IN POLITICAL DEBATES. AFTER BRIAN HAW??S IRAQ WAR PROTEST IN BRITAIN??S PARLIAMENT SQUARE WAS CONFISCATED IN 2005 UNDER A LAW THAT SAID PROTESTS ARE FORBIDDEN IN A SPECIFIED AREA AROUND PARLIAMENT WALLINGER RECREATED THE CAMP IN A 2007 EXHIBIT AT THE TATE MODERN??TECHNICALLY STILL WITHIN THE ??EXCLUSION AREA? SURROUNDING PARLIAMENT. JOHNSTON ALSO CITED ??FUCK THE HEIR FOR PUPPY BEAR? A PORNOGRAPHIC PERFORMANCE BY VOINA THE RUSSIAN ART COLLECTIVE IN RESPONSE TO DMITRY MEDVEDEV??S 2008 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION (HE SERVED UNTIL 2012). ??EVERYONE THOUGHT MEDVEDEV WAS A PUPPET FOR PUTIN SO THEY ALL STRIPPED NAKED AND FUCKED EACH OTHER UP THE ASS? JOHNSTON SAID OF THE SHOW WHICH WAS STAGED IN FEBRUARY 2008 AT THE MOSCOW BIOLOGICAL MUSEUM. WHILE SOME ART CRITICS THINK BANKSY??S ART IS TOO OBVIOUS OTHERS THINK HIS ON-THE-NOSE POLITICAL ONE-LINERS ARE GENIUS. ??IT??S VERY SHARP AS A POLITICAL CARTOONIST??S JOKE WITH A LEANING-AGAINST-THE-BAR PUNCHLINE THAT APPEALS PARTICULARLY TO THE ENGLISH SENSE OF HUMOR? SAID JOHNSTON. THE POLITICAL ACTIVISM IN HIS WORK RESONATES EVEN MORE WITH THE AVERAGE VIEWER BECAUSE HE??S AN ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT ARTIST. EVEN AS HIS ARTWORK FETCHES HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AT AUCTION BANKSY GIVES IT AWAY FOR FREE. HE ISN??T REPRESENTED BY GALLERIES AND AS A RESULT HE??S ENTIRELY IN CONTROL OF HIS OWN NARRATIVE. ,16494.0

HERE??S A TYPICAL STORY THAT??S LIKELY TO CROP UP. DAWKINS??S INABILITY TO KEEP SILENT ON SOCIAL MEDIA IS WHY THESE LAME ARTICLES CONSTANTLY KEEP REAPPEARING. STILL THE ONLINE RETALIATION THAT FOLLOWS IS OFTEN WORSE. SCROLLING DOWN THROUGH MY TWITTER FEED AFTER READING THE AFOREMENTIONED ARTICLE I NOTICED DAWKINS MANIA WAS TRENDING YET AGAIN. GANGS OF HOLIER-THAN-THOU-LIBERALS WERE QUEUING UP TO FURIOUSLY OUT-TWEET EACH OTHER ATTEMPTING TO SHOW WHO WAS MORE MORALLY OUTRAGED. ??DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT? DEMANDED GRAHAM LINEHAN A COMEDY TELEVISION WRITER WITH MORE THAN HALF A MILLION FOLLOWERS. ON TWITTER??WHERE HE HAS AN ASTOUNDING 1.3 MILLION FOLLOWERS HIMSELF?? DAWKINS IS TO PUT IT MILDLY A BIT OF A SENSATIONALIST. HIS FAVORITE ONLINE HOBBY IS TO ASK QUESTIONS AND CONDUCT THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS THAT ARE A CONSTANT WORK IN PROGRESS. THIS MAY BE AN INTRIGUING IDEA IF YOU ARE IN A SMALL OXFORD SCIENCE TUTORIAL WITH POLITE LIKE-MINDED STUDENTS. BUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA WHERE ANGER AND MORAL SUPERIORITY RELENTLESSLY EXPLODE INTO FIREBALLS OF POISON AND HATRED ALMOST EVERY SECOND CONDUCTING SUCH CONVERSATIONS IS A RECIPE FOR DISASTER. DAWKINS SEEMS TO RELISH THE ROLE OF BAD-BOY CONTRARIAN THOUGH. AND THE QUESTIONS HE TENDS TO ASK WHILE USUALLY WELL INTENDED DON??T HAVE THE DIRECT YES OR NO ANSWERS HE??S ACCUSTOMED TO WORKING WITH. IN THE SCIENCE WORLD THE METHOD FOR COMING UP WITH A CREDIBLE HYPOTHESIS WORKS AS FOLLOWS: CONDUCT AN EXPERIMENT DISPLAY YOUR EVIDENCE??BACKED UP WITH DATA??AND THEN DRAW A CONCLUSION AS TO WHETHER SOMETHING IS TRUE OR FALSE. IT??S A LIBERATING IDEA THAT HAS MARCHED HUMANITY TOWARDS PROGRESSIVE SECULAR VALUES FREE FROM NONSENSICAL SUPERSTITION. BUT THOSE SAME SO-CALLED ENLIGHTENMENT VALUES LEST WE FORGET ALSO BROUGHT US THE ATOMIC BOMB AND EUGENICS HARDLY GREAT EXAMPLES OF DIGNIFIED HUMAN PROGRESS. VIA TWITTER AND THE DAILY ONLINE NEWS AGENDA DAWKINS REGULARLY PUTS HIMSELF FORWARD AS A GLOBAL COMMENTATOR FOR WESTERN CIVILIZATION. THE TROUBLE IS HOWEVER NEWS STORIES COVERING COMPLEX SUBJECTS SUCH AS WAR PERSECUTION FAMINE PEDOPHILIA REFUGEES GENOCIDE ECONOMICS GENITAL MUTILATION AND MURDER ALL REQUIRE CONSIDERABLE NUANCE SOMETHING THE BRITISH SCIENTIST DISTINCTLY LACKS.

UNFORTUNATELY DAWKINS??S NAME IS NOW BECOMING MORE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH THESE TRIVIAL ONLINE ROWS??WHICH TEND TO GET BOGGED DOWN IN SEMANTICS POLITICAL CORRECTNESS AND MORAL OUTRAGE??THAN ANYTHING OF REAL INTELLECTUAL SUBSTANCE. THAT??S A SHAME CONSIDERING HIS ENORMOUS CONTRIBUTION TO EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY OVER THE LAST FOUR DECADES.

WHEN POINT SCORING DOES OCCUR IT??S NORMALLY WITH OTHER SCIENTISTS SUCH AS THE LATE STEPHEN JAY GOULD WITH WHOM DAWKINS DISAGREED ABOUT MANY MATTERS IN THEIR SHARED FIELD OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY. BUT EVEN WHEN THE GLOVES COME OFF IN THIS ARENA DAWKINS MAINTAINS HIS MOST GRACIOUS AND DIGNIFIED ROLE: THE GREAT COMMUNICATOR TO A POPULAR SCIENCE AUDIENCE. IN AN APPETITE FOR WONDER PUBLISHED TWO YEARS AGO DAWKINS DESCRIBED GROWING UP PRIVILEGED AND PAMPERED IN KENYA AS THE CHILD OF A COLONIAL SERVICEMAN WORKING FOR THE BRITISH EMPIRE THEN RETURNING TO ATTEND PUBLIC SCHOOL IN POST-WAR BRITAIN WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY ALLOWED HIM TO ENTER INTO THE ZOOLOGY DEPARTMENT AS AN UNDERGRADUATE IN OXFORD IN 1959 AN INSTITUTION IN WHICH HE REMAINED FOR MOST OF HIS LIFE. BRIEF CANDLE IN THE DARK AND AN APPETITE FOR WONDER ARE EXTREMELY SIMILAR IN TONE AND BOTH ARE A LITTLE SNOOZY WHEN IT COMES TO THE STRICTLY AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL PARTS. THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL EVENTS WE ENCOUNTER HERE ARE DINNER PARTIES WHERE DISAGREEMENTS WITH FELLOW ACADEMICS OVER SAYING GRACE IN LATIN END WITH A POLITE HANDSHAKE OR JOKE RATHER THAN A PUNCH UP. SKINNY DIPPING AT AN ACADEMIC CONFERENCE??AFTER ONE BEER TOO MANY??APPEARS TO BE THE MOST REBELLIOUS ACT DAWKINS HAS EVER COMMITTED IN HIS LIFE. IRONICALLY GIVEN HOW ABRUPT HIS ONLINE PERSONA CAN BE AT TIMES DAWKINS SEEMS TO HAVE A PENCHANT FOR GOOD OLD FASHIONED BRITISH POLITENESS. HE SPENDS MUCH OF THE NARRATIVE SELF CONSCIOUSLY APOLOGIZING TO THE READER IN ADVANCE FOR FEAR HE MAY SOMEHOW OFFEND. FOLLOWING MY PUBLIC INTERVIEW WITH DAWKINS LAST OCTOBER MANY MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE REMARKED TO ME HOW SURPRISED THEY WERE AT THE GENIAL COURTEOUS SWEET POLITE AND EXTREMELY INTELLIGENT ELDER STATESMAN-LIKE FIGURE THEY ENCOUNTERED ON STAGE. THAT SAID IT??S WHEN HE RELEASES HIMSELF FROM THE SHACKLES OF POLITE CONVERSATION THAT DAWKINS KNUCKLES DOWN TO WHAT HE??S BEST AT: SCIENCE. AS SOON AS THAT HAPPENS IN BRIEF CANDLE THE NARRATIVE SHIFTS FROM FIRST TO FIFTH GEAR ALMOST INSTANTANEOUSLY. IN THE OPENING CHAPTER DAWKINS ASKS IF WE ARE WITNESSING A CONSTRUCTIVE MERGER BETWEEN SCIENTIFIC AND LITERARY CULTURES WHICH HE REFERS TO AS THE ??THIRD CULTURE? THAT IS BOOKS BY PROFESSIONAL SCIENTISTS WRITTEN IN A LANGUAGE THAT APPEAL TO THE GENERAL READING PUBLIC. HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN DESCRIBING HIMSELF. IN?ŸTHE SELFISH GENE HIS 1976 DEBUT HE DEPLOYS A STYLE THAT IS PART HIGH LITERARY AND PART SCI FI TO SEAMLESSLY AND LUCIDLY BLEND SCIENCE AND ALLEGORY. DAWKINS WAS INSPIRED TO WRITE THE BOOK BECAUSE THERE WAS SUCH A WIDELY HELD MISUNDERSTANDING OF DARWINISM AT THE TIME. AND IN BOTH BRIEF CANDLE IN THE DARK AND AN APPETITE FOR WONDER HE CONTINUALLY RETURNS TO HIS MAGNUM OPUS AS A POINT OF REFERENCE. ONE OF THE MOST PERSISTENT??AND ANNOYING??CRITICISMS OF THE SELFISH GENE CLAIMS DAWKINS IS THAT IT MISTAKES THE LEVEL AT WHICH NATURAL SELECTION (DEFINED AS THE NON RANDOM DIFFERENTIAL REPRODUCTION OF GENES) ACTS. AS THE LATE JOHN MAYNARD SMITH??A GREAT CHAMPION OF DAWKINS??S WORK??ONCE COMMENTED: ??THE SELFISH GENE REPORTS NO NEW FACTS. [WHAT] IT DOES OFFER IS A NEW WORLD VIEW.? TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS THE NEW WORLD VIEW DRAMATICALLY ALTERED THE CULTURE OF MAINSTREAM SCIENCE IN THE MID ??70S ONE NEEDS TO COMPREHEND EXACTLY WHAT WAS BEING DISCUSSED AMONG EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGISTS AT THE TIME. THE MAIN DEBATE CONCERNED TWO TOPICS: GROUP SELECTION AND KIN SELECTION. THE GROUP SELECTION DEBATE WAS EXACERBATED BY V.C. WYNNE-EDWARD??S BOOK ANIMAL DISPERSION IN RELATION TO SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR WHICH ARGUED THAT BEHAVIOR ADAPTATIONS HAD EVOLVED BY GROUP SELECTION: THE SURVIVAL OF SOME GROUPS AND THE EXTINCTION OF OTHERS. MANY BIOLOGISTS WERE EXTREMELY SKEPTICAL ABOUT WYNNE-EDWARDS??S THESIS AND ARGUED THAT NATURAL SELECTION TYPICALLY ACTS BY FAVORING SOME INDIVIDUALS BUT NOT SOME POPULATIONS. DURING THIS PERIOD ENGLISH BIOLOGIST W.D. HAMILTON PROPOSED ANOTHER THEORY ABOUT HOW NATURAL SELECTION ACTS. HAMILTON??S THESIS??NOW MORE COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS KIN SELECTION??FOLLOWS THE NEO-DARWINIAN SYNTHESIS WHICH CENTERS ON THE GENE AS THE UNIT OF NATURAL SELECTION. GENES HAMILTON POSTULATED ARE WHAT ENCOURAGE SOCIAL ALTRUISM AND COOPERATION BETWEEN RELATED SPECIES. REPEAT THAT LAST SENTENCE OUT LOUD JUST FOR ONE MOMENT: IT??S ONE OF THE MOST LIBERATING EMPOWERING AND POSITIVE FORCES ON THE PLANET. AND IT??S WHY I CONSIDER THE SELFISH GENE??WHICH REINFORCES THAT IDEA WITH STRIKING CLARITY??TO BE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ. DAWKINS WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THE DEBT WE OWE TO HAMILTON CLAIMED THAT HAMILTON WOULD HAVE BEEN WISER TO ADOPT A FULL BLOODED ??GENE??S EYE? VIEW OF EVOLUTION. AND IN THE SELFISH GENE DAWKINS ALSO URGES US TO RECOGNIZE THE FUNDAMENTAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN REPLICATORS THAT IS ENTITIES WHOSE PRECISE STRUCTURE IS REPLICATED IN THE PROCESS OF REPRODUCTION AND VEHICLES ENTITIES WHICH ARE MORTAL AND WHICH ARE NOT REPLICATED BUT WHOSE PROPERTIES ARE INFLUENCED BY REPLICATORS. OR AS DAWKINS ELOQUENTLY PUTS IT HIMSELF IN BRIEF CANDLE IN THE DARK: ??GENES SURVIVE BY PULLING PHENOTYPIC LEVERS OF POWER. BUT WHY ARE THOSE PHENOTYPIC LEVERS BUNDLED INTO DISCRETE VEHICLES WHICH WE CALL ORGANISMS AND WHY DO THE IMMORTAL REPLICATORS ??CHOOSE? TO GANG UP WITH OTHER GENES TO SHARE VEHICLES. THIS WAS THE POINT AT WHICH I WENT BEYOND HAMILTON WHILE NEVER REALLY GOING AGAINST ANYTHING HE SAID.? WHEN DAWKINS IS WRITING WITH THIS ABSOLUTE CLARITY OF TONE??WHERE THERE IS NO ROOM FOR NUANCE WHATSOEVER??HE TRULY IS AN EXTRAORDINARY THINKER OF EXCEPTIONAL PROPORTIONS: IN THE WORLD OF SCIENCE THAT IS. EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY LIKE ALL SCIENCE REQUIRES MATHEMATICAL FORMULAS AND PRECISION OF LOGIC TO MAKE PERFECT SENSE. SOMETHING EITHER IS OR IT IS NOT. THERE IS NO GREY AREA OR ROOM FOR REBUTTAL AND DEBATE. UNLESS OF COURSE NEW EVIDENCE EMERGES. BUT WHERE DAWKINS HAS FOUND CRITICISM IN RECENT YEARS EVEN FROM HIS CLOSEST SUPPORTERS AND FANS IS HIS INSISTENCE THAT HUMAN AFFAIRS CAN SOMEHOW BE MAGICALLY EXPLAINED WITHIN THE TIGHT PARAMETERS OF THIS DOGMATIC SCIENTIFIC APPROACH: WHERE LOGIC AND EVIDENCE ARE THE ONLY REQUIREMENTS OF AN ARGUMENT. HUMAN BEINGS ARE INCREDIBLY COMPLEX ILLOGICAL AND EMOTIONAL CREATURES AND THEREFORE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THEIR VARIOUS CULTURES WIDE RANGE OF BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS DESIRES POLITICAL ALLEGIANCES TRIBAL PREJUDICES AND CRISIS OF IDENTITY THROUGH THE PRISM OF SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING BY ITSELF IS AN IDEA BUILT ON FOUNDATIONS OF SAND. THE LATE GARY BECKER A NOBEL PRIZE-WINNING ECONOMIST AND ONE OF THE GREAT CHAMPIONS OF THE NEO-LIBERAL MOVEMENT DURING THE ??70S TRIED TO APPLY SIMILAR CREDENTIALS TO GLOBAL CAPITALISM: TURNING ECONOMICS AT THE TIME FROM BEING A DISCIPLINE THAT TALKED ABOUT TRADITIONAL SUBJECTS LIKE INFLATION EMPLOYMENT BANKS AND STOCKS TO SUDDENLY HUBRISTICALLY CLAIMING IT COULD NOW UNDERSTAND ALL OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR. ECONOMICS LIKE SCIENCE IS SIMPLY INCAPABLE OF DOING THIS. DAWKINS??S MOST VOCAL OPPONENTS SEEM TO MISS THIS VERY SALIENT POINT FOCUSING THEIR EFFORTS INSTEAD ON HIS LACK OF POLITICAL CORRECTNESS: A PARTICULAR OBSESSION FOR WHITE-MIDDLE-CLASS-INTELLECTUAL-ELITES IN THE WEST. THEY CLAIM THAT HIS RIDICULING OF ISLAM FOR EXAMPLE BORDERS ON RACISM. TO WHICH DAWKINS TYPICALLY RESPONDS: ISLAM IS A RELIGION NOT A RACE. IT??S A VALID POINT. I ALSO HAPPEN TO THINK THAT ANY RELIGION??REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT??S CHRISTIANITY ISLAM BUDDHISM OR JUDAISM??SHOULD BE OPEN TO RIDICULE SATIRE AND BLASPHEMY. ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT IN OUR PRESENT AGE RIDICULING THE PROPHET MUHAMMAD IS NOW DEEMED AN ACT PUNISHABLE BY DEATH BY HARDCORE FUNDAMENTALIST JIHADISTS. HOWEVER BY THE SAME TOKEN IN THE SWEEPING ONE-SENTENCE GENERALIZATIONS DAWKINS SO OFTEN GIVES WHEN SPEAKING ABOUT RELIGION??WHICH HE TENDS TO MASQUERADE AS AN INSISTENCE ON LOGICAL ANSWERS??THE COMPLEXITY OF HUMAN CULTURE SEEMS TO GET BRUSHED ASIDE AND THE ARGUMENT GETS LOST OR DOESN??T EVEN TAKE PLACE AT ALL. IT??S AS IF FACTS FOR DAWKINS??AND NOT HUMAN EMOTION OR FEELING??ARE ALL THAT MATTER IN THIS WORLD. I SUSPECT THERE MAY BE A VALID REASON FOR THIS THOUGH. IN HIS SPECIALIZED FIELD EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY FOR THE MOST PART DAWKINS IS NOT DEALING WITH HUMAN BEINGS AS HIS SUBJECT MATTER. IN BRIEF CANDLE IN THE DARK HE EVEN POINTS OUT THAT IT??S RIDICULOUS TO THINK OF EVOLUTIONARY THEORY ALWAYS CULMINATING IN MAN. AND HE MAKES IT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT HOMO SAPIENS SHOULD NOT BE PRIVILEGED OVER OTHER SPECIES. HOWEVER IN THE WORLD OF JOURNALISM POLITICS HISTORY AND CULTURE A WORLD FOR WHICH DAWKINS HAS TRIED BUT ULTIMATELY FAILED TO BECOME A GLOBAL SPOKESPERSON IN RECENT YEARS NUANCE DEBATE PARADOXES AND CONTRADICTIONS ARE UBIQUITOUS. AND MOST IMPORTANT THEY ARE VITAL IN KEEPING THE DISCUSSION INTERESTING DEMOCRATIC AND ROBUST AT ALL TIMES. DAWKINS REPEATEDLY INSISTS??ON TWITTER MOST DAYS??THAT THE HISTORY OF RELIGION IS INSPIRED BY NOTHING MORE THAN TOTALITARIAN CONTROL AND BLOODSHED. THERE IS CERTAINLY TRUTH IN THIS WORLDVIEW. I TOO HAVE WRITTEN ABOUT THE COLLUSION BETWEEN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND THE STATE IN IRELAND AND ABOUT THE TOTALITARIAN TENDENCIES BEHIND THAT COLLABORATION. BUT TO DOGMATICALLY INSIST??AS DAWKINS TENDS TO??THAT ANY FORM OF RELIGION IS ALWAYS IDIOTIC INHERENTLY VIOLENT AND ALMOST INFANTILE IN ITS INTELLECTUAL CONSTRUCTION IS TO LAUGH IN THE FACE OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION AND HISTORY. IT??S ALSO TO IGNORE A VERY IMPORTANT TRAIT OF HUMAN BEINGS: EMPATHY. I ONCE WATCHED AN IRISH TV SHOW WHERE A WOMAN EXPLAINED TO DAWKINS THAT THE NOTION OF A GOD GAVE HER COMFORT WHEN A MEMBER OF HER FAMILY DIED. DAWKINS LOOKED AT HER DIRECTLY AND SAID ??THAT IS FINE BUT I??M AFRAID IT??S SIMPLY NOT TRUE.? I THINK HE MISSES THE POINT RELIGION MAY PLAY FOR SOME PEOPLE. IN WIRED FOR CULTURE EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGIST MARK PAGEL ARGUES THAT RELIGIOUS MEMES HISTORICALLY HAVE HELPED HUMANS TO SURVIVE COOPERATE AND PROSPER. CRUCIALLY THOUGH PAGEL DOES NOT INSIST ON THE NEED TO BELIEVE THAT THE IDEAS CONTAINED WITHIN RELIGIONS ARE NECESSARILY TRUE TO BE BENEFICIAL TO HUMAN CULTURE. SIMILARLY JARED DIAMOND??A FELLOW SCIENTIST AND ATHEIST FOR WHOM DAWKINS HAS ENORMOUS RESPECT??IN +THE WORLD UNTIL YESTERDAY STATES ??IF RELIGION DIDN??T BRING SOME REAL BENEFITS TO OFFSET THOSE OPPORTUNITY COSTS ANY ATHEISTIC SOCIETY THAT BY CHANCE AROSE WOULD BE LIKELY TO OUTCOMPETE RELIGIOUS SOCIETIES AND TAKE OVER THE WORLD. [RELIGION] MUST HAVE FUNCTIONS AND BRING BENEFITS [OTHERWISE] IT WOULDN??T HAVE COME INTO BEING AND COULDN??T BE MAINTAINED.? EVEN THE OUTSPOKEN ATHEIST PHILOSOPHER NEUROSCIENTIST AND PROMOTER OF ALL THINGS SECULAR SAM HARRIS??WHO REGARDS DAWKINS AS HIS INTELLECTUAL HERO??CLAIMS FEW SCIENTISTS AND PHILOSOPHERS HAVE DEVELOPED STRONG SKILLS OF INTROSPECTION. HARRIS ALSO INSISTS THAT THERE IS A CONNECTION BETWEEN SCIENTIFIC FACT AND SPIRITUAL WISDOM AND THAT IT IS MORE DIRECT THAN MOST PEOPLE SUPPOSE. THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THE GOD DELUSION WHICH HAS SOLD THREE MILLION COPIES WAS VITALLY IMPORTANT IN RAISING THE BAR ABOUT HOW TO SPEAK UP FOR SECULAR AND RATIONAL VALUES IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN WHEN IT WAS PUBLISHED ALMOST A DECADE AGO. BUT IT APPEARS AS THOUGH DAWKINS HAS NO INTEREST IN EXPLORING THE FACT THAT MANY HUMANS??AT SOME POINT IN THEIR LIVES??SEEK OUT SOMETHING GREATER THAN THEMSELVES. CALL THIS WHAT YOU LIKE: A SPIRITUAL OTHERNESS AN INNER INTROSPECTION OR EVEN A SENSE OF SACREDNESS BEYOND THE COSMOS. THE KEY POINT IS THIS: THE MAIN DESIRE FOR THAT ??OTHERNESS? IN THE FIRST PLACE MEANS IT PURPOSELY WANTS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MATERIAL WORLD. IT HAS NO RELATIONSHIP WITH FACTS OR EVIDENCE. IT??S SIMPLY A STATE OF MIND AND A YEARNING FOR SOMETHING DEEPER OR WIDER THAN THAT CONSTANT PRISON CELL OF HUMAN ILLUSION WE POLITELY REFER TO IN OUR EVERYDAY LIVES AS ??THE SELF.? IN SPITE OF DAWKINS??S CONSTANT DAILY ONLINE PROTESTATIONS IT??S PRETTY HARD TO ENVISION A TIME WHEN RELIGION WILL COMPLETELY VANISH OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH. BECAUSE NO MATTER HOW MUCH SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE NO MATTER HOW MANY THEORIES OR MATHEMATICAL EXPLANATIONS WE ACCUMULATE ABOUT THE UNIVERSE THAT KNOWLEDGE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO COMPLETELY REPLACE A NEED??IN CERTAIN PEOPLE??FOR MYTHOLOGY FANTASY AND RITUAL NONE OF WHICH HAS ANY BASIS OR FOUNDATION IN MATERIAL TRUTH. ,48889.0

AS YOU MAY HAVE SEEN PAULA JONES REAPPEARED ON SUNDAY GIVING A LENGTHY INTERVIEW TO A CONSERVATIVE RADIO HOST THAT BRIETBART.COM PANTINGLY PROMOTED CHARGING THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS THE ENEMY OF AMERICAN WOMEN. THE SAME DAY CLINTON WAS HECKLED?ŸUP IN NEW HAMPSHIRE BY A FEMALE REPUBLICAN STATE REPRESENTATIVE TO ANSWER FOR THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST HER HUSBAND REGARDING TWO WOMEN WHO SAY BILL CLINTON ASSAULTED OR RAPED THEM. BACK WE GO TO THE 1990S. WILL ANY OF THIS MATTER? MOST OF IT WON??T. THE VAST MAJORITY OF VOTERS AREN??T GOING TO CARE ABOUT THE 20- AND 30-YEAR OLD ALLEGED SEXUAL ACTIVITIES OF AN ALMOST SEPTUAGENARIAN MAN. BUT HILLARY DOES HAVE A POTENTIAL ACHILLES HEEL HERE WHICH SHE OPENED THE DOOR TO HERSELF WITH ONE WORD SHE UTTERED BACK IN SEPTEMBER AND SHE MAY YET HAVE A LITTLE EXPLAINING TO DO HERE TO NAIL DOWN A VOTING BLOC THAT SHE??S GOING TO NEED IN A BIG WAY COME NOVEMBER. FIRST WHAT WON??T MATTER. MONICA LEWINSKY WON??T MATTER. GENNIFER FLOWERS WON??T MATTER. THESE WERE CONSENSUAL RELATIONSHIPS. WHATEVER ELSE PEOPLE MIGHT THINK OF BILL??S JUDGMENT MOST FOLKS QUITE RIGHTLY CONSIDER THESE AFFAIRS TO BE HIS (AND THE WOMEN??S) PRIVATE BUSINESS. EITHER COULD DECIDE TO MAKE TROUBLE IF THEY WANTED TO I GUESS ESPECIALLY LEWINSKY BUT I HAVE TROUBLE SEEING HOW BIG TROUBLE COULD REALLY BE MADE. BUT WHAT ABOUT JONES AND KATHLEEN WILLEY AND JUANITA BROADDRICK? THEY CLAIM NOT THAT THEY HAD CONSENSUAL RELATIONS WITH BILL BUT THAT HE DID UNWANTED THINGS TO THEM. JONES SAID HE EXPOSED HIMSELF TO HER AND PROPOSITIONED HER IN 1991. WILLEY CHARGED HE GROPED HER IN THE WHITE HOUSE IN 1993. AND BROADDRICK ALLEGED THAT HE RAPED HER IN 1978. THESE THINGS HAVE ALL BEEN MASTICATED A THOUSAND-MILLION TIMES. BILL CLINTON DENIES ALL THREE ALLEGATIONS. WITH JONES HE SETTLED A CIVIL SUIT FOR $850000 ADMITTING NO GUILT. SHE DIDN??T HELP HER CASE BACK THEN BY ATTACHING HERSELF TO CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT LAWYERS AND ORGANIZATIONS?Ÿ AND LETTING HER SUIT BECOME THE VEHICLE FOR WHAT WAS UNDENIABLY A CONSPIRACY??PERHAPS NOT VAST AS HILLARY FAMOUSLY CHARGED ON THE TODAY SHOW IN 1998 BUT CERTAINLY RIGHT WING??TO LAY CLINTON LOW BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY. WITH RESPECT TO WILLEY SHE CHANGED HER STORY AND WAS ULTIMATELY REGARDED BY THE INDEPENDENT COUNSEL THAT WAS SNIFFING CLINTON??S BED SHEETS AS AN UNRELIABLE WITNESS.?Ÿ BROADDRICK??S CHARGE IS OBVIOUSLY THE MOST SERIOUS BUT INCONSISTENCIES HAVE BEEN NOTED HERE TOO AND IT??S NOW ALMOST 40 YEARS OLD. WILLEY AND BROADDRICK HAVEN??T BEEN THAT VOCAL RECENTLY. FOR HER PART JONES SAYS...WELL LOTS OF STUFF: HILLARY ??NEEDS TO DO A PUBLIC APOLOGY OR SOMETHING OR OTHER (FOR) ALL THE WOMEN WHO HAVE COME OUT AND SAID PUBLICLY WHAT HER HUSBAND DID TO THEM. YES SHE DOES. I BELIEVE SHE DOES? HILLARY IS ??SUCH A LIAR. AND SHE??S SO TWO FACED. I NEVER ONCE WAS CONTACTED BY HER. NOT ONE TIME AND APOLOGIZED ABOUT WHAT HER HUSBAND DID TO ME? ??I DON??T SEE HOW WOMEN WOULD EVEN BE ABLE TO TRUST HER IF THE MAN WHO IS HER HUSBAND WHO HAS ABUSED AND HARASSED AND DID OTHER THINGS TO WOMEN AND SHE KNEW ABOUT IT.? IF JONES HAD MORE SAVVY SHE??D HAVE PLANNED HER REEMERGENCE A LOT MORE CLEVERLY THAN SHE DID. INSTEAD OF GOING TO CONSERVATIVE TALK RADIO SHE??D HAVE TRIED NPR OR SOMETHING. MAYBE NPR WOULDN??T TOUCH IT BUT SOMEPLACE MORE MAINSTREAM AND SHE??D HAVE SAID SOMETHING LIKE: YES I REGRET THAT I LET MY CASE GET HIJACKED BY PEOPLE WITH OTHER AGENDAS THAT WAS WRONG BUT THEY WERE THE ONLY ONES LISTENING TO ME AT THE TIME. IF HER GOAL IS ACTUALLY TO KEEP HILLARY CLINTON OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE SHE NEEDS TO MOVE THE NEEDLE GET PEOPLE TO TAKE HER SERIOUSLY WHO DIDN??T THEN AND SHE SURE DIDN??T ACCOMPLISH THAT. BUT HILLARY CLINTON STILL ISN??T IN THE CLEAR HERE. BACK LAST SEPTEMBER IN IOWA SHE SAID THE WORDS: ??TODAY I WANT TO SEND A MESSAGE TO EVERY SURVIVOR OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. DON'T LET ANYONE SILENCE YOUR VOICE. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE HEARD. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE BELIEVED AND WE??RE WITH YOU.? OBVIOUSLY ??BELIEVED? IS THE OPERATIVE WORD THERE AND QUITE REASONABLY CONSERVATIVES POUNCED ON IT AT THE TIME OH WELL THEN DO JONES/WILLEY/BROADDRICK DESERVE TO BE ??BELIEVED?? AS MICHELLE GOLDBERG NOTED LAST WEEK AT SLATE A VOTER ASKED CLINTON ESSENTIALLY THIS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE IN DECEMBER AND HER ANSWER WASN??T THE GREATEST: ??WELL I WOULD SAY THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD BE BELIEVED AT FIRST UNTIL THEY ARE DISBELIEVED BASED ON EVIDENCE.? THE OTHER POTENTIAL COMPLICATION FOR CLINTON MAY CENTER AROUND THE QUESTION OF WHAT SHE DID IF ANYTHING TO DISCREDIT JONES AND THE OTHERS. JONES SAID THIS IN HER INTERVIEW TOO. IT??S BEEN A GIVEN FOR YEARS ON THE ANTI-CLINTON RIGHT THAT HILLARY MACBETH ORCHESTRATED VICIOUS CAMPAIGNS TO DISCREDIT THESE WOMEN. THE MAINSTREAM PRESS HAS NEVER REALLY PICKED THIS UP TO CONSERVATIVES THAT??S BECAUSE OF LIBERAL MEDIA BIAS TO THE REST OF US IT??S BECAUSE THERE??S BEEN NO HARD EVIDENCE OF THIS AND BECAUSE THERE EXISTS A LONG LONG LONG LIST OF THINGS THEY??VE ACCUSED HILLARY OF DOING THAT SHE PRETTY OBVIOUSLY NEVER DID. CHANCES ARE ASSUMING NO CORROBORATING EVIDENCE TURNS UP IN ANY OF THESE THREE CASES MOST VOTERS AREN??T GOING TO BE VERY INTERESTED. BUT HILLARY CLINTON STILL HAS TO THINK THROUGH HOW SHE HANDLES THIS. AS GOLDBERG NOTED IN HER PIECE THE POLITICS AROUND SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT HAVE CHANGED A LOT SINCE THE 1990S IN WAYS THAT ARE FOR THE BETTER IN GENERAL BUT SURE DON??T STRENGTHEN HILLARY??S HAND IF/WHEN SHE HAS TO DISCUSS THESE CASES DIRECTLY. IN ADDITION SHE??LL NEED TO BEAR IN MIND WHEN SHE DOES TALK ABOUT ALL THIS THAT FOR MOST WOMEN VOTERS THIS STORY ISN??T ABOUT THE OLD ??VAST RIGHT-WING CONSPIRACY? OF WHICH MOST WILL HAVE AT BEST A FLEETING MEMORY. IT??S ABOUT THE REALITY OF SEXUAL PREDATION IN THEIR LIVES. THAT STATE REPRESENTATIVE FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE WHO HECKLED HER WAS ??VERY RUDE? AS CLINTON SAID BUT SHE IS ALSO A RAPE SURVIVOR AS ARE MILLIONS OF OTHER AMERICAN WOMEN. THAT??S THE AUDIENCE CLINTON WILL NEED TO SPEAK TO NOT LIBERALS WHO REMEMBER WHO LINDA TRIPP WAS. SHE??LL NEED A BIG WOMEN??S VOTE. COMPARED TO ANY OF THE REPUBLICANS SHE HAS THE TRACK RECORD TO HAVE EARNED IT. CONSERVATIVES OF COURSE KNOW THIS SO CARRYING ON ABOUT BILL IS THE WAY THEY??LL TRY TO NEUTRALIZE HER ADVANTAGE. IT??S A BIT RICH TO SEE MEMBERS OF THE PARTY THAT VOTED AGAINST THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT AMONG NUMEROUS OTHER POSITIONS PLAYING THE ROLE OF DEFENDERS OF WOMEN BUT THAT??S HOW IT??S GOING TO BE. CLINTON MIGHT HAVE TO DANCE AWAY FROM THAT ??BELIEVED? AT SOME POINT AND IT??S GOING TO BE A DELICATE DANCE. ,379446.0

WITH HELP FROM FUNK GUITARIST CARLOS ALOMAR AND VOCALIST/SONGWRITER LUTHER VANDROSS BOWIE DOVE HEADFIRST INTO FUNK AND PHILLY SOUL??OR HIS CLOSEST APPROXIMATION OF IT. ??I STARTED MAKING LITTLE VOCAL ARRANGEMENTS AND SHOWING THEM TO [ALOMAR??S WIFE AND FAMED SESSION VOCALIST] ROBIN? VANDROSS RECALLED IN A 1983 INTERVIEW WITH BLACK COLLEGIAN. ??I DIDN??T KNOW THAT BOWIE HAD OVERHEARD ALL THIS. HE WAS SITTING RIGHT BEHIND ME AT THE BOARD AND HE SAID ??THAT??S A GREAT IDEA. PUT THAT DOWN.?? SO I PUT IT DOWN AND NEXT THING YOU KNOW ONE THING LED TO ANOTHER AND I WAS DOING THE VOCAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE WHOLE ALBUM. I WROTE ONE OF THE SONGS ON THE ALBUM. BOWIE OVERHEARD IT AND SAID ??I WANT TO RECORD THAT. DO YOU MIND???? ??BOWIE MADE ME GO OUT AND DO AN OPENING FORTY-FIVE MINUTE ACT FOR HIM EVERY NIGHT WITH MY OWN MATERIAL? VANDROSS SHARED. ??I REMEMBER THE FIRST NIGHT I WENT ONSTAGE AND DID MY THING. SOME OF THE PEOPLE IT WAS SCATTERED WERE SHOUTING ??BOWIE BOWIE.?? THAT WAS VERY DISCONCERTING TO ME THAT NIGHT. BOWIE SAID ??PLEASE. LATER FOR THESE PEOPLE. LATER FOR THEM. YOU GO OUT THERE AND GET YOUR ART TOGETHER.??? 1975??S YOUNG AMERICANS GAVE BOWIE HIS FIRST BIG POP HITS IN AMERICA WITH THE TITLE TRACK AND THE JOHN LENNON-ASSISTED NO. 1 HIT ??FAME? BUT BY THE TIME OF ITS RELEASE HE??D BEEN LIVING IN NEW YORK CITY AND BEGUN SESSIONS FOR STATION TO STATION. THE LEAD SINGLE ??GOLDEN YEARS? CONTINUED IN BOWIE??S FUNK VEIN AND HE PERFORMED IT AND ??FAME? DURING A FAMOUS APPEARANCE ON SOUL TRAIN THAT YEAR??LATER REVEALING HE WAS INTOXICATED THE ENTIRE TIME HAVING GOTTEN DRUNK TO CALM HIS NERVES. DESPITE THE GROOVES ON ??GOLDEN YEARS? AND THE SOUL TRAIN APPEARANCE THE STATION TO STATION ALBUM WAS THE BEGINNING OF BOWIE TRANSITION INTO HIS NEXT PHASE MUSICALLY AND HIS NEXT STRANGER PERSONA. HE WAS STARTING TO EMBRACE MORE QUASI-EUROPEAN SOUNDS LIKE KRAUTROCK AND COLDER MORE DETACHED SYNTH-DRIVEN MUSIC. BUT HIS ADDICTIONS WERE SENDING HIM TO A DARK PLACE. IT HAS BEEN WELL-DOCUMENTED THAT BOWIE WAS INTRIGUED BY NAZI IMAGERY IN THE COKE-ADDLED PERIOD FOLLOWING YOUNG AMERICANS. HE??D BEEN INTRODUCED TO GERMAN HISTORY BY BRITISH WRITER CHRISTOPHER ISHERWOOD WHOM BOWIE HAD MET AFTER A CONCERT IN LOS ANGELES IN 1974. IT WAS TWO YEARS BEFORE HE ACTUALLY MOVED TO WEST BERLIN??FOLLOWING AN INTENSELY DARK PERIOD WHERE HE CREATED HIS COLD ??THIN WHITE DUKE? PERSONA WAS TERRIBLY ADDICTED TO COCAINE FLIRTING WITH THE OCCULT SURVIVING ON RED PEPPERS AND MILK AND MAKING BIZARRE CLAIMS IN THE PRESS ABOUT HITLER AND HOW FASCISM COULD HELP BRITAIN. HE WAS DETAINED IN POLAND FOR TRAVELING WITH NAZI PARAPHERNALIA. AND IN 1976 CAME THE INFAMOUS ??VICTORIA STATION INCIDENT? WHEN BOWIE WAS PICTURED GIVING WHAT APPEARED TO BE A NAZI SALUTE??A CLAIM HE CONSISTENTLY DENIED. HIS TIME IN WEST BERLIN SEEMED TO TURN HIM AGAINST FASCISM. HIS MYTHOLOGIZING OF THE CITY HAD BEEN TIED TO HIS ROMANTICIZING OF ??OLD EUROPE? BORN OF DISILLUSIONMENT WITH AMERICA AND WITH STANDARD ROCK MUSIC. BOWIE LATER BLAMED HIS NAZI FETISH ON DRUGS AND ??CRAZED? QUOTES AND IT COULD BE ARGUED THAT HE WAS MORE INTO THE INDULGENCES OF FASCISM THAN THE IDEOLOGY BUT HIS IMAGE CHANGE COINCIDED WITH THE RISE OF EXTREME RIGHT HATE GROUPS IN ENGLAND AND BOTH HE AND ERIC CLAPTON (WHO DELIVERED A NOTORIOUSLY RACIST RANT AT A BIRMINGHAM CONCERT ?ŸIN 1976 THE SAME YEAR AS BOWIE??S INFAMOUS SALUTE) WERE NAME-DROPPED BY THOSE WHO??D ORGANIZED ROCK AGAINST RACISM AS REASONS FOR THE ORGANIZATION??S INCEPTION. BUT BOWIE-AS-RACIST SEEMED TO CONTRADICT SO MUCH OF WHO HE??D BEEN PREVIOUSLY AND WHERE HE WOULD GO IN THE COMING DECADE. AFTER ALL FROM 1974-1978 BOWIE WAS INVOLVED ROMANTICALLY WITH MOTOWN SINGER AVA CHERRY AKA BLACK BARBARELLA. SOME OF HIS PROBLEMATIC BEHAVIOR WAS BLAMED ON DRUGS SOME ON THE ??THIN WHITE DUKE? PERSONA HE??D ADOPTED. DURING HIS FINAL DAYS IN BERLIN THE SINGER HAD SEEN HIS NAME SPRAYED ON A WALL (SOME HAVE SUGGESTED IT WAS THE BERLIN WALL BUT THAT WASN??T CONFIRMED) AND THE LAST TWO LETTERS WERE FRAMED IN A SWASTIKA. IT DISTURBED HIM TO SEE HIMSELF LINKED SO EXPLICITLY TO NAZISM AND ANY APPEAL THE IMAGERY HAD BECAME TROUBLING. DABBLING IN THE DARKNESS WAS NOT GOING TO BE HIS APPROACH GOING FORWARD AND REFERENCES TO FASCISM AND THE OCCULT DISAPPEARED FROM HIS PERSONA ALTOGETHER. BY 1979 BOWIE HAD DROPPED THE DUKE IMAGE AND REFERRED TO IT AS ??A NASTY CHARACTER FOR ME.? BY THE EARLY 1980S HE WAS CLEAN DIVORCED (FROM HIS FIRST WIFE ANGIE) AND HEALTHY. HE WAS IN NEW YORK WORKING WITH SUPERPRODUCER NILE RODGERS ON WHAT WOULD BECOME A HUGE CROSSOVER ALBUM FOR HIS CAREER. LET??S DANCE WAS BOWIE ??GOING BLACK? AGAIN AND HE SOUNDED MORE COMFORTABLE THAN HE HAD ON THE SOMEWHAT CONTRIVED YOUNG AMERICANS FROM SEVEN YEARS EARLIER. BOWIE WAS AT HIS MOST AVANT-GARDE DURING THE RISE OF DISCO AND THE DISDAIN FOR THAT GENRE EXPRESSED BY MANY ROCK FANS WAS ROOTED IN THE KIND OF RACIAL PREJUDICE HINTED AT IN THE GOODMAN INTERVIEW. BUT BOWIE THE ROCK VETERAN TAPPED THE PRODUCER WHO??D MADE THE BEST RECORDS OF THE DISCO ERA TO PRODUCE HIS NEW ALBUM LONG AFTER DISCO??S HEYDAY. ??AT THE TIME IN MY LIFE THAT I WAS PERSONA NON GRATA WHEN NO ONE WOULD WORK WITH ME BECAUSE OF ??DISCO SUCKS??? RODGERS RECALLED SHORTLY AFTER BOWIE??S DEATH ??THIS GUY WHO WAS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE GREAT INNOVATIVE ROCKERS PICKED A DISCO GUY WHO NOBODY WANTED TO WORK WITH TO COLLABORATE WITH AND WE WOUND UP MAKING THE BIGGEST RECORD OF HIS CAREER.? ??DAVID LISTENED TO ME. I REMEMBER ONCE EXPLAINING TO HIM HOW FOR ME AS A BLACK ARTIST IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO GET HITS BECAUSE WE HAD FEWER RADIO STATIONS TO EXPOSE OUR MUSIC. SO TO GET ATTENTION A TECHNIQUE OF MINE WAS I ALWAYS STARTED MY SONGS WITH THE CHORUS: ??AHHH FREAK OUT!?? AND ??WE ARE FAMILY!?? AND THEN OF COURSE THERE??S ??LET??S DANCE.?? SO WHEN DAVID GAVE ME THIS AWARD??FOR THE ARCHIVE OF CONTEMPORARY MUSIC??HE SAID: ??TO MY FRIEND NILE RODGERS: THE ONLY MAN WHO COULD MAKE ME START A SONG WITH A CHORUS.??? RODGERS HELPED REINVIGORATE BOWIE IN THE MUSIC VIDEO ERA AND THE HIGH-PROFILE SUCCESS HE??D SUDDENLY ATTAINED MAY HAVE FRUSTRATED HIM LATER BUT IT INITIALLY SPARKED A SPIRIT OF ADVOCACY. IT WAS DURING THIS PERIOD THAT HE??D BECOME FAIRLY OUTSPOKEN ON THE ISSUE OF RACISM. ??AS MUCH AS I LOVE THIS COUNTRY IT??S PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST RACIALLY INTOLERANT IN THE WORLD WELL IN LINE WITH SOUTH AFRICA? HE TOLD ROLLING STONE IN 1983 WHEN DISCUSSING HIS TIME IN AUSTRALIA. ??I MEAN IN THE NORTH THERE??S UNBELIEVABLE INTOLERANCE. THE ABORIGINES CAN??T EVEN BUY THEIR DRINKS IN THE SAME BARS??THEY HAVE TO GO ROUND THE BACK AND GET THEM THROUGH WHAT??S CALLED A ??DOG HATCH.?? AND THEN THEY??RE FORBIDDEN FROM DRINKING THEM ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE?ŸSTREET?ŸAS THE BAR THEY HAVE TO GO TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD.? ??IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT ONE DOESN??T HAVE MUCH?ŸTIME?ŸON THE PLANET YOU KNOW?? HE STATED. ??AND THAT I COULD DO SOMETHING MORE USEFUL IN TERMS OF....I KNOW THIS IS VERY?ŸCLICH?? BUT I FEEL THAT NOW THAT I??M THIRTY-SIX YEARS OLD AND I??VE GOT A CERTAIN POSITION I WANT TO START UTILIZING THAT POSITION TO THE BENEFIT OF MY...BROTHERHOOD AND SISTERHOOD.? HE WINCES BUT CONTINUES. ??I??VE FOUND IT??S VERY EASY TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN OTHER TERMS BUT I THINK YOU CAN??T KEEP ON BEING AN ARTIST WITHOUT ACTUALLY SAYING ANYTHING MORE THAN ??WELL THIS IS AN INTERESTING WAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS.??? ??THERE IS ALSO A?ŸRIGHT?ŸWAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS: THERE??S A LOT OF INJUSTICE. SO LET??S YOU KNOW SAY SOMETHING ABOUT IT. HOWEVER NAFF IT COMES OFF.? WHEN DISCUSSING THE CONCEPTS BEHIND THE VIDEOS FROM THE ALBUM BOWIE MADE IT CLEAR: ??VERY SIMPLE VERY DIRECT. THEY??RE ALMOST LIKE RUSSIAN SOCIAL REALISM VERY NAIVE. AND THE MESSAGE THAT THEY HAVE IS VERY SIMPLE?? IT??S WRONG TO BE RACIST!? THE VIDEO FOR ??LET??S DANCE? FOCUSED ON AN INDIGENOUS COUPLE IN AUSTRALIA (WITH REFERENCES TO SLAVERY AND ABORIGINAL CHILDREN WHO??D BEEN KIDNAPPED) BUT THE ??CHINA GIRL? VIDEO WAS MORE UNCOMFORTABLE BORDERING ON THE FETISHIZING OF ??EXOTIC? ASIAN WOMANHOOD IN WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A MESSAGE ABOUT INTERRACIAL LOVE. BOWIE WOULD SPEND THE REST OF THE ??80S WRESTLING WITH MTV-ERA STARDOM BEFORE MARRYING SOMALIAN SUPERMODEL AND PHILANTHROPIST IMAN IN THE EARLY 1990S. DURING A 1993 APPEARANCE ON THE ARSENIO HALL SHOW BOWIE WAS ASKED WHETHER HE OR IMAN HAD EVER BEEN GIVEN A HARD TIME FOR BEING IN AN INTERRACIAL RELATIONSHIP. ??THAT??S A VERY STRANGE SITUATION FOR ME BECAUSE I THINK WITH BOTH OF US HAVING THE SO-CALLED ??CELEBRITY STATUS?? ATTACHED TO US I THINK THE MOMENT WE STEP OUT THE DOORS WE??RE KNOWN MORE AS DAVID AND IMAN SO I??M NOT SURE WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE FOR US? SAID BOWIE. ??FUNNILY ENOUGH YOU DON??T SEE THAT MANY MIXED COUPLES IN AMERICA. IN EUROPE THERE ARE A LOT OF MIXED COUPLES. OVER HERE IT??S STILL A RARITY THERE??S STILL THIS GREAT SEPARATIST KIND OF THING OVER HERE. SO I DON??T KNOW WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE FOR US IF WE WEREN??T KNOWN IN OUR OWN RIGHT. YOU GET THE ODD SNIDE REMARK BUT NOTHING OF ANY WEIGHT.? ??IT DOESN??T BUG YOU THOUGH?? ARSENIO PRODDED. ??IT WOULD DO YEAH. IT WOULD BUG ME A LOT? BOWIE REPLIED. ??I??D GET MAD. I??D HIT HIM LIKE A LORRY DRIVER??NO LIKE A TRUCK DRIVER!? LATER ON IN THE INTERVIEW ARSENIO WOULD PRAISE BOWIE FOR DONATING THE PROCEEDS FROM HIS SINGLE ??BLACK TIE WHITE NOISE? TO AN EDUCATIONAL CENTER FOR AT-RISK BLACK KIDS. ?Ÿ THAT SAME YEAR BOWIE WAS INTERVIEWED ON THE TODAY SHOW WHERE HE EXPRESSED HIS ADMIRATION FOR HIP-HOP??S TOPICALITY. ??YOU WERE SAYING THAT THE ONLY PEOPLE IN THE MUSIC BUSINESS NOW IN YOUR OPINION WHO WERE BEING TRULY CREATIVE WERE THE RAPPERS? HOST BRYANT GUMBEL ASKED. ??YES I BELIEVE THAT??S SO? BOWIE RESPONDED. ??THE QUALITY AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOCIAL MESSAGE HAS MOVED VERY MUCH TO THE BLACK AND HISPANIC MARKET. AND THAT??S WHERE THE NEW FORCE OF MUSIC IS COMING FROM...WITH BLACK MUSIC THERE??S A VERY STRONG SOCIAL POINT TO MAKE. THERE??S A MEANS OF DISCOVERY AND A PURPOSE.? IN 2007 WHEN SIX BLACK TEENS WERE CHARGED IN AN ALLEGED ATTACK ON A WHITE CLASSMATE IN THE TINY CENTRAL LOUISIANA TOWN OF JENA BOWIE CONTRIBUTED $10000 TO A LEGAL DEFENSE FUND FOR THE YOUNGSTERS WHO??D BEEN TARGETED WITH HATE CRIMES PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT. BOWIE??S HISTORY WITH RACE AND RACISM IS MUCH LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE IN HIS PUBLIC LIFE A STUDY IN PHASES. WHETHER YOU WANT TO DECLARE HIM ??PROGRESSIVE? IS DEBATABLE BUT HE SEEMED TO AT LEAST BELIEVE IN THE REDEMPTION THAT COULD COME FROM ADDRESSING ILLS AS HE SAW THEM ESPECIALLY AS THEY AFFECTED MUSIC AND ART. HIS NAZI FLIRTATIONS STAND IN SHARP CONTRAST TO WHO HE??D BEEN THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE BUT THEY MARK A NECESSARY PART OF HIS EVOLUTION. IN DELVING DEEP INTO THE DARKEST FACETS OF EUROCENTRICITY AND WHITE SUPREMACY MAYBE BOWIE SAW AN UGLINESS STARING BACK AT HIM THAT HE COULDN??T STOMACH. IT WOULD BE CYNICAL TO DISMISS HIS PUBLIC STATEMENTS AS SIMPLE PR MOVES EVEN AS HE WAS DECADES REMOVED FROM THE THIN WHITE DUKE PERIOD BUT IT WOULD BE NA??VE TO ASSUME HE DIDN??T HAVE TO WORK TO UNPACK WHATEVER HE??D ABSORBED IDEOLOGICALLY IN THE MID-1970S. REGARDLESS IT??S WORTH NOTING THAT THIS MAN WAS ABLE TO ADDRESS ISSUES THAT SO MANY OF TODAY??S WHITE SUPERSTARS SEEM ALL TOO EAGER TO RUN FROM. IN AN AGE WHERE RACISM IS SUCH AN URGENT PART OF THE NATIONAL CONVERSATION MAYBE AMERICA COULD USE A FEW MORE DAVID BOWIES STANDING ALONGSIDE THE BLACK AND BROWN ARTISTS FIGHTING FOR CHANGE. WE DON??T NEED YOU TO SPEAK FOR US BUT THAT DOESN??T MEAN YOU SHOULD REMAIN SILENT. ?Ÿ ,105980.0

HELL EVEN GRIZZLY ADAMS WAS A BLOW. LESS NOTED WAS THE DEATH OF ROBERT STIGWOOD WHO MANAGED THE BEE GEES AND PRODUCED SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER BUT THE FACT OF HIS PASSING DID NOT ESCAPE ME. I??VE HAD A KIND OF SECRET STAKE IN MR. STIGWOOD??S DOINGS FOR THE PAST 40 YEARS GOING BACK ROUGHLY TO THE RELEASE OF THE BEE GEES?? ALBUM MAIN COURSE WHICH REPRESENTED THEIR FIRST FORAY INTO DISCO AND WHICH PRODUCED THE NO. 1 HITS ??JIVE TALKIN??? AND ??NIGHTS ON BROADWAY? THE LATTER OF WHICH AS IT SO HAPPENS MIGHT HAVE SAVED MY WRITING CAREER. THEREFORE I FEEL A PERSONAL ??THANK YOU? TO MR. STIGWOOD AND THE BEE GEES IS IN ORDER ALONG WITH AN EXPLANATION.?Ÿ?Ÿ?Ÿ IN MY HOMETOWN OF SANDPOINT IDAHO IN 1978 THERE WERE THREE KINDS OF GUYS: 1) GUYS WHO HATED THE BEE GEES. 2) GUYS WHO SECRETLY LIKED THE BEE GEES BUT PRETENDED TO HATE THEM. 3) GUYS WHO GOT THEIR ASS KICKED EVERY DAY. I WAS A LOWLY HIGH SCHOOL FRESHMAN THAT YEAR DOING THE SAME THING AS THE OTHER FRESHMEN??ATTEMPTING TO LOOK COOL WHILE REMAINING AS INCONSPICUOUS AS POSSIBLE. THIS SEEMED LIKE THE SAFEST WAY TO NAVIGATE FRESHMAN YEAR. I WAS PRETTY FIRMLY IN CATEGORY #2 ABOVE THOUGH I LIVED IN CONSTANT FEAR OF SOMEHOW BEING FOUND OUT AND SLIPPING DISASTROUSLY INTO CATEGORY #3. CASE IN POINT. WHEN SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER WITH ITS PREDOMINATELY BEE GEES SOUNDTRACK FINALLY MADE IT TO OUR LOCAL MOVIE THEATER THE PANIDA A GANG OF US FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD SMARTASSES DECIDED TO GO MAKE FUN OF IT. WE WEREN??T OLD ENOUGH TO DRIVE SO WE HAD TO WALK SEVERAL BLOCKS FROM MY FRIEND BRYAN CZARAPATA??S HOUSE. THE MOVIE WAS RELEASED IN DECEMBER OF ??77 BUT IT DIDN??T GET TO US UNTIL JANUARY BY WHICH TIME WE??D ALREADY HEARD ALL THE SONGS ON THE RADIO AND LEARNED TO HATE THEM APPROPRIATELY (SEE #2 ABOVE??AND #3). BRYAN??S MOTHER HAD GIVEN HIM A RED SATIN JACKET FOR CHRISTMAS. THIS JACKET INTRODUCED AN ELEMENT OF RISK WHILE DISCO FASHIONS WERE NOT RIDICULED WITH AS MUCH ZEST AS DISCO ITSELF??WE ALL OWNED AT LEAST ONE PAIR OF HASH JEANS AND AT LEAST ONE WIDE-COLLARED POLYESTER SHIRT??IT WAS STILL SAFEST TO GO WITH LEVIS 501S AND A DOWN VEST OR JACKET. BRYAN WAS LIVING DANGEROUSLY IN OTHER WORDS AND ON THE WAY TO THE THEATER HE WAS STRUCK A DEVASTATING BLOW??HIS JACKET WHEN SEEN UNDER THE STREETLIGHTS TURNED A SHADE THAT COULD ONLY BE CALLED HOT PINK. SO MUCH SCORN WAS HEAPED UPON BRYAN AND HIS HOT PINK JOHN TRAVOLTA DISCO JACKET AS IT QUICKLY CAME TO BE CALLED THAT WE HAD NONE LEFT FOR THE FILM. TO THIS DAY AT EVERY HIGH SCHOOL REUNION THE STORY OF THE PINK DISCO JACKET IS HAULED OUT LIKE AN AX TO CHOP MY FRIEND BRYAN INTO TINY PIECES THAT WE FEED TO THE TROPHY-SIZE TROUT IN LAKE PEND OREILLE. THE MOVIE TURNED OUT TO BE GREAT OF COURSE. YOU COULD WALK AROUND THE HALLS SHOUTING ??HEY DON??T HIT THE HAIR!? WITHOUT FEAR OF REPRISAL. BUT YOU STILL HAD TO HATE THE BROTHERS GIBB??EVEN MORE IN FACT WHEN ANOTHER ONE OF THEM ANDY SEEMINGLY MATERIALIZED OUT OF THIN AIR SINGING SONGS THAT ONLY OUR LITTLE SISTERS COULD LOVE. WE WERE TERRIFIED BY THE THOUGHT THAT YET ANOTHER EVEN YOUNGER BEE GEE MIGHT AT ANY MOMENT COME STAGGERING OUT OF THE AUSTRALIAN BUSH WARBLING IN FALSETTO. NEVER MIND THAT YOU CAUGHT YOURSELF HUMMING TO ??NIGHT FEVER? ON KSPT THE LOCAL AM RADIO STATION OR THAT YOU GOT TEARS IN YOUR EYES AS YOU DANCED WITH TAMMI EVANS WHO WAS NOT ONLY GORGEOUS BUT A SENIOR TO ??MORE THAN A WOMAN? ON THE DAY THEY MADE EVERYONE LEARN ??THE HUSTLE? IN GYM CLASS. IN NORTH IDAHO IN 1978 THE BEE GEES AND DISCO IN GENERAL STILL SUCKED??HATING DISCO WAS A SURVIVAL SKILL. IMAGINE MY SURPRISE THEN WHEN THIRTY ODD YEARS LATER BARRY MAURICE AND ROBIN SHOWED UP TO RESCUE THE NOVEL I WAS WRITING. I HAD MADE THE MISTAKE OF TRYING TO READ PROUST WHILE I WAS WORKING ON IT AND THINGS HAD COME TO A SCREECHING HALT. THERE WAS A LOT OF PROUST TO WADE THROUGH AND NOT A LOT OF WRITING GETTING DONE AND I EVENTUALLY BEGAN TO HOPE THE BOOK WOULD SIMPLY WRITE ITSELF. THERE IT SAT DAY AFTER DAY ALL 60 OR SO PAGES OF IT STARING AT ME FROM THE COFFEE TABLE A THIN FILM OF DUST OR POSSIBLY MILDEW ACCUMULATING ON THE TITLE PAGE. IT SAT THERE SO LONG THAT MY 14-YEAR-OLD SON WHO NEVER READ ANYTHING PICKED IT UP AND GAVE IT A GO. HE PRONOUNCED IT NOT ENTIRELY BAD AND ASKED ME WHEN IT WOULD BE FINISHED. I WAS TEMPTED TO SAY NEVER. SO THEN I WAS STAYING FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS WITH A FRIEND OF MINE THE WRITER JOHN MCNALLY. JOHN HAD THE COOLEST BASEMENT EVER WITH A JUKEBOX AND AN OLD REFRIGERATOR STUFFED WITH CRAFT BEERS AND ABOUT 15 CATS THAT ALL MANAGED TO REMAIN HIDDEN SOMEWHERE. JOHN HAD JUST PURCHASED THE JUKEBOX AND WAS IN THE PROCESS OF STOCKING IT WITH 45S. HE WAS TELLING ME SOME OF THE RECORDS HE??D ORDERED ONE OF WHICH WAS THE BEE GEES?? ??NIGHTS ON BROADWAY? WHICH CAME OUT BEFORE WE WERE REQUIRED TO HATE DISCO IN NORTH IDAHO AND WHICH I HAD LOVED WHEN I WAS 12 YEARS OLD. SINCE JOHN DIDN??T HAVE THE 45 YET HE SHOWED ME A YOUTUBE VIDEO OF THE BEE GEES SINGING ??NIGHTS? ON THE MIDNIGHT SPECIAL WHICH FOR THOSE NOT OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER WAS KIND OF A POOR MAN??S MTV BEFORE MTV EXISTED WITH BANDS SUPPOSEDLY PERFORMING THEIR LATEST HITS ??LIVE? THOUGH THEY WERE MOSTLY LIP-SYNCED TO THE STUDIO RECORDINGS. ??NIGHTS ON BROADWAY? IS ONE OF THE SHOW??S MOST FASCINATING ACTUAL LIVE PERFORMANCES. BEE GEES FANS WILL NOTE THE ABSENCE OF THE SOARING FALSETTO LINE OF THE STUDIO VERSION??SINCE BARRY SANG BOTH THE LEAD AND THE FALSETTO ON THE RECORD MAURICE HAD TO TAKE A CRACK AT IT LIVE SINGING BOTH HIS OWN HARMONY VOCALS FROM THE RECORD AND OCCASIONALLY VENTURING INTO BARRY??S IMPOSSIBLY HIGH AND CLEAR RANGE WITH MIXED RESULTS. ROBIN??S PERFORMANCE IS TOUCHINGLY EARNEST: AS USUAL HE SINGS WITH ONE HAND CUPPED OVER HIS RIGHT EAR AS IF TO HEAR HIS OWN VOICE BETTER AND DURING THE INSTRUMENTAL BREAK DILIGENTLY EXECUTES WHAT MUST CERTAINLY BE THE MOST AWKWARD SET OF DANCE MOVES OF THE ENTIRE DISCO ERA. I BECAME A SUCKER FOR THE SONG ALL OVER AGAIN. I VENTURED OUT TO THE LOCAL RECORD STORE IN SEARCH OF THE BEE GEES AND CAME HOME WITH (GULP) THE SOUNDTRACK TO SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER. STANDING THERE AT THE TURNTABLE I HESITATED. THIS WAS THE MOBY DICK OF DISCO THE GREAT WHITE WHALE WE MY FRIENDS AND I HAD BEEN INTENT ONCE ON HUNTING DOWN AND SLAUGHTERING. ??STAYING ALIVE???THAT UNMISTAKABLY HORRIFYING AND SUPREMELY INDELIBLE OPENING BEAT THE RETINA-SEARING IMAGE OF JOHN TRAVOLTA STRUTTING DOWN THAT BROOKLYN AVENUE PAINT CAN IN HAND. ??HOW DEEP IS YOUR LOVE.? ??IF I CAN??T HAVE YOU.? DISCO BALLS AND STROBE-LIT DANCE FLOORS AND PINK SATIN JACKETS. I CLOSED MY EYES DROPPED THE NEEDLE AND PROMPTLY GOT MY ASS KICKED. EVERY SONG WAS A PERFECT LITTLE GEM. IF SIDE 1 WASN??T THE BEST ALBUM SIDE OF THE ENTIRE DECADE IT WAS PRETTY DAMN CLOSE. TO REJECT THIS STUFF YOU HAD TO REJECT THE ENTIRE GENRE THE ENTIRE MOVEMENT??WHICH OF COURSE I REALIZED WAS EXACTLY WHAT WE??D DONE A BUNCH OF TEENAGE GUYS IN IDAHO FOUR WHEELING IN SOMEBODY??S PICKUP TRUCK OUR FIRST BEER CANS CLUTCHED IN OUR FISTS. DISCO BELONGED TO SOMEONE ELSE SOMEWHERE FAR AWAY THE MUSIC OF A SUSPECT BIG CITY CULTURE OF DISCOTHEQUES AND DESIGNER DRUGS AND TRENDY FASHIONS SEXUALLY AMBIGUOUS AND MYSTERIOUSLY MULTICULTURAL WHICH WE WATCHED WITH DISDAIN EVERY SATURDAY MORNING ON AMERICAN BANDSTAND AND NO DOUBT KEENLY ENVIED. IT WAS WINTER IN SOUTH CAROLINA WHERE I LIVE NOW AND IT WAS NIGHTTIME AND MY FAMILY HAD GONE TO BED AND I STOOD AT THE WINDOW LISTENING TO ??MORE THAN A WOMAN? AND I ADMIT I GOT ALL TEARY-EYED IN THE SAME WAY I HAD IN GYM CLASS ON THAT DAY LONG AGO WHEN I DANCED WITH TAMMI EVANS. IN PROUST??S REMEMBRANCE OF THINGS PAST THE NARRATOR UNLOCKS A FLOOD OF MEMORIES WHEN HE BITES INTO A MADELEINE THE FLAVOR REMINDING HIM OF CHILDHOOD DAYS WHEN HE HAD EATEN THE SAME TREAT AT HIS FAMILY??S COTTAGE IN THE FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE. A TWO THOUSAND-PAGE NOVEL ENSUES. I WASN??T GOING THAT FAR. BUT I HAD FOUND MY MADELEINE.?Ÿ DURING THE DAY FUELED BY MY NEWLY DISCOVERED NOSTALGIA FOR DISCO THE PAGES OF THE NOVEL ACCUMULATED RAPIDLY. IN THE EARLY MORNING OR LATE AT NIGHT WHEN I HAD THE HOUSE TO MYSELF I READ PROUST WITH THE RECORD PLAYER ON. WHILE PROUST DESCRIBED THE GIRLS ON THE BEACH AT BALBEC ALICIA BRIDGES SANG ABOUT HOW MUCH SHE LOVED THE NIGHT LIFE. WHILE THE FICTIONAL MARCEL SCHEMED TO HOLD THE ELUSIVE ALBERTINE CAPTIVE IN HIS PARIS APARTMENT ANITA WARD REMINDED ME THAT I COULD ALWAYS RING HER BELL. THE MUSIC??THE SAME MUSIC THAT I HAD PRETENDED TO HATE AND TRIED TO IGNORE AND LEFT BEHIND FORGOTTEN??NOW NOT ONLY SEEMED APPEALING AND FRESH TO ME BUT THREW OPEN WINDOWS ON MY PAST SO THAT I COULD FEEL AGAIN EVEN IF ONLY FOR A MOMENT LIKE I DID WHEN I WAS ASSIGNED THE PERFECT DANCE PARTNER THAT DAY IN GYM CLASS. AND IN RECAPTURING THOSE MOMENTS I GAINED ENTRY INTO THOSE SAME FEELINGS ON THE PART OF MY CHARACTERS AN EMOTIONAL LEVEL THAT I WASN??T REACHING BEFORE. CHARACTERS HAVE PAST JOYS AND REGRETS JUST LIKE REAL PEOPLE DO AND DISCOVERING THEM SOMETIMES MEANS RELIVING YOUR OWN PAST??NOT THE INCIDENTS SO MUCH BUT THE FEELINGS EVOKED BY THEM. MY OLDEST SON IS A MUSICIAN??HE CREATES ELECTRONIC MUSIC AND MAKES HIP-HOP BEATS??AND I WAS DISCUSSING WITH HIM RECENTLY IN VERY GENERAL TERMS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MUSIC ??NOW? AND THE MUSIC ??THEN.? I MENTIONED HOW HE AND MY YOUNGER SON WOULD LISTEN TO A SONG FOR A DAY OR TWO AND THEN I WOULD NEVER HEAR IT AGAIN. I LAMENTED THE FACT THAT ALL THE NEW MUSIC SEEMED DISPOSABLE??EXISTING IN THE ETHER FOR ONLY A NANOSECOND NEVER EVEN ACHIEVING A PHYSICAL FORM LIKE THE ALBUMS I COULD PICK UP AND PUT ON THE RECORD PLAYER MUCH LESS THE ENDURING FORM OF MEMORIES. HE SAID BASICALLY THAT I WAS OLD AND I WAS MISSING THE POINT??THE MUSIC WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DISPOSABLE. THERE WAS SO MUCH OUT THERE THAT YOU COULD ALWAYS MOVE ON TO SOMETHING NEW. WHY LISTEN TO THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN? I HAD BEEN FOOLED BY THE WESTERN MUSICAL TRADITION INTO BELIEVING THERE WAS SUCH A THING AS A ??TIMELESS CLASSIC.? TOUCHE I SAID AND CUED UP A HOT CHOCOLATE ALBUM I??D JUST FOUND IN THE DOLLAR BIN THE ONE FEATURING ??YOU SEXY THING? AND I DISAPPEARED IN A SWIRLING FOG OF DRY ICE INTO 1978. DAVID BOWIE GLENN FREY ROBERT STIGWOOD??THEY??RE ALL GONE NOW AND THE ??70S WERE A LONG TIME AGO BUT FOR ME AND OTHERS OF MY GENERATION THEY STAY VIVID AND NEAR. MAYBE MEMORY IS OUR BEST COMPENSATION FOR GROWING OLD. I??M PAST THE HALF-CENTURY MARK NOW AND I KNOW A THING OR TWO ABOUT GETTING OLDER ALTHOUGH AS MY FATHER WHO ALSO PASSED AWAY RECENTLY USED TO TELL ME THERE ARE A FEW THINGS I DON??T KNOW YET. I MIGHT NOT BE IN TUNE TO EVERYTHING NEW BUT I??VE GOT A LIFETIME OF MEMORIES TO DRAW ON WHEN I NEED A BOOST. MAYBE THAT??S WHAT ART IS ALL ABOUT: IT OFFERS SOMETHING SUSTAINING AND YES PERMANENT??AT LEAST IN THE MIND OF THE ONE WHO STORES IT UP AND TREASURES IT??THAT WE CARRY WITH US AS OUR LIVES MOVE FORWARD. OUR TIME GROWS SHORTER BUT OUR MEMORIES ARE LONG. IN OTHER WORDS THE BEE GEES HAVE MY BACK. MAYBE THERE??S A VERSION OF THEM FOR ALL OF US WAITING THERE IN THE WINGS OF OUR MEMORY IN SOME HIDDEN CORNER OF OUR PAST EARNEST AND HOPEFUL AND EAGER TO PLEASE READY TO COME TO OUR RESCUE IF WE??LL ONLY LET THEM.

PETERSBURG HOME OF ANNA PAVLOVNA PLAYED TO SNOBBISH PERFECTION BY GILLIAN ANDERSON. THIS BEING A BRITISH BROADCASTING COMPANY COSTUME DRAMA IN THE GRANDEST OF BBC TRADITIONS THE COSTUMES NATURALLY HAVE A STARRING ROLE??AND NEVER MORE SO THAN IN THESE OPENING MINUTES.

SO GRAB A CUP OF TEA RELAX AND SETTLE IN FOR SIX-PLUS HOURS OF PURE HISTORICAL ESCAPISM. AS IN THE BOOK THE KEY THEMES OF THE STORY ARE QUICKLY INTRODUCED. ONE OF THE GREAT PROBLEMS OF READING WAR AND PEACE (A TASK I UNDERTOOK AT SCHOOL AND RECENTLY REVISITED ON AUDIOBOOK IN THE CAR) IS THE RUSSIAN NAMES WHICH ARE VERY CONFUSING SINCE EVERYONE HAS SEVERAL DIFFERENT NAMES (OR PATRONYMS CORRUPTIONS AND DIMINUTIVES OF ONE??S FATHER??S NAME) BY WHICH THEY ARE REFERRED TO BY OTHERS DEPENDING ON THEIR RANK AND FAMILIARITY WITH THE PERSON THEY ARE SPEAKING WITH. WONDERFULLY THIS BBC ADAPTATION DOES AWAY WITH ALL THAT MAKING IT RELATIVELY SIMPLE TO FIGURE OUT WHO IS WHO. IN ESSENCE THE KEY PLOT POINTS TO UNDERSTAND FROM LAST NIGHT ARE THAT SCHEMING PRINCE VASSILY KURAGIN (A WORLDLY STEPHEN REA) WANTS HIS DAUGHTER H??L??NE AND SON ANATOLE MARRIED OFF. ILLEGITIMATE PIERRE BEZUKHOV (PAUL DANO) A SOCIAL KLUTZ AND HEAVY-DRINKING YOUTH UNEXPECTEDLY BECOMES ONE OF THE RICHEST MEN IN RUSSIA WHEN HIS FATHER THE DYING COUNT BEZUKHOV RECOGNISES HIM AS LEGITIMATE ON HIS DEATHBED TRANSFORMING PIERRE FROM LOCAL LAUGHINGSTOCK INTO VASSILY??S PRIME MARRIAGE TARGET FOR HIS H??L??NE. BUT PIERRE IS IN LOVE WITH NATASHA (LILY JAMES) THE BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER OF IMPOVERISHED ARISTOCRATS (DAVIES WISELY IGNORES THE FACT THAT SHE IS AHEM 12 IN THE OPENING OF TOLSTOY??S BOOK AND PIERRE IS CLEARLY A WOMANIZING TWENTY-SOMETHING). PIERRE IS WEAK HOWEVER AND BY THE END OF LAST NIGHT??S FIRST INSTALLMENT HAD BEEN RAILROADED INTO MARRIAGE WITH H??L??NE WHO IS VERY BEAUTIFUL AND VERY DAMAGED. TOLSTOY LETS US KNOW SHE IS NOT A PARTICULARLY GOOD EGG VIA A SERIES OF SUBTLE HINTS AND PROMPTS BUT SCREENWRITER ANDREW DAVIES HAS A BETTER IDEA: HE SHOWS HER BROTHER STRIPPING OFF AND CLIMBING INTO BED WITH HER IN THE OPENING MINUTES. JUST IN CASE YOU MISS IT HE REFERS TO HER AS ??SISTER? WHILE PREPARING TO MAKE LOVE TO HER (THE SEX ITSELF IS MERCIFULLY NOT SHOWN). THERE??S MORE SEX LATER WHEN H??L??NE EMBARKS ON ANOTHER AFFAIR WITH ONE OF HER HUSBAND?? PALS ON THE DINING ROOM TABLE. THERE??S CRUSHED FRUIT EVERYWHERE. IT??S TERRIBLY BBC. THE INCEST HAS BEEN THE CAUSE OF SOME CONTROVERSY IN THE U.K. WHERE WE ARE A FEW EPISODES AHEAD OF THE U.S. OF COURSE A FEW SENSATIONAL HEADLINES ABOUT INCEST NEVER HURT RATINGS (SEE: GAME OF THRONES) BUT THIS VIEWER AT LEAST FOUND IT UNPROBLEMATIC. DAVIS IS QUITE RIGHT WHEN HE ARGUES THAT THE INCESTUOUS AFFAIR??WHICH IS PRESENTED AS RUMOR IN THE BOOK??NEEDS TO BE SHOWN EXPLICITLY IN A MODERN SCREEN ADAPTATION OF THE NOVEL. AS CATRIONA KELLY PROFESSOR OF RUSSIAN AT THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD TOLD THE DAILY BEAST ??ANDREW DAVIES ISN??T MAKING IT UP. TOLSTOY HAS PIERRE DOUBTING WHETHER HE SHOULD MARRY H??L??NE KURAGIN BECAUSE OF THE RUMORS SHE IS IN LOVE WITH HER BROTHER AND HE WITH HIM.? THE TROUBLE WITH WAR AND PEACE AS A BOOK IS THAT ALTHOUGH IT IS VERY GOOD AND A GENUINE PAGE-TURNER IN PLACES IN OTHERS IT IS ALMOST UNREADABLE. ADDING TO THE AFOREMENTIONED ISSUE THAT EVERYONE IS REFERRED TO BY A DIFFERENT NAME EVERY FIVE MINUTES THERE ARE PAGES AND PAGES AND YET MORE INTERMINABLE PAGES DEVOTED TO THE DESCRIPTION OF THE MOST FAMOUS BATTLES OF THE NAPOLEONIC WARS. (??WE ADVANCED ON THE LEFT FLANK. THE FRENCH DREW TO A HALT ON THE SMALL GRASSY HILL ABOVE THE TOWN ETC ETC???) THEN ONCE THE BATTLE SEQUENCE IS OVER THERE WILL BE A TWENTY-PAGE ESSAY ON THE UNRELIABILITY OF CONVENTIONAL HISTORIANS A SORT OF FIT OF TOLSTOYIAN PIQUE IN WHICH THE GREAT AUTHOR EXPOUNDS AT LENGTH ON HOW THEY HAVE ALL MISUNDERSTOOD THE STRUCTURE AND PROGRESS OF RUSSIA??S WAR AGAINST NAPOLEON FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER DIATRIBE ON FOR EXAMPLE HOW THE BATTLE PLANS OF MILITARY GENERALS ARE NEVER AND CAN NEVER BE PROPERLY FOLLOWED BY AN ARMY IN THE HEAT OF BATTLE AND THAT THE ONLY WISE GENERALS ARE THE ONES WHO UNDERSTAND THIS. AT THE RISK OF STATING THE OBVIOUS WAR AND PEACE THE NOVEL DOES GO ON A BIT. SO IT??S A CREDIT TO THIS NEW ADAPTATION IF IT ALL FEELS LIKE IT??S HAPPENING A BIT TOO QUICKLY.

DEPLOYING IT NOW AT THE START OF HIS FINAL YEAR AND IN THE MIDST OF BOTH A FULL-ON RIGHT WING REBELLION AND A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN WILL BE A MONUMENTAL CHALLENGE. CAN THE PRESIDENT MAKE THE MORAL CASE FOR IMMIGRATION REFORM WHILE ADDRESSING THE DEMOGRAPHIC PANIC THE EXTREMISTS ON THE RIGHT ARE PUSHING BUT THAT MANY RUN-OF-THE-MILL AMERICANS FEEL A SMIDGEON OF TOO? CAN HE CALL FOR A REVIVAL OF RACIAL TOLERANCE WHILE NOT LUMPING TOGETHER REGULAR FOLKS WHO GET IRRITATED AT HAVING TO ??PRESS ONE FOR ENGLISH? WITH THE TRUMP RALLY GOONS AND SOCIAL MEDIA TROLLS? AND CAN HE ASSUAGE AVERAGE AMERICANS?? NERVOUSNESS ABOUT TAKING IN SYRIAN REFUGEES AND SIMULTANEOUSLY ADDRESS THE ALARMING SURGE IN ISLAMOPHOBIA AND RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE IN THIS COUNTRY? IF HE CAN THE PRESIDENT WILL CARRY A WORKING MAJORITY HOWEVER IMPERFECT INTO THE COMING IDEOLOGICAL WARS WITH THE FAR RIGHT. IF HE CAN??T IT??S GOING TO BE A VERY LONG YEAR. OBAMA WAS ELECTED AT A HISTORICAL BREAKING POINT OF RACE IDEOLOGY AND ECONOMIC HAVES AND HAVE-NOTS. NOW HE HAS ONE MORE YEAR TO DECIDE WHETHER THE NEW AMERICA HE LEADS AND SYMBOLIZES CAN AND SHOULD FIND D??TENTE WITH THE OLD AMERICA OR SIMPLY TRY TO VANQUISH ITS MOST PERNICIOUS GENERALS AND FORCE THEIR INFURIATED TROOPS TO FACE THE FUTURE.?Ÿ ON GUN SAFETY AND IMMIGRATION THE PRESIDENT HAS TRIED BOTH APPROACHES FIRST NEGOTIATING WITH THE OTHER SIDE THEN AFTER REALIZING THAT NEGOTIATION IS FUTILE IN THE FACE OF ALMOST RELIGIOUS GUN WORSHIP AND ANTI-GOVERNMENT PARANOIA AND AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF PURE DEMOGRAPHIC PANIC TURNING TO EXECUTIVE POWER INSTEAD. DEMOCRATS DID MUCH THE SAME WITH HEALTHCARE NEGOTIATING FIRST AND THEN USING THE POWER OF THEIR MAJORITY TO FORCE THE GAME. THE PRESIDENT WILL LIKELY DOUBLE DOWN ON TUESDAY IN TOUTING THE RESULTS: 16 MILLION MORE AMERICANS WITH HEALTHCARE AND NO ALTERNATIVE ON OFFER FROM THOSE VOWING AND REPEATEDLY VOTING TO TAKE IT FROM THEM.?Ÿ OBAMA HAS PRESIDED OVER SWEEPING CULTURAL ADVANCES PARTICULARLY IN THE RIGHTS OF GAY AND LESBIAN AMERICANS. THE TURNABOUT ON THESE ISSUES HAS BEEN SWIFT INCLUDING IN THE GROWING PUBLIC SYMPATHY FOR TRANSGENDER PEOPLES?? STRUGGLES FOR A DIGNIFIED EXISTENCE NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN IN THE MILITARY AND IN A MUCH BELATED RECOGNITION THAT THERE IS SOMETHING DEEPLY WRONG WITH THE WAY OUR POLICE DEPARTMENTS FUNCTION IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR.?Ÿ BUT BUILDING ON THOSE VICTORIES DEPENDS HEAVILY ON DEMOCRATS MAINTAINING THE WHITE HOUSE. AND THE GROWING FEROCITY AND TENACITY OF THE FORCES THAT LAUNCHED THE LUNCH PAIL REVOLUTION HAVE SHOWN NO SIGNS OF BACKING DOWN. IN FACT FAR FROM BEING SILENCED BY THE BULLYING JACKBOOT OF LIBERAL THOUGHT POLICE THE FAR RIGHT??S VOICES HAVE BEEN HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR FOR DECADES. THE IRONY OF THEIR CURRENT RAGE IS THAT FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS WHETHER ON TAX CUTS FOR THE RICH CURBING PUBLIC ASSISTANCE TO THE POOR OR ROLLING BACK THE VOTING RIGHTS ADVANCES OF THE 1960S THEY??VE LARGELY GOTTEN THEIR WAY.?Ÿ EVEN AT ITS MOST OUTRAGEOUS EARLY MOMENTS THE TEA PARTY MOVEMENT WAS TREATED TO SOBER AND AT TIMES BREATHLESS MEDIA COVERAGE TO THE POINT OF BEING INVITED TO CO-HOST A PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE. BELTWAY SOLICITUDE TOWARD THE RIGHT HAS IN FACT BECOME SO PERVASIVE THAT THE MAINSTREAM PRESS CANNOT BRING ITSELF TO DESCRIBE AN ARMED GANG OCCUPYING FEDERAL PROPERTY IN OREGON RECORDING MARTYRDOM VIDEOS AND DECLARING THEY ARE WILLING TO DIE TO FORCE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO HAND OVER PUBLIC LANDS TO WHOMEVER THEY DESIGNATE AS ANYTHING MORE THAN ??PROTESTERS.? THIS AS BLACK LIVES MATTER ACTIVISTS ARE PUBLICLY DENOUNCED AS ??TERRORISTS? FOR THEIR ACTS OF UNARMED PROTEST AGAINST THE RAMPANT USE OF DEADLY FORCE AGAINST MEN WOMEN AND 12-YEAR-OLD BOYS. INDEED ON MATTERS OF RACE AND POLICING SOME 40 YEARS OF CULTURAL NORMS HAVE BEEN SHATTERED WHEN IT COMES TO THE OPEN DENIGRATION OF PEOPLE OF COLOR UP TO AND INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. FAR FROM BEING SILENCED THE FAR RIGHT HAS NEVER SEEMED MORE EMPOWERED. CONSERVATIVES HAVE CREATED A CLIMATE IN WHICH REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS CANNOT ACCEPT FEDERAL MONEY TO COVER THEIR OWN POOR EVEN WITH A 100 PERCENT FEDERAL MATCH UNDER MEDICAID LEAVING MORE THAN 4 MILLION RED STATE CITIZENS UNCOVERED. THEY HAVE DRIVEN THEIR CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVES TO MOUNT USELESS VOTE AFTER USELESS VOTE TO TRY AND STRIP AWAY THE HEALTHCARE LAW FOR EVERYONE EVEN TO THE POINT OF SHUTTING DOWN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. A YEAR AGO BACKED BY A MEDIA INFRASTRUCTURE FAR MORE POWERFUL THAN ANY COUNTERPART ON THE LEFT SOME OF THE SAME PEOPLE NOW OCCUPYING FEDERAL LAND IN OREGON GOT AWAY WITH SHOOING OFF FEDERAL AGENTS AND MAKING THE BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT WALK AWAY FROM $1 MILLION IN OVERDUE LAND GRAZING FEES BY POINTING ASSAULT RIFLES AT FEDERAL AGENTS.?ŸAND IN JUST THE PAST YEAR THE FAR RIGHT STAGED A TAKEOVER OF ONE OF THE COUNTRY??S TWO MAJOR POLITICAL PARTIES DEPOSED THE HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER AND NEARLY TOOK DOWN THE SPEAKER BEFORE HE SCURRIED AWAY SHIELDED BY THE VISITING POPE.?Ÿ LATELY THOUGH THE WORKING CLASS VOTERS WHO PRODUCED THESE RESULTS HAVE FIGURED OUT THAT THE REWARD FOR THEIR ZEAL AND LOYALTY HAS BEEN MEAGER IN TERMS OF THEIR OWN JOB PROSPECTS AND POCKETBOOKS.

FOR INSTANCE JUST AS DINERS LEARN CHAMPAGNE ISN??T ONLY A ??SOMETIMES DRINK\ THEY??RE ALSO DISCOVERING THE PARTICULAR PLEASURES OF BOURBON DURING DINNER. WHILE MANY PEOPLE MAY SAVOR A BOURBON OLD FASHIONED OR MINT JULEP WITH BARBECUED RIBS AND PULLED PORK THE FACT IS THE ICONIC AMERICAN WHISKEY IS COMPLEX AND VARIED ENOUGH TO LEND ITSELF TO SIPPING ALONGSIDE A WIDE VARIETY OF DISHES. WE HAVE AN ENTIRE SECTION DEDICATED TO BOURBON COCKTAILS? SAYS CHEF AND OWNER EDWARD LEE. THE FOUNDER OF TWO INNOVATIVE RESTAURANTS IN LOUISVILLE KENTUCKY LEE EXCELS AT MARRYING HIS BROOKLYN-BASED KOREAN-AMERICAN HERITAGE WITH HIS LOVE FOR SOUTHERN CUISINE. THE FRENCH-TRAINED LEE HAS RESEARCHED SOUTHERN COOKING DEEPLY UPDATED IT AND INFLECTED IT WITH EAST ASIAN INGREDIENTS AND TECHNIQUES. ??I??VE ALWAYS BEEN VERY SKEPTICAL TO THE POINT OF WHERE I CALL BS ON THE IDEA OF ONLY PAIRING ASIAN FOODS WITH RIESLING? SAYS LEE. AS WITH SOUTHERN COOKING KOREAN FOOD CELEBRATES CHAR SPICES AND GRILLED MEATS. ??WHEN I CAME UPON BOURBON IT DREW ME INTO THE DISCUSSION. WHETHER YOU??RE TALKING KOREAN KALBI (SHORT RIBS) OR JAPANESE YAKITORI THERE??S NOTHING BETTER THAN BOURBON.? A LITTLE PRIMER: BOURBON MAY BE CALLED ??BOURBON? ONLY IF IT??S MADE IN THE U.S. CONTAINS AT LEAST 51% CORN IN ITS GRAIN MASH MEETS CERTAIN DISTILLATION REQUIREMENTS AND IS AGED IN NEW CHARRED OAK BARRELS. A RELATIVELY ??LOW? PROOF OFF THE STILL (NO MORE THAN 62.5% ABV OR 125 PROOF) GIVES BOURBON MORE DEPTH AND CHARACTER THAN MOST VODKAS OR ??MOONSHINES.? TIME SPENT IN CHARRED NEW OAK (THE LEVEL OF CHAR MAY VARY FROM LIGHT TO VERY DARK) IMPARTS NOTES OF CARAMEL VANILLA AND OTHER FLAVORS. THE REST OF THE ??MASH? (THE GRAIN COMBINATION THAT WITH WATER AND YEAST WILL FERMENT INTO ALCOHOL) CAN BE MOST ANY FERMENTABLE GRAIN BUT IS GENERALLY WHEAT OR RYE (ALONG WITH A COMPONENT OF MALTED BARLEY). IT??S THE RATIOS AND TYPES OF GRAINS THAT IMPART OVERALL FLAVOR PROFILES TO SPECIFIC WHISKEYS. ??WHEATED? BOURBONS RUN A LITTLE SWEETER ON THE PALATE WHILE ??HIGH RYES? LIKE WOODFORD RESERVE DEVELOP ELEMENTS OF SPICE PEPPER AND TROPICAL FRUITS. WOODFORD??S ??MASH BILL? OF ROUGHLY 72% CORN 18% RYE AND 10% MALT IMPARTS DISTINCTIVE FLAVOR AND AROMATIC NOTES THAT DISTINGUISH IT FROM OTHER BRANDS AND EXPRESSIONS. MORE RECENTLY BOURBON PRODUCERS HAVE BEGUN EXPERIMENTING WITH OTHER ELEMENTS ALLOWED WITHIN THE SPIRIT??S FAIRLY RIGID PARAMETERS. WOODFORD RESERVE MASTER DISTILLER CHRIS MORRIS INTRODUCED THE DOUBLE OAKED EXPRESSION IN 2012 (BOURBON IS THEN RACKED INTO ??TOASTED? BARRELS FOR A SECOND ROUND OF AGING AND MELLOWING) AND THE ANNUAL MASTER??S COLLECTION EXPLORES DIFFERENT SECONDARY GRAINS OR UNIQUE BARREL ??FINISHES.? EACH EXPRESSION ADDS NEW LAYERS OF COMPLEXITY. AS WITH FOOD THE SIGNATURE COCKTAIL MENU AT ONE CHEF LEE??S RESTAURANTS IS INSPIRED BY THE TASTING ??ZONES? OF THE TONGUE (SWEET SALTY SOUR BITTER AND UMAMI) WITH UNUSUAL MIXERS LIKE BRINE GENTIAN (AN EXCEEDINGLY BITTER ROOT) HONEY CIDER AND EVEN PEANUT BUTTER DRAWING BROWN SPIRITS ALONG UNEXPLORED PATHS. THESE UNCTUOUS FLAVORS WORK NICELY WITH A MENU THAT INCLUDES SHELLFISH AND DUCK PURLOO OVER DELTA GRITS OR THE MW CHILI DOG FEATURING A SMOKED NORI SAUSAGE AND SHARP CHEDDAR CHEESE. MEANWHILE AT HIS OTHER RESTAURANT CHEF LEE AND HIS STAFF OFFER COCKTAILS AS PART OF THE FOUR-COURSE FIXED PRICE MEAL THAT CHANGES EVERY TWO OR THREE WEEKS. ??WE USED TO CALL IT A WINE PAIRING NOW WE CALL IT A BEVERAGE PAIRING. SOME DISHES PAIR BETTER WITH WINE SOME WITH APPLE CIDER SOME WITH BRANDY. AND WE ALWAYS DO A BOURBON WITH A COURSE BECAUSE WE??RE IN BOURBON COUNTRY.? TWEAKING TRADITIONAL COCKTAILS ALSO LEADS TO UNIQUE FOOD PAIRINGS. A LITTLE LEMON JUICE IN A MINT JULEP TIGHTENS THE DRINK TO PAIR WITH FATTY MEATS. A HALF-OUNCE OF PEACH BRANDY AND PEACH GARNISH ADDS EARTHY FRUIT NOTES IDEALLY SUITED FOR CHEESES DRIED FRUITS AND NUTS. UPGRADE A WHISKEY SOUR WITH A SHOT OF BLACK TEA TO PAIR WITH SALTY FISH OR RAMEN DISHES. MORRIS WOODFORD??S DISTILLER AGREES HIS WHISKEY GOES WELL WITH A VARIETY OF DISHES: ??MY FAVORITES INCLUDE BEEF WITH CITRUS OR BERRY FRUIT GLAZES OR CHUTNEYS? HE SAYS. FOR LEE WHO CONTINUOUSLY EXPERIMENTS WITH NEW FLAVORS AND PAIRINGS THERE HAVE BEEN SURPRISES. \""WE DO A CLASSIC PORK SHOULDER COOKED IN A SOUTHERN WAY BUT TOPPED WITH A CHINESE-STYLE FERMENTED BLACK BEAN SAUCE INSTEAD OF KETCHUP\"" LEE EXPLAINS. \""WE PAIR IT WITH A DRINK WE CALL SMOKE AND PICKLE. WE MIX BOURBON WITH A LITTLE PICKLE JUICE AND A COUPLE OF OTHER INGREDIENTS.

SINCE 2006 VIOLENCE IN MEXICO HAS FOLLOWED A CURIOUS GEOGRAPHIC PROGRESSION. AFTER MICHOAC?­N CAME THE STATES OF TAMAULIPAS COAHUILA AND NUEVO LE??N WHERE THE FIGHT BETWEEN MEXICAN FORCES THE ZETAS AND THE REMNANTS OF THE GULF CARTEL TURNED MEXICO??S NORTHEAST INTO A WAR ZONE. VIOLENCE HAS NOW MOVED SOUTHWEST ALONGSIDE MEXICO??S PACIFIC COAST. FIRST CAME GUERRERO WHERE LOCAL CARTELS HAVE SWALLOWED ENTIRE TOWNS CORRUPTING LOCAL AUTHORITIES OFTEN WITH SICKENING CONSEQUENCES. THE LATEST EPICENTER OF MEXICAN VIOLENCE IS MORELOS A STATE OF 1.8 MILLION PEOPLE WHICH BORDERS MEXICO CITY. IT??S A BEAUTIFUL PLACE. ITS CAPITAL CUERNAVACA IS KNOWN AS ??THE CITY OF ETERNAL SPRING.? NOVELIST MALCOLM LOWRY LOVED IT AS DID WELL MOBSTER SAM GIANCANA.

THE FATE OF A RECENTLY ELECTED MAYOR ILLUSTRATES THE STATE??S??AND THE COUNTRY??S??CURRENT PREDICAMENT. THE TOWN OF TEMIXCO LIES JUST SOUTH OF CUERNAVACA. LIKE MOST OF MORELOS IT HAS BECOME A BATTLEGROUND BETWEEN TWO SMALL BUT BRUTAL CARTELS LOS ROJOS AND GUERREROS UNIDOS. BOTH SPUN FROM LARGER GROUPS LOS ROJOS FROM THE GULF CARTEL AND GUERREROS UNIDOS FROM THE BELTRAN LEYVA ORGANIZATION. FOR AT LEAST THREE YEARS THESE GANGS HAVE TRIED TO GAIN A FOOTHOLD IN MORELOS A STATE OF CRUCIAL GEOGRAPHICAL IMPORTANCE SINCE AMONG OTHER THINGS IT CONNECTS THE COUNTRY??S CAPITAL TO DRUG PRODUCERS AND DISTRIBUTORS ALONG THE COAST. IN THIS CONTEXT THE REGION??S LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE BECOME PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE. EVEN THE PRESUMPTION OF ALLEGIANCE CAN CARRY THE ULTIMATE COST. THIS APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN THE CASE FOR GISELA MOTA THE FIRST WOMAN TO BE ELECTED MAYOR OF TEMIXCO. MOTA SEEMED TO BE IN HIGH SPIRITS DURING A NEW YEAR??S DAY INTERVIEW. WEARING HEAVY MAKE-UP AND A STRIKING RED DRESS SHE TOUTED TEMIXCO??S MANY TOURIST ATTRACTIONS (LIKE THE GORGEOUS XVITH CENTURY HACIENDA ONCE OWNED BY MARTIN CORTES SON OF HERN?­N) AND PROMISED TO REDUCE THE TOWN??S HEAVY DEBT.

JOURNALIST H??CTOR DE MAULE??N WHO HAS FOLLOWED THE STORY CLOSELY POINTS TO A REPORT BY STATE OFFICIALS: MEMBERS OF LOS ROJOS ASSUMED MOTA HAD STRUCK A DEAL WITH A GROUP OF PETTY DRUG DEALERS FROM GUERREROS UNIDOS.

A RECENT STUDY FOUND THAT AT LEAST DURING THE LAST FIVE YEARS DRUG CARTELS HAVE FOCUSED THEIR EFFORTS IN SUBVERTING THE RULE OF LAW NOT ON THE STATE OR FEDERAL STRATA BUT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL PRECISELY IN TOWNS GOVERNED BY PEOPLE LIKE MARIA SANTOS GORROSTIETA OR GISELA MOTA.

IF WE FOLLOWED WINTOUR MEETING DESIGNERS AND PERCEIVED THE GLAMOROUS WHIRL OF THE PUBLIC FIGURE FAR MORE INTRIGUING WAS CODDINGTON??WRY AND STOIC AMID THE RAILS OF CLOTHES IN VOGUE??S CORRIDORS HER DEDICATION TO THE ARTISTIC PURSUIT OF WHAT HER DAY JOB WAS AND THE FRUSTRATION AND VERY VISIBLE PAIN WHEN HER CREATIVE WISHES WERE STYMIED. CODDINGTON 74 TOLD BUSINESS OF FASHION TODAY ??I REALLY LOVE VOGUE IT??S BEEN IN MY LIFE ALWAYS THEY DISCOVERED ME AS A MODEL AT 19. I??M NOT RUNNING AWAY FROM VOGUE BECAUSE IT HAS OPENED SO MANY DOORS. BUT IT WILL BE NICE TO COLLABORATE AND NICE TO GO OUT [AND] GIVE TALKS TO PEOPLE. IT??S JUST ANOTHER APPROACH. I??M CERTAINLY NOT GOING INTO RETIREMENT. I DON??T WANT TO SIT AROUND.? AS THE SEPTEMBER ISSUE CRYSTALLIZED CODDINGTON??WITH HER ETHEREAL CLOUD OF RED HAIR AND FINE FEATURES??HAS BECOME A BRAND HERSELF. PERHAPS HER DEPARTURE FROM VOGUE IS THE BEST KIND OF KARMIC RESULT OF THE FAME SHE HAS ACCRUED. CODDINGTON??S LONGEVITY IS BOTH INSTRUCTIVE AND INSPIRATIONAL. FASHION IN GENERAL AND HIGH FASHION IN PARTICULAR MAY SEEM SHALLOW AND OVERPRICED AND THE INDUSTRY AND HYPE THAT SWIRLS AROUND IT ABSURD AND DETACHED FROM MOST PEOPLE??S LIVES. CODDINGTON HOWEVER SEEMED A VERY ROOTED HUMAN PRESENCE IN THIS HIGH-PRESSURED WORLD. CODDINGTON STARTED READING VOGUE AS A TEENAGER WHICH SHE RECALLED IN THE SEPTEMBER ISSUE AS A ??CHIC THING? TOTALLY ??OUT OF CONTEXT? FOR THE NON-METROPOLITAN LIFE SHE LIVED IN NORTH WALES. ??EVERYTHING I DID I FELL INTO? SHE SAID REMEMBERING WINNING A VOGUE MODELING COMPETITION AND HEADING TO LONDON. WE SAW HER GAMINE-BEAUTIFUL PHOTOGRAPHED BY LORD SNOWDON IN 1959. SHE STOPPED MODELING AFTER A CAR CRASH. HER EYE WAS SMASHED INTO THE DRIVING MIRROR AND SHE HAD TO HAVE A LOT OF PLASTIC SURGERY. TWO YEARS LATER SHE WENT BACK TO WORK AS A JUNIOR EDITOR AT BRITISH VOGUE. CODDINGTON??S AURA OF POWER MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM WINTOUR??S BUT THE FASCINATION WITH HER AND THE RESPECT FOR HER WORK IS AS RESONANT AS IT IS FOR THE VOGUE EDITOR-IN-CHIEF. IT IS SIGNIFICANT IN ITSELF THAT CODDINGTON IS NOW REPRESENTED BY GREAT BOWERY A ??SUPER-AGENCY? FOR HIGH-POWERED CREATIVE FORCES LIKE ANNIE LEIBOVITZ AND BRUCE WEBER. CODDINGTON??FOR SO LONG THE BACKSTAGE CINDERELLA--HAS BECOME AS FAMOUS AND OVERTLY INFLUENTIAL AS THOSE PHOTOGRAPHERS AND DESIGNERS WHOSE WORK SHE LAID OUT IN THE PAGES OF VOGUE. ??I SUDDENLY REALIZED THAT I NEEDED SOME HELP FROM OUTSIDE? CODDINGTON TOLD BOF. ??I DIDN??T WANT TO BE PIGEONHOLED INTO JUST STYLING A SHOOT I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING BEYOND. I APPROACHED THEM AND THEY WERE WILLING TO HELP ME ON ALL SORTS OF ASPECTS. THEY??RE THINKING UP IDEAS FOR ME WHICH IS FUN.? MATTHEW MONEYPENNY GREAT BOWERY??S CHIEF EXECUTIVE TOLD BOF: \WE ARE EXTREMELY HONORED TO HAVE GRACE CODDINGTON JOIN GREAT BOWERY AND LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING AND WORKING WITH ONE OF THE MOST ORIGINAL ICONIC AND DEEPLY CREATIVE FIGURES IN THE FASHION WORLD. I'M SURE IT COMES AS NO SURPRISE THAT WE ARE ALREADY RECEIVING VERY SIGNIFICANT AND INTERESTING INQUIRIES WHICH WE LOOK FORWARD TO EXPLORING.? TO ADD TO HER AUTOBIOGRAPHY PUBLISHED IN 2012 AND ALREADY OPTIONED FOR A MOVIE CODDINGTON IS ALSO WORKING ON A PERFUME WITH COMME DES GAR??ONS AND POSSIBLY AN ANIMATED FILM FROM HER ??CATWALK CATS?? ILLUSTRATION SERIES. IN THE FALL PHAIDON WILL PUBLISH A BOOK OF HER WORK FOR AMERICAN VOGUE SPANNING THE LAST 15 YEARS. CODDINGTON TOLD THE SEPTEMBER ISSUE THAT SHE HAD ??NEVER DREAMT? SHE COULD BE A MODEL OR FASHION EDITOR BUT SHE HAD ??JUST LOVED? PAGES AND PICTURES. IN HER EARLY YEARS AS A FASHION EDITOR THE PHOTOGRAPHER NORMAN PARKINSON HAD TAUGHT CODDINGTON ??TO ALWAYS KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN NEVER GO TO SLEEP IN THE CAR KEEP WATCHING WHATEVER YOU SEE OUT OF THE WINDOW.? SHE RECALLED THIS SURVEYING THE MAJESTIC GARDENS OF VERSAILLES REMARKING HOW BEAUTIFUL THEY WERE AND HOW STRANGE TO THINK HOW OLD THEY WERE TOO. ??I THINK I GOT LEFT BEHIND SOMEWHERE BECAUSE I??M STILL A ROMANTIC? CODDINGTON SAID SMILING BEFORE REMEMBERING THE BUSINESS SHE WAS IMMERSED IN. ??YOU HAVE TO GO CHARGING AHEAD. YOU CAN??T STAY BEHIND.? PERHAPS THERE IS A GRAINIER PART OF HER VOGUE PARTIAL-DEPARTURE STORY YET TO EMERGE. DURING THE SEPTEMBER ISSUE CODDINGTON??S FRUSTRATION AND UPSET AT THE SPIKING OF SPREADS WERE AS EVIDENT AS HER PASSION AND LOVE FOR FASHION. CONSOLING A COLLEAGUE AFTER WINTOUR HAD REJECTED HIS CHOICES FOR A PIECE ON COLOR BLOCKING CODDINGTON CAUTIONED: ??YOU??VE GOT TO BE TOUGHER. YOU HAVE TO DEMAND BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU??LL BE BLAMED. DON'T BE TOO NICE EVEN TO ME. HONESTLY YOU??LL LOSE. YOU HAVE TO LEARN A WAY TO BEAT THE PATH THROUGH TO MAKE YOURSELF FELT AND MAKE YOURSELF NECESSARY AND FIND WAY THAT WORKS FOR YOU FOR VOGUE.? OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAD GONE FROM THE MAGAZINE A LOT ??JUST COULDN??T TAKE THE HEARTBREAK. YOU HAVE TO BE FAIRLY TOUGH TO WITHSTAND THAT.? WE SAW HER AS ONE OF HER SPREADS WAS BEING ??WHITTLED DOWN? AS SHE PUT IT IN THE SEPTEMBER ISSUE. ??I??M FURIOUS. I CARE VERY MUCH ABOUT WHAT I DO OR I WOULDN'T BE STILL DOING IT. BUT IT GETS HARDER AND HARDER TO SEE IT JUST THROWN OUT. AND IT??S VERY HARD TO GO ON TO THE NEXT THING.? BUT THE NEXT SCENE SAW CODDINGTON IN HER BELOVED PARIS AT THE COUTURE COLLECTIONS AS FABULOUS CREATION FOLLOWED FABULOUS CREATION DOWN THE RUNWAY. SURELY THE SWEETEST THING IS THAT THE EXTRA FAME AND STANDING THE SEPTEMBER ISSUE BOUGHT CODDINGTON HAS MEANT SHE IS NOW MISTRESS OF HER OWN SHIP. SHE IS ABLE NOT JUST TO VANQUISH THE ACCRUED GRIEF OVER THE CREATIVE HEARTBREAKS SHE ENDURED AT THE MAGAZINE BUT ALSO TO EXERCISE A NEW FREEDOM--TO CRAFT A FRESH CREATIVE CHAPTER THAT IS ALL HER OWN.

1006,10179436.0,2016-01-22T07:13:00+00:00,ANATOMY OF AN OSCARS BOYCOTT: WHY WILL SMITH AND OTHERS ARE TAKING A STAND,THE ACADEMY OF MOTION PICTURE ARTS AND SCIENCES HAS BEEN UNDER FIRE EVER SINCE THE ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATIONS WERE ANNOUNCED ON JANUARY 14TH. FOR THE SECOND STRAIGHT YEAR ALL TWENTY ACTING NOMINEES WERE WHITE. THE CRITICISM WAS FAST AND FURIOUS WITH CINEASTES AND PUNDITS REVIVING LAST YEAR??S #OSCARSSOWHITE HASHTAG AS THEY LAMBASTED HOLLYWOOD??S MOST FAMOUS AWARDS SHOW FOR ITS LACK OF DIVERSITY AS WELL AS THE INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE. THINGS TOOK AN EVEN MORE INTERESTING TURN AFTER JADA PINKETT SMITH VOICED HER OPINION THAT BLACK ACTORS SHOULD REJECT THE ACADEMY AS MUCH AS IT HAS REJECTED BLACK ACTORS OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. ??IS IT TIME THAT PEOPLE OF COLOR RECOGNIZE HOW MUCH POWER INFLUENCE THAT WE HAVE AMASSED THAT WE NO LONGER NEED TO ASK TO BE INVITED ANYWHERE?? SHE SAID IN A VIDEO MESSAGE SHARED ON MLK DAY. ??BEGGING FOR ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OR EVEN ASKING DIMINISHES DIGNITY AND DIMINISHES POWER. AND WE ARE A DIGNIFIED PEOPLE AND WE ARE POWERFUL.? ??SO LET??S LET THE ACADEMY DO THEM WITH ALL GRACE AND LOVE. AND LET??S DO US DIFFERENTLY.? PINKETT SMITH??S WORDS ALONG WITH POINTED CRITICISM FROM FILMMAKER SPIKE LEE (??FORTY WHITE ACTORS IN TWO YEARS AND NO FLAVA AT ALL. WE CAN??T ACT?! WTF!!? LEE WROTE ON INSTAGRAM) SPARKED A MOVEMENT TO BOYCOTT THE AWARDS SHOW. THOUGH NEITHER PINKETT SMITH NOR LEE EXPLICITLY CALLED FOR A BOYCOTT THE TRICKLE OF CRITICISM TURNED INTO A FLOOD OF ANTIPATHY AS EVERYONE FROM GEORGE CLOONEY TO TYRESE GIBSON TOOK THE ACADEMY TO TASK FOR IGNORING NON-WHITE ACTORS FOR TWO CONSECUTIVE YEARS. ??IF YOU THINK BACK 10 YEARS AGO THE ACADEMY WAS DOING A BETTER JOB? CLOONEY SAID TO VARIETY. ??THINK ABOUT HOW MANY MORE AFRICAN AMERICANS WERE NOMINATED. I THINK AROUND 2004 CERTAINLY THERE WERE BLACK NOMINEES??LIKE DON CHEADLES MORGAN FREEMAN. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU FEEL LIKE WE'RE MOVING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. THERE WERE NOMINATIONS LEFT OFF THE TABLE. THERE WERE FOUR FILMS THIS YEAR:?ŸCREED?ŸCOULD HAVE GOTTEN NOMINATIONS CONCUSSION?ŸCOULD HAVE GOTTEN WILL SMITH IDRIS ELBA COULD HAVE BEEN NOMINATED FOR?ŸBEASTS OF NO NATION AND?ŸSTRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON?ŸCOULD HAVE BEEN NOMINATED.? TYRESE??AS WELL AS RAPPER/ACTOR 50 CENT??WENT AS FAR AS CALLING FOR COMEDIAN CHRIS ROCK TO STEP DOWN AS OSCARS?? HOST. ??THERE IS NO JOKE THAT HE CAN CRACK. THERE IS NO WAY FOR HIM TO SEIZE THE MOMENT AND COME INTO THIS THING AND SAY ??I??M GOING TO SAY THIS AND SAY THAT I??M GOING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE BUT THEN I??M STILL GOING TO KEEP MY GIG AS THE HOST??? TYRESE TOLD PEOPLE. ??THE STATEMENT THAT YOU MAKE IS THAT YOU STEP DOWN.? ROCK STEPPING DOWN WOULD CARRY A POWERFULLY SYMBOLIC MESSAGE BUT DOESN??T SEEM LIKELY. IT ISN??T ALL THAT FAIR EITHER: UNLIKE ATTENDEES ROCK IS CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED TO APPEAR AT THE SHOW. MANY OF ROCK??S FELLOW COMEDIANS HAVE SUPPORTED HIM GOING FORWARD WITH HOSTING THE SHOW. ??IF I WERE CHRIS ROCK I WOULDN??T BE CONSIDERING BOYCOTTING THE OSCARS? SHARED GERVAIS. ??I??D BE THINKING ??THIS SHIT IS LIVE. I CAN DO SOME SERIOUS DAMAGE.??? GERVAIS??S UNSOLICITED ADVICE SOUNDS FULL OF DEVILISH POSSIBILITIES BUT WE SHOULDN??T ASSUME THAT A BLACK COMIC WILL BE GIVEN AS MUCH FREEDOM TO DIG HIS HEELS INTO THE ACADEMY??S NECK. ROCK ATTACKING THE OSCARS ON THEIR OWN STAGE WOULD BE UNDENIABLY BALLSY BUT COULD HE GET AWAY WITH THIS KIND OF GERVAISIAN AWARDS SHOW ANARCHY WITHOUT SPARKING A SERIOUS BACKLASH? WHO KNOWS. BUT WE SHOULDN??T PUT THE ONUS ON ROCK. THE IDEA OF BOYCOTTING THE OSCARS IS AN ATTRACTIVE SHOW OF SOLIDARITY BUT IT IS JUST THE TIP OF THE PROVERBIAL ICEBERG AS IT PERTAINS TO RACIAL BIASES IN HOLLYWOOD. NON-WHITE ACTORS AND FILMMAKERS CONTINUALLY FACE FURTHER MARGINALIZATION AND FEWER OPPORTUNITIES AND IF ANYTHING THE OSCAR BACKLASH IS PROOF THAT FANS AND CONTRIBUTORS ARE REMAINING VIGILANT IN THEIR SCRUTINY OF HOLLYWOOD. TWO YEARS AFTER STEVE MCQUEEN AND LUPITA NYONG??O NO ONE SHOULD WANT TO SEE HOLLYWOOD??S RACIAL CLOCK TURNED BACK. BUT THE IDEA OF A BOYCOTT HAS ALSO DRAWN TREMENDOUS CRITICISM. ??I MAKE MOVIES FOR A LIVING. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT THE PROBLEM IS: IT??S NOT THAT THE PEOPLE DOING THE NOMINATING ARE TOO WHITE? THE VIEW CO-HOST??AND OSCAR WINNER??WHOOPI GOLDBERG SAID IN RESPONSE TO PINKETT SMITH??S VIDEO. ??THE PROBLEM IS THE PEOPLE WHO CAN BE HELPING TO MAKE MOVIES THAT HAVE BLACKS AND LATINOS AND WOMEN AND ALL THAT??THAT MONEY DOESN??T COME TO YOU BECAUSE THE IDEA IS THAT THERE IS NO PLACE FOR BLACK MOVIES.? ??CHRIS ROCK IS THE HOST OF THE ACADEMY AWARDS AND SO TO BOYCOTT HIM SEEMS JUST AS BAD AS WHAT EVERYBODY IS SAYING? SHE SAID. ??WE HAVE THIS CONVERSATION EVERY YEAR AND IT PISSES ME OFF.? IN 1994 GOLDBERG WAS THE FIRST BLACK STAR TO HOST THE OSCARS WITHOUT A CO-HOST (SAMMY DAVIS JR. AND RICHARD PRYOR HAD HOSTED PREVIOUSLY WITH OTHER STARS.) ??BOYCOTTING DOESN??T WORK AND IT??S ALSO A SLAP IN THE FACE TO CHRIS ROCK? ADDED GOLDBERG. BLACK PLATFORMS HAVE MADE HUGE INROADS IN TERMS OF GETTING MORE BLACK CONTENT ONSCREEN AND BLACK AWARDS SHOWS DO A GREAT JOB OF CELEBRATING THAT CONTENT. BUT IF WHITE HOLLYWOOD HEARS ANYTHING AMIDST THE VOICES CALLING OUT INDUSTRY BIASES THEY SHOULD HEAR THAT NON-WHITE ACTORS DIRECTORS AND PROJECTS HAVE TO BE A PRIORITY FOR A COMMUNITY THAT SEEMS FAIRLY OUT OF TOUCH WITH THE CURRENT CULTURAL CLIMATE. TELEVISION HAS LAUNCHED SEVERAL SUCCESSFUL SHOWS WITH BLACK LEADS AND MANY OF THOSE SHOWS HAVE NETTED AWARDS FOR THEM. IF TV CAN FIND VEHICLES FOR TARAJI P. HENSON MORRIS CHESTNUT VIOLA DAVIS AZIZ ANSARI KERRY WASHINGTON KEN JEONG REGINA KING AND JENNIFER LOPEZ THEN WHY ARE THE MOST HIGH-PROFILE FILM PROJECTS STILL SO LILY-WHITE? WHETHER ONE SUPPORTS THE IDEA OF A BOYCOTT THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT CHANGE HAS TO HAPPEN IN HOLLYWOOD. AS PINKETT SMITH SUGGESTED BLACK PEOPLE AND OTHER NON-WHITE PEOPLE WILL CONTINUE TO ??DO US? AND LEAVE THE ACADEMY TO ??DO THEM.? THAT DOESN??T HAVE TO BE CALLED A ??BOYCOTT? TO BE RECOGNIZED AS A SHOW OF SOLIDARITY AND STRENGTH. BLACK AUDIENCES IN PARTICULAR HAVE RECOGNIZED THAT BLACK MOVIES DON??T HAVE TO APPEAL TO OR APPEASE WHITE TASTES TO MAKE MONEY. SOONER OR LATER HOLLYWOOD WILL BE MADE TO UNDERSTAND HOW DESPERATELY IT NEEDS THE STORIES AND THE CREATIVITY OF BROWN FOLKS. AND IN AN ERA WHEN BLACK LIVES MATTER IS THE MOST IMPORTANT POLITICAL ISSUE OF OUR TIME THIS IS ABOUT MORE THAN JUST MOVIES.?Ÿ MARK RUFFALO TWEETED HIS SUPPORT FOR THE BOYCOTT ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE ACADEMY??S BIASES ARE INDICATIVE OF DEEPER SOCIAL ILLS. ??I DO SUPPORT THE OSCAR BAN MOVEMENT'S POSITION THAT THE NOMINATIONS DO NOT REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF OUR COMMUNITY? RUFFALO TWEETED. ??THE OSCAR BAN MOVEMENT REFLECTS A LARGER DISCUSSION ABOUT RACISM IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.? WILL SMITH ECHOED RUFFALO??S CONCERNS IN AN INTERVIEW WITH GOOD MORNING AMERICA. ?Ÿ ??WHEN I SEE THIS LIST AND SERIES OF NOMINATIONS THAT COME OUT??AND EVERYBODY IS FANTASTIC AND THAT??S THE COMPLEXITY OF THIS ISSUE EVERYONE IS BEAUTIFUL AND DESERVING AND IT??S FANTASTIC??BUT IT FEELS LIKE IT??S GOING THE WRONG DIRECTION? SMITH SAID. ??THE NOMINATIONS REFLECT THE ACADEMY. THE ACADEMY REFLECTS THE INDUSTRY [HOLLYWOOD] AND THEN THE INDUSTRY REFLECTS AMERICA. THERE IS A REGRESSIVE SLIDE TOWARDS SEPARATISM TOWARDS RACIAL AND RELIGIOUS DISHARMONY AND THAT??S NOT THE HOLLYWOOD THAT I WANT TO LEAVE BEHIND. THAT??S NOT THE INDUSTRY THAT??S NOT THE AMERICA I WANT TO LEAVE BEHIND? HE ADDED. SMITH ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HIM NOT GETTING A NOMINATION FOR CONCUSSION ??PROBABLY? WAS PART OF WHAT INSPIRED HIS WIFE JADA TO VOICE HER CRITICISM. BUT IT WASN??T THE SOLE MOTIVATOR. ??THERE??S PROBABLY A PART OF THAT IN THERE BUT FOR JADA HAD I BEEN NOMINATED AND NO OTHER PEOPLE OF COLOR WERE SHE WOULD HAVE MADE THE VIDEO ANYWAY? SMITH SAID. ??WE??D STILL BE HERE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION. THIS IS SO DEEPLY NOT ABOUT ME. THIS IS ABOUT CHILDREN THAT ARE GOING TO SIT DOWN AND THEY??RE GOING TO WATCH THIS SHOW AND THEY??RE NOT GOING TO SEE THEMSELVES REPRESENTED.? AND IT??S ABOUT AN INDUSTRY THAT SEEMS ALL TOO EAGER TO TAKE THOSE CHILDREN??S MONEY AT THE BOX OFFICE. HOLLYWOOD DOESN??T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING IT DOESN??T WANT TO DO NOR DOES THE ACADEMY. ACTORS ARE TIRED OF BEING IGNORED AND THEY??RE MAKING THAT CLEAR. BUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN THE PEOPLE DECIDE THAT THEY??RE TIRED OF BEING IGNORED TOO? ,37321.0

THE FLAT SKY WAS AN OPEN OVEN DOOR AND ITS HEAT MADE PEOPLE SPILL OUT OF THE TENEMENTS AND ONTO THE STOOPS OR ONTO MILK BOXES SET UP ON THE SIDEWALK AND THEY SAT AND WATCHED THE CHILDREN PICK UP THE BRASS SHELLS AND POCKET THEM AS IF THEY WERE PRIZES. THEY WATCHED THE COPS TOO. THE COPS WERE EVERYWHERE FOUR AND FIVE OF THEM ON A STREET CORNER WEARING WHITE STEEL HELMETS AND THE PEOPLE OF HARLEM WATCHED THEM AND HATED THEM YESTERDAY AFTERNOON. ??WHEN I SEE A WHITE COP I CAN??T HELP MYSELF I JUST CAN??T STAND LOOKING AT ONE OF THEM? LIVINGSTON WINGATE WAS SAYING. ??I??M SUPPOSED TO BE A RESPONSIBLE PERSON AND I TRY TO RUB IT FROM MY MIND. BUT RIGHT NOW WHEN I LOOK ACROSS THE STREET HERE AND SEE THOSE WHITE COPS I GET DISTURBED. I JUST CAN??T STAND LOOKING AT THEM.? WINGATE IS AN OFFICIAL. HE IS A LAWYER WHO HAS WORKED FOR THE GOVERNMENT IN WASHINGTON. HE NOW IS ONE OF THE MAJOR FIGURES IN RUNNING HARYOU-ACT WHICH HAS BEEN FORMED TO HELP YOUNG PEOPLE IN HARLEM. WHEN PEOPLE OF POSITION TALK THE WAY HE DID THE TROUBLE IS BAD. AND YESTERDAY AFTERNOON WHILE EVERYBODY IN HARLEM WAITED FOR THE SUN TO GO DOWN AND NIGHT TO CLOAK THE STREETS AND MAKE MOVING AROUND EASIER YOU WONDERED JUST HOW BAD IT WOULD BECOME. SOME OF THEM WANTED TO GET AT IT IN THE DAYLIGHT. THE FIRE TRUCKS HAD 129TH STREET BETWEEN MADISON AND FIFTH TIED UP DURING AN ALARM AT 2:15 IN THE AFTERNOON AND TO MAKE ROOM FOR A HOOK AND LADDER COMING THROUGH THE GUY DRIVING US PULLED IN TO THE CURB IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BLOCK. RIGHT AWAY SOMEBODY MOVED OFF THE STOOP: A KID WITH A SHAVED HEAD AND A GOLD POLO SHIRT. HE WAS ABOUT NINETEEN AND HE WENT TO ANOTHER STOOP WHERE THREE OTHER KIDS WERE SITTING. HE SAID SOMETHING TO THEM AND THEY LOOKED AT THE CAR. THEN THEY GOT UP AND CAME ONTO THE SIDEWALK AND THE ONE WITH THE SHAVED HEAD WALKED ACROSS THE STREET AND SPOKE TO A CROWD ON ANOTHER STOOP. THEN HE CAME WALKING BACK LOOKING AT THE CAR AND WHEN YOU STARED BACK AT HIM HIS EYELIDS CAME DOWN AND MADE HIS EYES NARROW. ??WHAT ARE YOU LOOKIN?? AT YOU BIG FAT WHITE BASTARD?? HE SAID. ??OH COME ON IT??S TOO HOT FOR THIS NONSENSE? WE TOLD HIM. ??WE??RE GOIN?? TO SHOW YOU WHAT??S NONSENSE? HE SAID. ??WE??RE GOIN?? TO STICK SOME NONSENSE RIGHT INTO YOUR FAT WHITE BELLY.? A FIREMAN RUBBER BOOTS FLOPPING ON THE MELTING TAR STREET WALKED OVER FROM AN ENGINE. HE HAD AN AX IN HIS HAND. A NEW AX. BIG WITH A LIGHT YELLOW WOODEN HANDLE. THE KID WITH THE SHAVED HEAD DIDN??T EVEN NOTICE HIM. HE JUST KEPT WALKING PAST THE CAR AND WENT BACK TO THE STOOP WHERE THREE WAITED FOR HIM. ??WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE?? THE FIREMAN SAID. ??DON??T YOU LISTEN TO THE NEWSPAPERS?? ??WE??RE TRYING TO GET THROUGH.? ??THEY WERE STONING US LAST NIGHT? THE FIREMAN SAID. ??YOU DON??T KNOW WHAT IT WAS LIKE HERE. THEY WERE TRYING TO KILL US. GET OUT OF HERE IF YOU GOT ANY BRAINS.? THEN HE WENT BACK TO THE TRUCK. THE OTHER FIREMEN CAME OUT OF THE TENEMENT AND CLIMBED ONTO THE TRUCKS. THERE HAD BEEN NO FIRE AND NOW THE THREE TRUCKS WERE STARTING TO PULL AWAY. ??HEY FAT WHITE BASTARD? THE SHAVED HEAD CALLED OUT. ??WHY DON??T YOU STAY AROUND HERE TILL THESE TRUCKS LEAVE?? ??OH COME ON? HE WAS TOLD. TWO TRUCKS LEFT AND THEN THE HOOK AND LADDER MOVED BY AND THE MINUTE IT DID THE GUY DRIVING US IN THE CAR PULLED AWAY FROM THE CURB AND STARTED UP THE BLOCK. THE KIDS CAME OUT FROM BOTH SIDES. THEY WERE WALKING AT FIRST BUT THEN ONE OF THEM RAN AND TRIED TO GET IN THE BACK DOOR ON THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE BUT NOW THE CAR WAS MOVING TOO FAST AND HE COULDN??T MAKE IT AND THEN WITH THE CAR HEADING UP THE BLOCK YOU SAW HIS BARE BLACK ARM PULL BACK AND THEN COME UP AND SOMETHING CAME THROUGH THE AIR AT THE CAR. WHATEVER IT WAS IT EXPLODED WHEN IT HIT THE STREET BEHIND THE CAR. WHO KNOWS WHAT IT WAS? MOLOTOV COCKTAILS WERE ALL OVER THE PLACE SATURDAY NIGHT. MAYBE IT WAS NOTHING MORE THAN A FIRECRACKER. YOU COULDN??T TELL. IF SOMEBODY SNAPPED HIS FINGERS ON 129TH STREET IN HARLEM YESTERDAY AFTERNOON THE NOISE MADE YOU JUMP. IT ALL CAME DOWN TO THIS IN HARLEM. ALL THE TALK AND ALL THE SPEECHES AND ALL THE IGNORANCE AND ALL THE HISTORY OF THIS DEEP VICIOUS THING OF BLACK AGAINST WHITE WHICH THEY CLASSIFY UNDER THE NICE NAME OF CIVIL RIGHTS CAME CRASHING DOWN FROM THE ROOFTOPS INSIDE GARBAGE CANS. THE SYMBOL OF A COUPLE OF HUNDRED YEARS OF SINFUL HISTORY BECAME A BLACK ARM PULLING BACK ??AND THEN COMING AROUND TO THROW SOMETHING AT A WHITE COP. AND THERE SEEMED TO BE NO WAY TO TALK TO ANYBODY. FOR A WHILE THE BIG MAIN AVENUES OF HARLEM SEEMED QUIET AND POLICE-STATE ORDERLY YESTERDAY AFTERNOON THE PEOPLE SITTING ON THE SIDE STREETS WITH A BITTERNESS WHICH WENT RIGHT THROUGH YOU WHEN YOU SAW IT IN THEIR FACES. THERE SEEMED TO BE NOBODY WHO COULD STOP WHAT EVERYBODY THOUGHT THE NIGHT WOULD BRING. AT 4:15 P.M. WE DROVE TO THE MOUNT MORRIS PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH WITH JUDGE JAMES WATSON TO HEAR JESSE GRAY ADDRESS A RALLY. GRAY IS AN IRRATIONAL MAN WHO IS A FORCE IN HARLEM ONLY BECAUSE OF THE WHITE PRESS WHICH FAILED IN ITS OBLIGATION TO CHECK OUT PEOPLE IT WRITES OF. PUBLICITY MADE JESSE GRAY AND YESTERDAY AFTERNOON WAS TO BE HIS GREAT CHANCE FOR RABBLE-ROUSING. THEN JESSE GRAY GOT UP AND THIS CHURCH TURNED INTO SOMETHING YOU??VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. ??BEFORE TODAY IS OVER WE??LL BE ABLE TO SEPARATE THE MEN FROM THE BOYS? GRAY SAID WHEN HE GOT UP. ??ONLY ONE THING CAN SOLVE THE PROBLEM IN MISSISSIPPI AND THAT??S GUERRILLA WARFARE? GRAY SAID. ??I??M BEGINNING TO WONDER WHAT??S GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM HERE IN NEW YORK.? HE THREW THE LINE OUT INTO THE HOT AIRLESS CHURCH AND HE WAITED FOR THE ANSWER HE KNEW WOULD COME.

VLADISLAV RIKUNOV??S NEW ??WARM WOODY SCENT? IS THE RESULT OF SIX MONTHS OF CREATIVE OBSERVATION AND INSPIRATION THE BELARUSIAN PERFUMER TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. REKUNOV??S CREATION ??LEADER NUMBER ONE? EAU DE TOILETTE WAS DESIGNED IN BELARUS MADE IN FRANCE AND APPROVED BY PUTIN HIMSELF ACCORDING TO THE PERFUME??S DISTRIBUTORS. THE FRAGRANCE IS ON SALE IN ONLY ONE PLACE: IN THE HEART OF MOSCOW ON RED SQUARE. ON A RECENT TUESDAY CROWDS BUZZED AROUND A BRIGHTLY ILLUMINATED SKATING RINK ON RED SQUARE WHERE MUSIC PLAYED AND LIGHTS REFLECTED ON THE ICE ON COLORFUL GLASS BALLS AND ON THE ENORMOUS TOYS HANGING OFF THE CAPITAL??S LARGE CHRISTMAS TREE. MORE COLORFUL TOYS HUGE CANDIES AND ORANGES ALMOST AS BIG OF THE CLOCK ON THE KREMLIN??S TOWER DECORATED THE INTERIOR OF THE UPPER TRADING ROWS GUM A HISTORIC 19TH-CENTURY DEPARTMENT STORE KNOWN FOR PRESENTING LUXURIOUS BRANDS WITH ??BITING PRICES? AS SOME SHOPPERS PUT IT. THE PUTIN-INSPIRED EAU DE TOILETTE WAS PRESENTED ON A STAND ON GUM??S GROUND FLOOR. THE DISPLAY??S CONSERVATIVE DESIGN STOOD OUT: BLACK BOXES WITH PUTIN??S SILVER PROFILE WHICH LOOKED ALMOST TOO DRAMATIC IN THE COLORFUL MISHMASH OF THE STORE??S OVERWHELMING NEW YEAR??S DECORATIONS. INSIDE THE BOXES WERE 100 ML BOTTLES OF EAU DE TOILETTE. IN THE BLACK FRAME UNDER THE GLASS THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE??S CROWN AND A CROWNED EAGLE??S HEAD PART OF THE STATE MAIN SYMBOL WERE SEEN AS THE BACKGROUND OF PUTIN??S BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPH. NEXT TO THE PRESIDENT??S FACE WAS A LIST OF THE PERFUME??S FRAGRANCES: LEMON BERGAMOT BLACK CURRANTS BALSAM FIR CEDAR MUSK AND TONKA BEANS. THE PERFUMER SAID HE ONCE RECOGNIZED HIS PERFUME ON THE STREET IN MOSCOW. ??I WAS IN THE UNDERGROUND PEDESTRIAN PASSAGE AND SENSED MY SCENT??SEE I DELIBERATELY MADE IT NOTICEABLE AND SUSTAINABLE? REKUNOV TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. REKUNOV BELIEVES IN AROMA THERAPY: ??FRAGRANCE CHANGES THE HUMAN ORGANISM. BY BEING ABSORBED THROUGH THE BLOOD IT CHANGES HORMONE STATE AT THE MOLECULAR LEVEL? THE PERFUMER INSISTED. REKUNOV SAID HE SUGGESTED THAT MEN WEAR HIS PERFUME AT BUSINESS AND POLITICAL EVENTS AND OF COURSE THEY SHOULD PUT SOME ON FOR IMPORTANT MEETINGS. ??NOT MANY PEOPLE DISCOVER THEIR SENTIMENTAL FEELINGS IN POLITICS IT COULD BE SEEN AS WEAKNESS BUT THIS PERFUME SOFT AND ROUND CAN SHOW A SOFTER SIDE OF CHARACTER.? LAST YEAR A MOSCOW BASED MEDIA HOLDING CALLED ??LEADERS? CHOSE THE BELARUSIAN PERFUMER TO CREATE THE ??LEADER NUMBER ONE? PERFUME. TO PREPARE HIS SCENT REKUNOV ??WATCHED VIDEOS OF PUTIN??S INTERVIEWS HIS GESTURES HIS MIMICS AND LOOKS? THE PERFUMER RECALLED. ??WE ALL KNOW THAT HE CAME OUT OF THE SPECIAL SERVICES WHERE THEY TEACH PEOPLE NOT TO UNVEIL THEIR REAL EMOTIONS BUT I AM VERY OBSERVANT.? IT WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT RUSSIANS COULD BUY PUTIN??S SMELL IN A BOTTLE. INDIVIDUAL FRAGRANCES OF POLITICIANS AND OTHER CELEBRITIES BECAME POPULAR OVER A DECADE AGO. PUTIN??S FORMER WIFE LYUDMILA PUTINA WAS FAMOUS FOR ORDERING A MEN??S PERFUME FROM ZHANNA GLADKOVA A MOSCOW PERFUMER. ??ZHANNA AND I ARE FRIENDS BUT I DID NOT LISTEN TO HER FRAGRANCE??I KNOW ONLY KNOW THAT IT HAD MORE METAL A STEEL SCENT AND MINE ON THE CONTRARY [IS] SOFT ROUND FOR A MAN WHO WANTS TO BE LIKED BY A WOMAN? REKUNOV SAID. BACK AT THE DEPARTMENT STORE A YOUNG TALL SHOP ASSISTANT DRESSED IN A BLACK UNIFORM JACKET WAS ENTICING GUM VISITORS TO SMELL REKINOV??S PERFUME. NOT MANY IN THE OVERCROWDED DEPARTMENT STORE STOPPED TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE UNKNOWN FRAGRANCE. IT WAS NOT CHEAP. THE PRICE SAID 6500 RUBLES WHICH WAS A BIT MORE THAN $88. THE SHOP ASSISTANT TOLD THE DAILY BEAST THAT DISTRIBUTERS HAD MANAGED TO SELL 1000 BOTTLES OF THE PERFUME IN JUST IN FEW DAYS NEARLY A HALF OF WHAT THEY HAD AVAILABLE. BUT NOT ALL SHOPPERS WERE SO ENTHUSIASTIC. ??MY BOYFRIEND MIGHT GET A KICK OUT OF IT BUT NO TOO EXPENSIVE? A YOUNG SHOPPER MARIA TOLD THE DAILY BEAST.

GIVEN HILLARY CLINTON??S LEAD IN THE POLLS HER ENDORSEMENTS AND THE VAST AMOUNT OF MONEY SHE HAS RAISED IT MAY NOW BE ALL BUT IMPOSSIBLE FOR SANDERS TO PREVAIL.

FOR IF AMERICANS ARE TO CONFRONT THE CRISES WE FACE AND REDEEM THE NATION FROM 40 YEARS OF CLASS WAR FROM ABOVE??A CLASS WAR THAT HAS DEVASTATED AMERICA??S INDUSTRIES AND PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURES CREATED PLUTOCRATIC INEQUALITIES OF WEALTH AND POWER AND EMPOWERED CORPORATE EXECUTIVES AND CONSERVATIVE POLITICIANS TO LAY SIEGE TO THE HARD-WON RIGHTS OF WORKERS WOMEN AND BLACKS??THEN WE NEED TO REMEMBER WHAT TRULY HAS MADE AMERICA GREAT IF NOT DARE I SAY IT EXCEPTIONAL. IT MAY NOT BE TRUE THAT WE ??HAVE IT IN OUR POWER TO BEGIN THE WORLD OVER AGAIN? AS THOMAS PAINE FERVENTLY TOLD HIS FELLOW CITIZENS-TO-BE IN HIS REVOLUTIONARY PAMPHLET COMMON SENSE. BUT AS THE CRISES STRUGGLES AND EVENTS OF THE 1770S 1860S AND 1930S AND 1940S??NOT TO MENTION THE 1960S??POWERFULLY ATTEST WHEN WE HAVE GOTTEN IT IN OUR HEADS TO RISE UP AND HARNESS THE POWERS OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT TO SECURE AMERICA??S PURPOSE AND PROMISE WE NOT ONLY HAVE SUCCEEDED IN DEFENDING THE UNITED STATES AGAINST POWERFUL ENEMIES BUT ALSO IN MAKING IT BOTH STRONGER AND MORE PROSPEROUS AND FREER MORE EQUAL AND MORE DEMOCRATIC IN THE PROCESS. NOT TOO SURPRISINGLY THE 2016 GOP CANDIDATES HAVE BEEN DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO IGNORE OR SUPPRESS THE MEMORY OF THAT HISTORY. EVER SINCE RONALD REAGAN RAN FOR THE PRESIDENCY IN 1976 AND FAR MORE SUCCESSFULLY IN 1980 REPUBLICANS HAVE DONE THEIR DAMNEDEST TO NOT SIMPLY HIJACK HISTORY BUT ALSO TO BURY IT. EVIDENTLY ENAMORED OF THE GILDED AGE AND THE PROSPECT OF RETURNING US TO IT CONSERVATIVES HAVE EITHER REPEATEDLY LIED ABOUT THE PROGRESSIVE AND SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC ACHIEVEMENTS OF 20TH-CENTURY AMERICA OR AS WE HAVE WITNESSED AT THE DEBATES SPOKEN AS IF ALL OF IT HAD NEVER HAPPENED. OF COURSE PRIOR TO BERNIE??S GEORGETOWN SPEECH RECALLING FDR??S NEW DEAL INITIATIVES AND VISION OF AN ECONOMIC BILL OF RIGHTS LBJ??S GREAT SOCIETY AND WAR ON POVERTY AND MARTIN LUTHER KING??S COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM THE DEMOCRATS HAD DONE LITTLE TO HISTORICALLY CHALLENGE THE REPUBLICANS. YES HILLARY LAUNCHED HER CAMPAIGN AT THE FDR FOUR FREEDOMS PARK IN NEW YORK CITY. AND YES BERNIE CUTELY REMARKED AT THE DEMOCRATIC DEBATE IN DES MOINES IOWA THAT HE IS LESS OF A SOCIALIST THAN WAS REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT DWIGHT EISENHOWER BECAUSE HE WOULD NOT SEEK TO RAISE TAXES ON THE RICH TO THE LEVEL THAT HAD PREVAILED DURING IKE??S ADMINISTRATION IN THE 1950S. HOWEVER CLINTON MARTIN O??MALLEY AND SANDERS HAVE MADE NO REAL EFFORT TO REMIND AMERICANS OF HOW THE NATION??S GREATEST GENERATIONS AND GREATEST LEADERS TRIUMPHED OVER THE CRISES THEY CONFRONTED AND IN THAT LIGHT WHAT WE MIGHT ENDEAVOR TO DO TODAY. IF THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO DO MORE THAN WIN THE PRESIDENCY AND CARRY OUT AS BERNIE SANDERS DECLARES A ??POLITICAL REVOLUTION? THEY NEED TO START REDEEMING AMERICA??S GREATEST GENERATIONS AND THOSE WHO INSPIRED AND LED THEM. THEY NEED TO LAY CLAIM TO OUR GREATEST RADICALS AND TO OUR GREATEST PRESIDENTS. NOT JUST FDR??BUT ALSO WASHINGTON AND ESPECIALLY LINCOLN. ALL OF THOSE FOREFATHERS CAME TO PURSUE BOTH RADICAL-DEMOCRATIC ACTION AND PROGRESSIVE NATION-BUILDING. ROOSEVELT HIMSELF OBSERVED IN THE EARLY 1930S THAT IT WAS TIME FOR THE DEMOCRATS TO LAY CLAIM TO NOT JUST THE DEMOCRATIC-REPUBLICAN THOMAS JEFFERSON (WHOM HE LIBERATED FROM SOUTHERN CONTROL) BUT ALSO THE REPUBLICAN ABRAHAM LINCOLN (WHOM HE WAS CONVINCED THE GOP HAD ABANDONED LONG AGO). AND FDR DEFINITELY HAD IN MIND NOT JUST LINCOLN THE EMANCIPATOR BUT ALSO LINCOLN THE NATION BUILDER. IN FACT THE 32ND PRESIDENT REGULARLY QUOTED THE 16TH PRESIDENT TO EXPLAIN HIS OWN VIEW OF THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT: ??THE LEGITIMATE OBJECT OF GOVERNMENT IS TO DO FOR A COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE WHATEVER THEY NEED TO HAVE DONE BUT CANNOT DO AT ALL OR CANNOT DO AS WELL FOR THEMSELVES IN THEIR SEPARATE AND INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES.? LONG BEFORE ORWELL WROTE 1984 FDR KNEW THE STRUGGLE FOR THE PRESENT AND FUTURE BEGINS AS A STRUGGLE FOR THE PAST. HIS BEST FIRESIDE CHATS AND SPEECHES WERE ESSENTIALLY HISTORY LESSONS??LESSONS IN WHICH HE REMINDED HIS FELLOW CITIZENS OF AMERICA??S PURPOSE AND PROMISE AS THE GREAT EXPERIMENT IN FREEDOM EQUALITY AND DEMOCRACY AND EXPLAINED TO THEM HOW HIS NEW DEAL INITIATIVES EMBODIED THE NATION??S FINEST VALUES AND ASPIRATIONS. MOREOVER HE REMINDED AMERICANS THAT WHAT HAD BEEN ACHIEVED BY EARLIER GENERATIONS CAME NOT SIMPLY BY EXECUTIVE ACTION FROM ABOVE BUT BY WAY OF STRUGGLES FROM THE BOTTOM UP. IF THE DEMOCRATS HOPE TO COUNTER 40 YEARS OF REAGANESQUE RHETORIC HYPING LIMITED GOVERNMENT LOWER TAXES AND CORPORATE FREEDOM THEY ??NEED TO EMULATE THEIR TOO-LONG-NEGLECTED PRESIDENTIAL CHAMPION FDR. THEY NEED TO STUDY UP ON U.S. HISTORY AND MAKE CLEAR TO THEIR FELLOW AMERICANS HOW THEIR PROGRESSIVE ARGUMENTS AND POLICY PROPOSALS EMANATE FROM THE BEST OF AMERICAN HISTORY AND POLITICS. WITH THOSE LABORS IN MIND I HEARTILY RECOMMEND THAT HILLARY MARTIN AND BERNIE READ HOLZER AND GARFINKLE??S NEW BOOK ON LINCOLN AND HIS LEGACY. A JUST AND GENEROUS NATION IS A WORK OF TWO PARTS. IN PART ONE HOLZER AND GARFINKLE PORTRAY LINCOLN AS A MAN WHO WAS CONVINCED THAT AMERICA HAD BEEN CREATED FOR A PURPOSE??TO MAKE REAL THE DECLARATION??S PROPOSITION THAT ??ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL? AND ITS PROMISE OF ??LIFE LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS???AND WHO CAME TO RECOGNIZE THAT IT WAS HIS POLITICAL TASK CHALLENGE AND DUTY NOT SIMPLY TO DEFEND AND SECURE THAT PURPOSE AND PROMISE AGAINST THOSE WHO WOULD SEEK TO DENY THEM BUT ALSO??AS THE PREAMBLE TO THE CONSTITUTION STATES??TO PURSUE DEMOCRATIC INITIATIVES TO ASSURE AND ADVANCE THEM. THEY DO NOT EXACTLY SAY IT BUT HOLZER AND GARFINKLE PRESENT LINCOLN AS A PIONEERING PROGRESSIVE AND A ??PREMATURE FDR LIBERAL? IF NOT A PROTO SOCIAL DEMOCRAT.?Ÿ (I CAN ALREADY HEAR THE SHRIEKS OF CONSERVATIVES.) LIKE MOST SCHOLARS HOLZER AND GARFINKLE??THE FORMER A LEADING LINCOLN BIOGRAPHER THE LATTER AN ACCOMPLISHED ECONOMIST AND BUSINESSMAN??RIGHTLY INSIST THAT WHAT DROVE LINCOLN??S COMMITMENT TO SUSTAIN THE UNION TO FIGHT THE CIVIL WAR THE BLOODIEST WAR IN AMERICAN HISTORY AND ULTIMATELY TO ABOLISH SLAVERY AND BRING AN END TO THE ??HOUSE DIVIDED? WAS HIS DEEPLY HELD BELIEF IN AMERICA??S EXCEPTIONAL PURPOSE AND PROMISE. HOWEVER HOLZER AND GARFINKLE OFFER AN ESSENTIALLY FRESH TAKE ON ALL OF THAT. WITHOUT AT ALL SLIGHTING LINCOLN??S DETERMINATION TO HOLD THE UNION TOGETHER AND HIS HATRED OF SLAVERY FOR WHAT IT WAS DOING TO AMERICANS BOTH BLACK AND WHITE THEY FORCEFULLY AND PERSUASIVELY ARGUE THAT LINCOLN??S UNDERSTANDING OF AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM??AMERICA AS THE ??LAST BEST HOPE OF EARTH???WAS THAT THE UNITED STATES WAS FOUNDED TO BE A LAND NOT JUST OF CIVIL EQUALITY AND POLITICAL DEMOCRACY BUT ALSO OF ??ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY.? THEIR LINCOLN SAW AMERICA AS TOCQUEVILLE SAW IT: AS THE WORLD??S FIRST ??MIDDLE-CLASS NATION.? GROSS INEQUALITIES??SLAVERY THE GROSSEST OF THEM ALL??DENIED THAT VISION. IF AMERICANS NATIVE-BORN AND IMMIGRANT WERE TO DEVELOP AND SUSTAIN A MIDDLE-CLASS SOCIETY IN WHICH OPPORTUNITIES ABOUNDED SLAVERY NEEDED TO BE CONTAINED AND IN TIME DESTROYED. AS HOLZER AND GARFINKLE SHOW BY WAY OF LINCOLN??S OWN WORDS LINCOLN HELD THAT IN CONTRAST TO THE OLD REGIME LANDS OF EUROPE AND THE REST OF THE WORLD PAST AND PRESENT THE UNITED STATES WAS FOUNDED ON AN IDEA: ??THE IDEA THAT THIS COUNTRY ??PROPOSED TO GIVE ALL A CHANCE?? AND ALLOW ??THE WEAK TO GROW STRONGER.??? THEREFORE THE UNION HAD TO PREVAIL OVER THE CONFEDERACY TO ASSURE THE SURVIVAL OF AMERICA??S WORLD-HISTORIC PURPOSE AND PROMISE AND SLAVERY HAD TO BE DESTROYED TO GUARANTEE THAT PURPOSE AND PROMISE FOR ALL AMERICANS. AND AGAIN IT WAS NOT JUST A MATTER OF SECURING THE NATION??S PROMISE BUT ALSO OF ADVANCING IT. AS HOLZER AND GARFINKLE RECOUNT FROM HIS EARLY POLITICAL DAYS AS A YOUNG WHIG WHO BELIEVED IN HENRY CLAY??S AMERICAN SYSTEM THROUGH HIS TRYING TIMES AS THE NATION??S FIRST REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT LINCOLN SAW GOVERNMENT ACTION NOT AS INHERENTLY AND INEVITABLY A THREAT TO LIBERTY AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY (REPUBLICANS AIN??T WHAT THEY USED TO BE!) BUT ALL THE MORE AS A POTENTIALLY GREAT DEMOCRATIC FORCE THAT AMERICANS MIGHT HARNESS TO FOSTER ECONOMIC GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT CREATE OPPORTUNITIES AND EMPOWER WORKING AMERICANS TO MAKE SOMETHING OF THEMSELVES AND THE NATION. LINCOLN??S GREATEST AND MOST RADICAL ACT WAS TO SIGN THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION. BUT EVEN IN THE MIDST OF THE HORRORS OF WAR HE AND THE CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS APPLIED THE POWERS OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT TO NATION BUILDING.?Ÿ MOST NOTABLY IN 1862 HE SIGNED INTO LAW BOTH THE HOMESTEAD ACT AFFORDING LOW-PRICED 160-ACRE TRACTS OF WESTERN LANDS TO SETTLERS AND THE MORRILL ACT AKA THE LAND GRANT ACT WHICH GRANTED PUBLIC LANDS TO STATES TO SET UP PUBLIC COLLEGES. AND NO LESS HISTORICALLY IMPORTANT HE CHARTERED THE FIRST TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROAD AND SIGNED A BILL THAT SET THE PRECEDENT FOR THE LATER CREATION OF THE U.S. NATIONAL PARK SYSTEM. ISN??T ALL OF THIS WHAT LINCOLN HIMSELF WAS SAYING AT GETTYSBURG IN NOVEMBER 1863? AS HOLZER AND GARFINKLE PUT IT: WHEN LINCOLN SPOKE OF A ??NEW BIRTH OF FREEDOM? HE WAS REFERRING NOT JUST TO ABOLISHING SLAVERY BUT ALSO TO THAT OF ENHANCING DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT AND THE CHANCES THAT AMERICANS COULD CONTINUE TO PURSUE THE MAKING OF A MIDDLE-CLASS SOCIETY. ??GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE [AND] BY THE PEOPLE? HAD TO BECOME AS WELL GOVERNMENT ??FOR THE PEOPLE.? IN THE SECOND PART OF THEIR BOOK HOLZER AND GARFINKLE EXAMINE LINCOLN??S LEGACY THE FIGURES AND FORCES THAT TURNED THEIR BACKS ON IT AND THOSE WHO SOUGHT TO REDEEM AND ADVANCE IT. THEY TAKE US THROUGH THE REPUBLICAN-DOMINATED BUT ANTI-LINCOLNIAN GILDED AGE THE PROGRESSIVE ERA OF THEODORE ROOSEVELT AND WOODROW WILSON THE NEW DEAL AND SECOND WORLD WAR YEARS OF FDR AND HIS RE-ARTICULATION OF LINCOLN??S WORDS AND VISION IN THE FOUR FREEDOMS THE POSTWAR PRESIDENCIES OF EISENHOWER KENNEDY AND JOHNSON AND THE MAKING OF LBJ??S LINCOLN-LIKE GREAT SOCIETY INITIATIVES THE REAGAN REVOLUTION AND ITS ANTI-LINCOLNIAN INSISTENCE THAT ??GOVERNMENT IS THE PROBLEM? AND THROUGH THE DEMOCRATIC AND GOP PRESIDENCIES OF THE PAST 40 YEARS. THESE LATER CHAPTERS MAKE THEIR CASES FOR FDR AND AGAINST NOT ONLY RONALD REAGAN BUT ALSO JIMMY CARTER WHOSE DEREGULATION OF CAPITAL AND ABANDONMENT OF LABOR PAVED THE WAY FOR REAGAN.?Ÿ THOUGH I WOULD ADD THAT HOLZER AND GARFINKLE ARE MUCH TOO KIND TO BILL CLINTON WHO ENACTED NAFTA BLUNDERED TERRIBLY ON NATIONAL HEALTH CARE AND??BRINGING ABOUT THE GREAT RECESSION??BROUGHT AN END TO FDR??S GLASS-STEAGALL ACT. THE BOOK IS FLAWED IN OTHER WAYS AS WELL. IT PRESENTS A HISTORY FROM THE TOP DOWN. IN HOLZER AND GARFINKLE??S NARRATIVE PRESIDENTS ACT AND WE ALL WATCH AND BENEFIT OR SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES. BEFORE WRITING HOLZER AND GARFINKLE SHOULD HAVE READ THE WORKS BY JAMES OAKES IRA BERLIN AND JOHN NICHOLS THAT REVEAL HOW LINCOLN WAS MOVED TO ACT BY RADICALS ABOLITIONISTS AND SLAVES AND WORKING PEOPLE THEMSELVES. STILL IF HILLARY MARTIN AND BERNIE WANT TO REDEEM AMERICAN DEMOCRACY AND SAVE AMERICAN MIDDLE-CLASS SOCIETY FROM THE THROES OF PLUTOCRACY AND THE EVILS OF CLASS WAR FROM ABOVE THEY WOULD DO VERY WELL TO READ A JUST AND GENEROUS NATION. ,7723.0

OR IF IT??S NOT A HEALTHY FEEDER GIVES ANY CLUES AS TO WHY NOT.? I SIT IN STUPEFIED AMAZEMENT AT THAT STATEMENT.

PRETTY MUCH EVERY BOTTLE ON THE MARKET TODAY HAS LITTLE MARKS ON THE SIDE THAT WILL TELL MOMS AND DADS THE VOLUME OF FORMULA OR BREAST MILK THEIR CHILD IS OFFERED AND HOW MUCH THEY HAVE CONSUMED.?Ÿ IF YOUR BABY IS TAKING AN AGE-APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF OUNCES (AND YOUR PEDIATRICIAN IS GLAD TO REVIEW THAT AMOUNT WITH YOU) ON A RELATIVELY CONSISTENT SCHEDULE THEN THE HEALTHY FEEDER ISSUE IS EASILY SETTLED. IF THE BABY IS GAINING WEIGHT AT A GOOD CLIP I AM AT A LOSS TO DETERMINE WHAT OTHER INFORMATION MIGHT BE HELPFUL. DOES YOUR BABY BOTTLE HOLD LIQUID? CHECK. CAN YOU ATTACH A NIPPLE? CHECK. CONGRATULATIONS YOU HAVE ALL THE ELEMENTS REQUIRED. WHILE THERE IS A VARIETY OF ADDITIONAL FEATURES YOU CAN FIND AND SOME BABIES TAKE BETTER TO ONE STYLE OR ANOTHER THE BASICS ARE PRETTY UNIVERSAL. NOT TO BE OUTDONE BY ADVANCES IN CONTAINER SCIENCE HOWEVER MAKERS OF FORMULA ITSELF ARE ALSO IN PURSUIT OF PRODUCTS NEEDED BY NO ONE. TO WIT THE GERBER BABYNES A KEURIG-LIKE APPARATUS THAT PROMISES A ??BRILLIANT FUTURE? FOR BABIES LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE FED BY ONE. PARENTS POP IN A POD OF VARIOUS DIFFERENT FORMULAS THAT ARE ??PERFECTLY IN-SYNC WITH [BABY??S] DEVELOPMENT? WHICH APPEAR TO VARY EVERY FEW WEEKS OR MONTHS. CUSTOMERS CAN SIGN UP FOR ADDITIONAL SERVICES LIKE WEIGHT TRACKERS AND CONVENIENT REMINDERS TO ORDER MORE CAPSULES OF FORMULA. IF THIS ARTICLE COULD INCLUDE SOUND CLIPS HERE IS WHERE I WOULD INSERT ONE OF ME POUNDING MY HEAD AGAINST MY DESK. EVEN FOR PARENTS WHO OPT FOR THE BURDEN OF MIXING WATER AND SCOOPS OF POWDER WHICH TAKES WHOLE MINUTES TO ACCOMPLISH THE ARRAY OF FORMULA VARIETIES NOW AVAILABLE CAN BE DIZZYING. STROLL DOWN THE AISLE OF BABY PRODUCTS AT YOUR LOCAL SUPERMARKET AND WITNESS THE STUNNING NUMBER OF DIFFERENT LABELS. THERE ARE SOME ADVERTISED TO CONTROL FUSSINESS AND OTHERS FOR MOTHERS WHO CHOOSE TO SUPPLEMENT THEIR NURSING WITH FORMULA. THERE ARE YET MORE THAT SUPPOSEDLY MEET THE NUTRITIONAL NEEDS OF TODDLERS. WHEN PARENTS ASK ME ABOUT THESE PRODUCTS I TELL THEM THEY??RE TO ENSURE THEIR CHILD RECEIVES THE RECOMMENDED DAILY ALLOWANCE OF MARKETING. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT WHATEVER PURPORTED BENEFIT PROMISED BY THE DIFFERENT FORMULAS THEY DO NOT REMOTELY JUSTIFY THE INCREASE IN PRICE POINT. WHEN MY OLDEST CHILD WAS AN INFANT I STOOD IN THE AISLE AT TARGET AND COMPARED AN EXPENSIVE NAME BRAND WITH THE GENERIC VARIETY. THEY WERE IDENTICAL INGREDIENT BY INGREDIENT. ABSENT A MEDICAL NEED FOR A DIFFERENT FORMULA THE STORE BRAND IS WHAT I RECOMMEND TO MY PATIENTS NOW. FOR TODDLERS THERE??S MILK. THE CLUE AS TO WHY THESE PRODUCTS EXIST AND WHY A ??SMART? BOTTLE MAY BE ON THE HORIZON IS HIDDEN IN SOMETHING WADSWORTH SAID ABOUT THE GOALS FOR HIS NEW GIZMO. SPECIFICALLY HE SAID ??THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE PRODUCT IS TO TREAT FEEDING AS A PERFORMANCE ISSUE.? BECAUSE GOD FORBID WE TREAT CHILD-REARING AS SOMETHING OTHER THAN A SERIES OF PERFORMANCE ISSUES STARTING WITH NATURAL CHILDBIRTH AND ENDING WITH AN IVY LEAGUE DEGREE. THE APOTHEOSIS OF THIS MINDSET CAME A WHILE AGO IN THE FORM OF AN ESSAY BY A MOTHER WHO KEPT SPREADSHEETS OF EVERY LAST LITTLE THING HER INFANT DAUGHTER DID FROM QUALITY OF POOP TO HOW ATTENTIVE SHE SEEMED WHEN HER PARENTS READ ISSUES OF POPULAR SCIENCE TO HER. AFTER ??QUANTIFYING? HER CHILD THUSLY THE AUTHOR PRESSED HER PEDIATRICIAN TO GIVE HER DAUGHTER SOME KIND OF SCORE.?Ÿ IN RESPONSE HE TOLD HER SHE NEEDED TO CHILL OUT. (PEACE BE UPON YOU WHEREVER YOU ARE UNNAMED COLLEAGUE.) THIS DOES NOT STOP HER FROM CONGRATULATING HERSELF FOR GIVING THE BEST KIND OF ATTENTION TO HER KID IN CONTRAST TO OTHER MOTHERS SHE DESCRIBES IN THE PIECE. STOP TRYING TO OPTIMIZE YOUR CHILDREN PARENTS OF AMERICA! AND STOP TELLING THEM TO OUGHT TO BE EVERYONE ELSE. OBVIOUSLY WE ALL WANT OUR CHILDREN TO GROW AND SUCCEED AND FLOURISH. WE WANT THEM TO BE HEALTHY AND HAPPY AND STRIVE TO GIVE THEM ALL WE CAN IN ORDER TO MAKE THOSE THINGS HAPPEN. OBSESSING AND TRACKING AND MONITORING ARE INEXTRICABLY LINKED TO PARENTING CERTAINLY IN TODAY??S SOCIETY. BUT SPEAKING AS BOTH A PEDIATRICIAN AND A PARENT KIDS LOVE NOTHING MORE THAN TO TAKE OUR EXPECTATIONS AND DANCE GIDDILY UPON THEM UNTIL NOTHING IS LEFT BUT A FINE DUST. SCRUTINIZING EVERY TIME THEY WHIMPER OR PASS GAS WILL NOT GUARANTEE ADMISSION TO PRINCETON AND A VAST NUMBER OF PEOPLE WOULDN??T BE HAPPY THERE ANYWAY. WE NEED TO STOP ACTING AS THOUGH CHILDREN REQUIRE A PROSPECTUS BOTH FOR THEIR SAKE AND OUR OWN. IT IS NEITHER GOOD FOR CHILDREN NOR EFFECTIVE?ŸTO MAXIMIZE ARBITRARY FACTORS IN SEARCH OF SOME PERFECT OUTCOME MEASURE. LOVE YOUR KIDS. FEED THEM A HEALTHY DIET. ENCOURAGE THEM TO EXERCISE AND SOCIALIZE READ AND PLAY. IF IMMEDIATELY AFTER THEY??RE BORN THEY LOSE A LITTLE WEIGHT MAYBE YOUR PROVIDER WILL TELL YOU TO KEEP TRACK OF THEIR FEEDING AND POOPING FOR A SHORT TIME. BUT THEN LET IT GO. BUT SKIP THE SPREADSHEETS AND THE NEWFANGLED BOTTLES.?Ÿ ,7343.0

BUT THE TRUE STATE OF HIS FUNDRAISING STRATEGY IS EVEN MORE ASTONISHING THAN THAT: THE SANDERS CAMPAIGN DOESN??T HAVE A FINANCE TEAM. AND THAT??S A BIG DEAL. EVERY COMPETITIVE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN IN RECENT ELECTION CYCLES HAS HAD TEAM OF PEOPLE EXCLUSIVELY DEDICATED TO FINANCES: FIGURING OUT HOW MUCH MONEY THE CAMPAIGN NEEDS PUTTING TOGETHER A PLAN TO GET THAT MONEY AND THEN MAKING IT ALL COME TOGETHER. IT??S CONSIDERED A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF A MODERN PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN RIGHT UP THERE WITH HAVING A TEAM TO DEAL WITH THE PRESS. BUT SANDERS MAY BE CHANGING THAT. CALL IT A REINVENTION OF CAMPAIGN FUNDING BUT THE VERMONT SENATOR HAS SHOWN SO FAR THAT A CAMPAIGN CAN OPERATE JUST FINE WITHOUT A FLEET OF GREEN-VISORS COUNTING THE CASH. ??I??VE NEVER HEARD OF A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN EVEN A MINOR PARTY PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN THAT DIDN??T HAVE A FUNDRAISING TEAM? SAID ONE CAMPAIGN FINANCE ATTORNEY. ??BUT OK IF IT??S WORKING.? AND JUDGING BY SANDERS?? LATEST FUNDRAISING NUMBERS IT IS. ??IN THE PAST THERE WAS ALWAYS THE DIGITAL TEAM AND THE FINANCE TEAM AND THEY HATED EACH OTHER? SAID CRAIG ENGLE A CAMPAIGN FINANCE ATTORNEY. ??BUT NOW YOU??VE GOT A SITUATION??AT LEAST WITH BERNIE SANDERS??WHERE NOW THE DIGITAL TEAM AND THE FINANCE TEAM IS THE SAME TEAM.? SYMONE SANDERS A SPOKESPERSON FOR THE CAMPAIGN CONFIRMED TO THE DAILY BEAST THAT THE CAMPAIGN DOESN??T HAVE ANYONE ON STAFF FOCUSED FULL-TIME ON RAISING MONEY.

WE??VE ONLY DONE A FEW OF THOSE.? SHE ESTIMATED THAT THE CAMPAIGN HAS HAD FEWER THAN A DOZEN IN-PERSON FUNDRAISING EVENTS. INSTEAD IT??S RAKED IN MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF CASH??$33 MILLION IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS OF 2015 AND ABOUT $73 MILLION OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR??THROUGH ONLINE FUNDRAISING. POLITICO REPORTED THAT REVOLUTION MESSAGING A FIRM IN D.C. MANAGES THE CAMPAIGN??S ONLINE FUNDRAISING. IN THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS OF 2015 HIS CAMPAIGN PAID THE FIRM A TOTAL OF $3.8 MILLION. SO: NOT A TERRIBLE ROI. LARRY SABATO WHO HEADS THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA??S CENTER FOR POLITICS SAID SANDERS DECISION TO OPT OUT OF HAVING A FINANCE TEAM IS ??REMARKABLE.? ??WHO ISN??T IMPRESSED WITH SANDERS?? FUNDRAISING?? HE SAID. ??HE HAS MORE OR LESS KEPT PACE WITH CLINTON AND IN A KEY WAY??SMALL GIFTS WHICH HAVE A LOT MORE PUNCH IN POLITICS??SANDERS HAS EXCEEDED HER BY A MILE.? IN THOSE LAST THREE MONTHS SANDERS RAISED JUST FOUR MILLION DOLLARS LESS THAN HILLARY CLINTON DESPITE HAVING ZERO STAFF DEDICATED TO FUNDRAISING.

IN THIS CASE THOUGH MOOK MAKES A PRETTY DECENT ARGUMENT: THE SUCCESS OF SANDERS UNORTHODOX FUNDRAISING STRATEGY HAS CAUGHT EVERYONE OFF GUARD. SANDERS CAN SKATE BY WITHOUT A FUNDRAISING TEAM BECAUSE OF THE KIND OF DONORS HE ATTRACTS.

ENGLE SAID DONORS WHO SHELL OUT FOUR FIGURES TEND TO PREFER GIVING IT TO A FUNDRAISER THEY KNOW OR AT A SOCIAL EVENT WHERE THEY FEEL LIKE THEY??RE PART OF A GROUP.

THE ORIGINATORS OF THE SO-CALLED ??BIRTHER? MOVEMENT ARE LEADING A CHARGE THIS CAMPAIGN CYCLE WITH THE SAME ACCUSATIONS THEY HAD TWO CAMPAIGN CYCLES AGO. EIGHT YEARS AGO THE LOOSELY-ORGANIZED GROUP CAME TOGETHER OTHER-IZING THE MAN WHO WOULD BECOME THE FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT. NOW THEY??RE ATTEMPTING TO DO SO WITH THE POTENTIAL FIRST LATINO ONE. AND IT??S NOT JUST ISOLATED FRINGE BLOGGERS WHO HAVE TAKEN UP THE MANTLE. WORLDNETDAILY A SITE THAT HAS TOUTED BOTH DONALD TRUMP AND CRUZ AND BEEN ESSENTIAL READING FOR THEIR FANS IS SUPPORTING THE CAUSE AS WELL. THE SENATOR FROM TEXAS WAS BORN IN CALGARY CANADA TO AN AMERICAN MOTHER AND A CUBAN FATHER. CRUZ RELEASED HIS BIRTH CERTIFICATE IN 2013 AND RENOUNCED HIS CANADIAN CITIZENSHIP A YEAR LATER IN ADVANCE OF HIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN IN AN ATTEMPT TO PUT THE ISSUE TO BED BEFORE IT REACHED NATIONAL HEADLINES IN THIS CAMPAIGN CYCLE. AND THAT MIGHT OF PUT THE ISSUE TO BED IF DONALD TRUMP HAD NOT QUESTIONED HIS LEGITIMACY AS A CANDIDATE. ??HOW DO YOU RUN AGAINST THE DEMOCRAT WHOEVER IT MAY BE AND YOU HAVE THIS HANGING OVER YOUR HEAD IF THEY BRING A LAWSUIT?? TRUMP SAID IN AN INTERVIEW ON CNN THIS WEEK. AND JUST LIKE THAT WITH ONE QUESTION THE REAL ESTATE MOGUL EFFECTIVELY BROUGHT THIS ISSUE FROM THE FAR-REACHES OF CONSPIRACY INTERNET SITES TO THE FOREFRONT OF AMERICAN DIALOGUE. TRUMP LATER SUGGESTED THAT CRUZ ASK A JUDGE FOR A ??DECLARATORY JUDGMENT? THAT WOULD PUT THIS ISSUE TO BED. THIS OF COURSE WOULD LIKELY CREATE A SPECTACLE THAT COULD PROVE POLITICALLY ADVANTAGEOUS TO TRUMP WHO IS CURRENTLY LOSING TO CRUZ IN IOWA THE FIRST PRIMARY STATE. ??I??M DOING THIS FOR THE GOOD OF TED?? I LIKE HIM. HE LIKES ME? TRUMP?ŸASSERTED. WHILE THIS READS AS A WITCH HUNT TO MOST EYES??AKIN TO TRUMP??S PREVIOUS EFFORTS TO GET OBAMA??S BIRTH CERTIFICATE RELEASED??MANY OF THE ORIGINAL FOUNDERS OF THE 2008 MOVEMENT SEEM TO AGREE WITH THE LEADING REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE. UNLIKE OBAMA THEY LIKE CRUZ AND THEY WANT HIM TO CLEAR THE AIR ON THIS BIRTH ISSUE BEFORE IT??S TOO LATE. ??I THINK IT DOES DISQUALIFY HIM? SAID TEO BEAR WHO WARNED ABOUT THE ISSUE OF TED CRUZ??S BIRTH ON HIS SITE BIRTHERS.ORG IN 2014. ??LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION IF YOU WERE DATING A GIRL AND YOU COME TO REALIZE THAT SHE WANTED TO GET SERIOUS AND WANTED TO HAVE CHILDREN AND YOU DIDN??T WANT PUPPIES DON??T YOU THINK YOU SHOULD TELL HER ??I DON??T WANT PUPPIES???? IN THE SAME MANNER BEAR THINKS THAT CRUZ SHOULD BE FORTHRIGHT WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND GO TO THE SUPREME COURT TO GET THIS QUESTION RESOLVED ONCE AND FOR ALL. THE ORIGIN OF THE PROBLEM FOR BEAR AND HIS BIRTHER ASSOCIATES WHEN IT COMES TO OBAMA CRUZ AND ESPECIALLY MARCO RUBIO IS THE CONSTITUTIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE PHRASE ??NATURAL BORN CITIZEN.? THE BIRTHER MOVEMENT WOULD SUGGEST THAT ANYONE BORN IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY??IN CRUZ??S CASE CANADA??WOULD NEED TO BECOME FORMALLY NATURALIZED IN A COURT OF LAW BEFORE BEING CONSIDERED A NATURAL BORN CITIZEN IN THE UNITED STATES. MOST?ŸLEGAL EXPERTS CONTEND THAT CRUZ MEETS THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THIS CONSTITUTIONAL STANDARD BY HAVING AN AMERICAN MOTHER AND THUS OBTAINING HER CITIZENSHIP UPON HIS BIRTH. IN 1790 AFTER THE REVOLUTION THE UNITED STATES PASSED THE NATURALIZATION ACT WHICH SAID THAT CHILDREN WHO WERE BORN TO U.S CITIZENS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES ALSO QUALIFIED AS CITIZENS. BUT THESE STANDARDS ARE NOT CLEAR ENOUGH PROOF FOR PEOPLE LIKE JOSEPH FARAH THE EDITOR-IN-CHIEF OF CONSERVATIVE SITE?ŸWORLDNETDAILY. ??IS THAT WHAT THE FOUNDERS MEANT? FARAH SAID IN A PHONE INTERVIEW WITH THE DAILY BEAST. ??WAS IT ENOUGH TO HAVE ONE PARENT BE AN AMERICAN CITIZEN? DOES IT MATTER WHERE YOU??RE BORN? THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE. IT??S NOT SOME CRAZY CONSPIRACY THEORY. IT??S NOT SOME GAME. IT??S THE CONSTITUTION WE??RE TALKING ABOUT.? YET THE MUSTACHIOED PURVEYOR OF CONSPIRACY THEORIES ABOUT OBAMA??S BIRTH IN KENYA REALLY LIKES CRUZ POLITICALLY AND CALLED HIM ??A TERRIFIC CANDIDATE.? ??I PERSONALLY THINK TED CRUZ IS A TERRIFIC CANDIDATE ONE OF THE SMARTEST GUYS IN ANY ROOM HE GOES INTO? FARAH SAID COMING SHORT OF ENDORSING CRUZ. ??I THINK HE??D BE A FINE PRESIDENT.? AFTER ALL WND SELLS A BOOK BY CRUZ??S FATHER RAFAEL CALLED ??A TIME FOR ACTION: EMPOWERING THE FAITHFUL TO RECLAIM AMERICA? WHICH DETAILS HOW CHRISTIANS SHOULD GET MORE INVOLVED IN POLITICS. NOT TO MENTION WND??S CLOSE AFFILIATION WITH A FELLOW CRUZ-LOVER FRANK GAFFNEY WHO HAS SAID THAT GROVER NORQUIST IS A SECRET INFORMANT FOR THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD. SO IT??S NOT AS IF FARAH DOESN??T WANT CRUZ TO SUCCEED??IN FACT HE??S RAISING THESE ISSUES TO ENSURE THAT HE CAN. FARAH WORRIES THAT IF THE DEBATE ABOUT ELIGIBILITY STANDARDS DOES NOT HAPPEN SOON CRUZ??S BIRTH WILL NEGATIVELY IMPACT REPUBLICAN PRIMARY VOTERS. AND HE SUGGESTED IT??S ONLY COMING UP NOW BECAUSE IT IS POLITICALLY ADVANTAGEOUS FOR TRUMP TO CREATE THIS DIALOGUE. ??THE DAY THAT RUBIO EMERGES AS A SUPER THREAT THE QUESTIONS WILL BE RAISED ABOUT HIM? FARAH SAID ECHOING A SIMILAR SENTIMENT THAT MANY BIRTHERS SHARE ABOUT THE LEGITIMACY OF THE FLORIDA SENATOR??S CITIZENSHIP STATUS. ??IT JUST DEPENDS ON WHOSE OX IS BEING GORED.? AS THIS DEBATE ABOUT CRUZ??S PRESIDENTIAL ELIGIBILITY HAS DRAGGED ON??WITH?ŸJOHN MCCAIN WHOSE BIRTH WAS PREVIOUSLY QUESTIONED RAISING THE SPECTRE OF DOUBT ABOUT CRUZ AND DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN ALAN GRAYSON FILING A LAWSUIT??THE RHETORIC FROM THE O.G.S OF THE BIRTHER MOVEMENT HAVE BEEN RATCHETING UP. ??HE??S NOT ELIGIBLE BECAUSE HE??S NOT BORN IN THE COUNTRY?MARIO APUZZO  AN INSURANCE ATTORNEY FROM NEW JERSEY WHO FILED A LAWSUIT IN FEDERAL COURT IN 2009 AGAINST PRESIDENT-ELECT BARACK OBAMA DICK CHENEY NANCY PELOSI AND CONGRESS ALLEGING THAT CONGRESS HAD NOT PROPERLY VERIFIED HIS ELIGIBILITY TO BE PRESIDENT. IN 2010 THE SUPREME COURT DENIED TO HEAR THE CASE AFTER A FEDERAL COURT IN NEW JERSEY DISMISSED IT AND THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS UPHELD THE DISMISSAL. ??HE WAS BORN TO AN ALIEN FATHER? APUZZO SAID OF CRUZ. ??HE??S GOT A WORSE SITUATION THAN PRESIDENT OBAMA.? APUZZO ADDED THAT CRUZ BECAUSE OF HIS BIRTHPLACE WOULD HAVE ??DIVIDED ALLEGIANCES? COMPROMISING HIS ABILITY TO LEAD. THIS IS AN ARGUMENT EMPLOYED BY OTHER ORIGINAL MEMBERS OF THE MOVEMENT WHO WORRY THAT A CRUZ PRESIDENCY WOULD SET A BAD PRECEDENT FOR FUTURE AMERICAN POLITICIANS. CHARLES KERCHNER A SELF-DESCRIBED ??RETIRED PROFESSIONAL ELECTRICAL ENGINEER? WHO WAS ONE OF THE PLAINTIFFS IN APUZZO??S SUIT THINKS THAT IT??S TIME FOR CRUZ TO DROP OUT OF THE RACE ENTIRELY. ??WHAT IF THE NEXT TIME IT??S NORTH KOREA?? KERCHNER SAID ABOUT CRUZ??S COUNTRY OF BIRTH. ??YOU??RE EITHER PREGNANT OR YOU??RE NOT.

WHY DO YOU HAVE TO GO TO ALL THESE SEXY IMMIGRANT TYPES? KERCHNER SAID EXASPERATED WITH SOME OF THE GOP CHOICES. WHILE MAINSTREAM MEDIA AND CRUZ HIMSELF MIGHT SCOFF AT THESE SUGGESTIONS FROM PEOPLE LIKE APUZZO??WHO SAID HE??S TIRED OF BEING CALLED ??A KOOK?- WHEN THESE SAME QUESTIONS WERE RAISED ABOUT OBAMA THEY GAINED SOME GROUND. IN?Ÿ2011 A QUARTER OF AMERICANS POLLED THOUGHT THAT OBAMA WAS BORN IN A DIFFERENT COUNTRY.

BUT DURING THAT INTERIM DEMOCRACY SUCH AS IT IS SETTLED RATHER MORE LIGHTLY ACROSS MUCH OF THE COUNTRY. IN THE STATE OF VERACRUZ FOR EXAMPLE THE ADMINISTRATIONS OF THE PRI??S FIDEL HERRERA BELTR?­N AND NOW JAVIER DUARTE DE OCHOA WHICH HAVE COLLECTIVELY GOVERNED THE STATE FOR MORE THAN A DECADE HAVE SEEN AN EVER-GREATER BLURRING OF THE LINES BETWEEN POLITICAL CADRES LAW ENFORCEMENT AND DRUG TRAFFICKERS. A GULF CARTEL ACCOUNTANT EVEN TESTIFIED IN A U.S. FEDERAL COURT THAT HE HAD FUNNELED $12 MILLION IN CARTEL MONEY TO HERRERA BELTR?­N??S ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN IN EXCHANGE FOR MOVING NARCOTICS FREELY THROUGH THE STATE.

MATTHEW PERRY MIGHT NOT REMEMBER ANY OF IT ACCORDING TO COMMENTS HE MADE DURING AN INTERVIEW WITH BBC RADIO HOST CHRIS EVANS. WHEN ASKED WHICH EPISODE OF FRIENDS WAS HIS LEAST FAVORITE THE ACTOR REPLIED ??I THINK THE ANSWER IS I DON??T REMEMBER THREE YEARS OF IT SO NONE OF THOSE. I WAS A LITTLE OUT OF IT AT THE TIME. SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SEASONS THREE AND SIX.? PERRY NOW AN OUTSPOKEN ADDICTION RECOVERY ADVOCATE FAMOUSLY STRUGGLED WITH ADDICTIONS TO ALCOHOL AND SEVERAL PRESCRIPTION DRUGS WHILE FILMING THE BELOVED SITCOM. IN 1997 THE ACTOR COMPLETED A 28-DAY PROGRAM FOR VICODIN ADDICTION LATER TELLING LARRY KING THAT HE TOOK THE PAINKILLER ??MOSTLY JUST TO NOT DRINK AS MUCH AS I WAS.? IN 2001 NEAR THE END OF PERRY??S PURPORTED MEMORY GAP HE ENTERED A REHAB HOSPITAL TO RECOVER FROM HIS USE OF VICODIN METHADONE AMPHETAMINES AND ALCOHOL. BUT CAN ALCOHOL AND PRESCRIPTION DRUGS REALLY WIPE AWAY THREE YEARS WORTH OF FILMING OR AT LEAST MAKE THEM ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO REMEMBER? WHILE THE PARTICULARS OF PERRY??S CONDITION AREN??T PUBLIC SUBSTANCE ABUSE CAN INDEED HAVE POWERFUL EFFECTS ON HUMAN MEMORY RANGING FROM MILD IMPAIRMENT TO COMPLETE LOSS. ALCOHOL AND MEMORY LOSS ARE OF COURSE OLD FRIENDS. IN HIS BBC INTERVIEW PERRY SAID THAT HE WAS NEVER DRUNK WHILE FILMING FRIENDS BUT THAT HE WAS OFTEN ??PAINFULLY HUNGOVER.? BUT EVEN APART FROM THE WELL-KNOWN EFFECTS OF BLACKOUTS ON A NIGHT OUT ALCOHOL CAN IMPAIR LONG-TERM MEMORY IN OTHER MORE PERMANENT WAYS. AS BRAIN RESEARCHER DR. AARON WHITE WROTE FOR THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISM (NIAAA) ??ALCOHOL PRIMARILY INTERFERES WITH THE ABILITY TO FORM NEW LONG-TERM MEMORIES LEAVING INTACT PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED LONG-TERM MEMORIES AND THE ABILITY TO KEEP NEW INFORMATION ACTIVE IN MEMORY FOR BRIEF PERIODS.? IN OTHER WORDS IT WOULD BE ENTIRELY POSSIBLE TO FILM A TV SHOW BUT HAVE DIFFICULTY RECALLING THE EXPERIENCE YEARS LATER. A LARGE BODY OF ANIMAL STUDIES AS DR. WHITE OBSERVES HAVE SHOWN THAT ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION CAN DISRUPT OR DAMAGE THE HIPPOCAMPUS A REGION OF THE BRAIN THAT AIDS IN FORMING NEW LONG-TERM MEMORIES. ??AS THE AMOUNT OF ALCOHOL CONSUMED INCREASES? HE WROTE ??SO DOES THE MAGNITUDE OF THE MEMORY IMPAIRMENTS.? THE AMOUNT OF ALCOHOL THAT PERRY CONSUMED WAS INDEED SUBSTANTIAL. IN 2002 PERRY TOLD PEOPLE THAT FOR A TIME HE WAS DRINKING ??PROBABLY A QUART OF VODKA A DAY.? THERE ARE OTHER MORE SERIOUS LONG-TERM MEMORY PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AS WELL. BECAUSE MANY ALCOHOLICS SUFFER FROM A THIAMINE DEFICIENCY THEY ARE AT AN INCREASED RISK FOR DEVELOPING A RARE DISORDER CALLED KORSAKOFF??S SYNDROME WHICH AS THE NIAAA PUTS IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO ??LAY DOWN? NEW INFORMATION. CLINICALLY THIS SYMPTOM IS KNOWN AS ANTEROGRADE AMNESIA FAMOUSLY DEPICTED IN THE 2000 FILM MEMENTO. ??FOR EXAMPLE? THE ALZHEIMER??S ASSOCIATION NOTES ??INDIVIDUALS [WITH KORSAKOFF??S SYNDROME] MAY SEEM ABLE TO CARRY ON A COHERENT CONVERSATION BUT MOMENTS LATER BE UNABLE TO RECALL THAT THE CONVERSATION TOOK PLACE OR TO WHOM THEY SPOKE.? PERRY DIDN??T DEVELOP KORSAKOFF??S SYNDROME??THOSE WHO SUFFER FROM IT TYPICALLY REQUIRE LONG-TERM RESIDENTIAL CARE??BUT THE DISORDER DEMONSTRATES THE FULL RANGE OF ALCOHOL??S ABILITY TO DAMAGE LONG-TERM MEMORY. BUT WHAT ABOUT PERRY??S OTHER RELATED BATTLES WITH VICODIN METHADONE AND AMPHETAMINES? IN HIS 2002 PEOPLE PROFILE PERRY SAID THAT HE WAS TAKING ??AN INSANE NUMBER OF [VICODIN] PILLS? AT THE HEIGHT OF HIS ADDICTION TO THE OPIOID PAINKILLER. MUCH OF THE RESEARCH ON THESE DRUGS FOCUSES ON THEIR VARYING EFFECTS ON ??WORKING MEMORY? RATHER THAN LONG-TERM MEMORY. AS DEFINED BY BRITISH PSYCHOLOGIST ALAN BADDELEY WORKING MEMORY ??REFERS TO A BRAIN SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES TEMPORARY STORAGE AND MANIPULATION OF THE INFORMATION NECESSARY FOR SUCH COMPLEX COGNITIVE TASKS AS LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION LEARNING AND REASONING.? ADDING TWO NUMBERS IN YOUR HEAD FOR EXAMPLE RELIES HEAVILY ON WORKING MEMORY AND IN THAT SENSE IT IS COMPARABLE TO A COMPUTER??S RAM RATHER THAN SAY THE HARD DRIVE WHERE INFORMATION IS STORED LONG-TERM. WHILE IT??S A SAFE BET THEN THAT PERRY??S PROBLEMS WITH PRESCRIPTIONS CONTRIBUTED TO HIS BEHAVIOR ON SET??HE TOLD PEOPLE THAT HE WAS ??SLEEPY AND SHAKY AT WORK???HIS SELF-REPORTED THREE-YEAR MEMORY GAP PROBABLY HAD MORE TO DO WITH THAT DAILY QUART OF VODKA THAN IT DID WITH PILLS. AND WHILE PERRY MAY NOT REMEMBER A LARGE FRACTION OF FRIENDS HE HAS GONE ON TO HELP OTHERS RECOVER FROM THEIR OWN STRUGGLES WITH ADDICTION AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE. IN ADDITION TO HIS FREQUENT PUBLIC SPEAKING AND WRITING ON THE ISSUE THE ACTOR TURNED HIS MALIBU PROPERTY INTO AN ADDICTION RECOVERY CENTER AND RECEIVED A 2013 CHAMPION OF RECOVERY AWARD FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. ??IT WASN??T A QUESTION OF STRENGTH? PERRY RECENTLY TOLD THE BBC OF HIS RECOVERY. ??IT WAS A QUESTION OF WHETHER I WANTED TO LIVE OR DIE??THAT WAS THE REAL DECISION. I??M HAPPY TO SAY THAT I CHOSE LIFE.? ,33326.0

209,9662496.0,2016-01-06T05:01:00+00:00,THE SECRET HYPOCRITICAL GAY WORLD OF ISIS,THE MURDER OF A 15-YEAR-OLD TEENAGER THROWN TO HIS DEATH BY ISIS FOR BEING GAY NOT ONLY REVEALS??YET AGAIN??THE TERROR GROUP??S MURDEROUS HOMOPHOBIA BUT ALSO THE HYPOCRISY THAT EXISTS ALONGSIDE IT. A SENIOR ISIS COMMANDER NAMED IN REPORTS AS ABU ZAID AL-JAZRAWI WAS HAVING SOME KIND OF RELATIONSHIP WITH THIS AS-YET-NAMELESS 15-YEAR-OLD BUT THE MORE SENIOR MAN WAS NOT KILLED. INSTEAD HE?ŸWAS REPORTEDLY FLOGGED AND FORCED TO LEAVE SYRIA AND JOIN THE FIGHTING FRONTS IN NORTHWESTERN IRAQ. THE BOY KILLED IN DEIR EZ-ZOR SYRIA??S SEVENTH LARGEST CITY IS NOT THE FIRST TO BE MURDERED IN SUCH A MANNER: THE IMAGES OF MEN ACCUSED AND SUSPECTED OF BEING GAY BEING THROWN TO THEIR DEATHS FROM TALL BUILDINGS HAS BECOME BRUTALLY FAMILIAR. ON TUESDAY THE UK-BASED SYRIAN OBSERVATORY FOR HUMAN RIGHTS TOLD THE INDEPENDENT THAT AT LEAST 25 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED BY ISIS FOR BEING GAY: SIX STONED TO DEATH THREE KILLED BY BEING SHOT IN THE HEAD AND 16 THROWN FROM HIGH-RISE BUILDINGS. OF THE 15-YEAR-OLD??S KILLING ??THE HORRIFIC EXECUTION TOOK PLACE IN FRONT OF A LARGE CROWD? A LOCAL MEDIA ACTIVIST AND AN?ŸEYEWITNESS TOLD SYRIAN NEWS AGENCY ARA NEWS. ??THE BOY WAS ACCUSED OF BEING ENGAGED IN A HOMOSEXUAL RELATION WITH THE PROMINENT ISIS OFFICER ABU ZAID AL-JAZRAWI? MEDIA ACTIVIST SARAI AL-DIN TOLD THE AGENCY.?Ÿ THE SHARIA COURT IN DEIR EZ-ZOR REPORTEDLY SAID THAT ABU ZAID SHOULD LIKE THE BOY DIE FOR BEING GAY BUT ISIS COMMANDERS DEMANDED HE BE SENT TO FIGHT IN IRAQ INSTEAD. SUBHI NAHAS A GAY SYRIAN WHO ESCAPED THE COUNTRY FEARING FOR HIS LIFE AND WHO IN A HISTORY-MAKING SPEECH ADDRESSED THE UNITED NATIONS LAST YEAR ABOUT LGBT PERSECUTION IN SYRIA TOLD THE DAILY BEAST THAT THERE WERE POSSIBLE CULTURAL REASONS BEHIND THE MURDER OF ONE YOUNG MAN AND THE REPRIEVE OF HIS OLDER SEXUAL PARTNER DESCRIBED AS THE TEEN??S ??RAPIST?? IN SOME REPORTS. ??IN WRITINGS AFTER THE FORMATION OF ISLAM THERE CAME THE IDEA OF YOUNG BOYS KNOWN AS GELMAN WHO WERE HERMAPHRODITE OR UNDERAGE USED FOR THE PLEASURE OF OLDER MEN BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT GET PREGNANT? SAID NAHAS. ??THE BOYS WERE CASTRATED SO THEY COULD NOT GROW FACIAL HAIR.? THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE 15-YEAR-OLD??S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMMANDER ARE CONTRADICTORY: IT HAS BEEN VARIOUSLY DESCRIBED AS A ??SEXUAL RELATION? AND ??RAPE.? HOW CONSENSUAL OR COERCIVE THE RELATIONSHIP WAS IS UNCLEAR AS IS THE NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE OLDER AND YOUNGER MAN. ??CULTURALLY ISLAM ALWAYS RELATED HOMOSEXUALITY TO PEDOPHILIA? SAID NAHAS NOW AN ACTIVIST WITH THE ORGANIZATION FOR REFUGE ASYLUM & MIGRATION (ORAM). ??NO DISTINCTION IS DRAWN BETWEEN THE TWO. IF SOMEBODY RAPED A BOY THEY CALLED HIM A HOMOSEXUAL NOT A PEDOPHILE. MAYBE THIS COMMANDER HAD A KIND OF WAIVER GIVEN TO HIM BY HIS PEERS. THEY THINK ??HE DOES GREAT THINGS FOR PEOPLE. WE CANNOT KILL HIM BUT WE NEED A SCAPEGOAT THE BOY.?? ??THEY DON'T CALL THIS RELATIONSHIP OR [THESE] MEN ??GAY??? SAID NAHAS. ??IF A MAN HAS SEX WITH ANOTHER MAN THE TWO PARTIES ARE THE RECEPTIVE ONE AND THE ??INSERTER.?? IF YOU??RE THE RECEPTIVE PARTY YOU??RE DOOMED. YOU??RE SEEN AS SODOMIZED SOMEONE HAS DONE THIS TO YOU YOU??RE THE ABOMINATION. IF YOU??RE THE INSERTER YOU ARE IN CONTROL YOU'RE FUNCTIONAL YOU CAN REPRODUCE.? NAHAS SAID THE CASE WAS ALSO PUZZLING: HE HAD HEARD THAT WHILE ISIS WAS SPARING EFFEMINATE GAY MEN ??FOR THE PLEASURE OF OLDER MEN? THE ??MASCULINE? MEN SUSPECTED OF BEING GAY WERE BEING KILLED. IN THIS CASE IT APPEARED TO NAHAS THAT THE ISIS COMMANDER??S SENIORITY POSSIBLY PROTECTED HIM. ??THEY NEEDED A SCAPEGOAT THEY NEEDED A BOY TO KILL. THERE SHOULD BE ANOTHER PART TO THIS STORY BUT PEOPLE ARE NOT WILLING YET TO GIVE US ANY INFORMATION BECAUSE IT??S VERY SENSITIVE.? MICHAEL LUONGO EDITOR OF GAY TRAVELS IN THE MUSLIM WORLD TOLD THE DAILY BEAST THAT THE MURDER OF THE 15-YEAR-OLD SHOWED ISIS?? HYPOCRISY. ??IT GOES TO THE IDEA THAT IN SOME PARTS OF THE MIDDLE EAST AND OTHER CULTURES BEING THE PENETRATOR IS OK ??BECAUSE THAT IS NOT UNMANLY.? LUONGO ADDED ??IF THE SEX WAS WITH A 15-YEAR-OLD BOY I WOULD BE CERTAIN HE WAS THE ONE WHO WAS PENETRATED WHO WAS RAPED. THE HYPOCRISY WOULD ALSO BE ADDED TO IN THAT IT WOULD BE STARTED BY THE DESIRES OF THE GUY WHO WAS NOT HARSHLY PUNISHED BY THE COMMANDER. ??WE HAVE SEEN THIS TYPE OF HYPOCRISY IN OTHER SO-CALLED RELIGIOUS GROUPS SUCH AS THE TALIBAN. THE HORROR IS ADDED TO BY THE SENSE THE 15-YEAR-OLD WAS ESSENTIALLY RAPED AND THEN MURDERED FOR HIS HAVING BEEN RAPED.? NAHAS TOLD THE DAILY BEAST THAT GAY MEN JOINED ISIS TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES SOMETIMES REPORTING ON FELLOW GAYS TO CONCEAL THEMSELVES MORE EFFECTIVELY. ??SOME NEW RECRUITS REPORT FRIENDS THEY USED TO HAVE SEX WITH BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE IT??S THE RIGHT THING TO DO.? NAHAS SAID THAT ORAM WAS STILL TRYING TO ESTABLISH THE VERACITY OF A WEBSITE THAT APPEARED LAST YEAR THAT PURPORTED TO SHOW MEMBERS OF ISIS ENGAGED IN GAY SEXUAL ACTS AND POSES. THE SITE NAHAS SAID WAS ESTABLISHED BY AN ASYLUM SEEKER NOW IN EUROPE AND WHILE SOME OF THE PHOTOS HAD BEEN PHOTOSHOPPED OTHER DETAILS??MEN WEARING A CERTAIN KIND OF CAMOUFLAGE AND WITH ISIS FLAGS IN THE BACKGROUND??SUGGESTED SOME OF THE PICTURES WERE REAL ??BUT PEOPLE CANNOT CONFIRM THIS BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID. WE DO KNOW OF REPORTS THAT GAY PEOPLE ARE IN ISIS OR HAVING SEX WITH MEMBERS OF THE MILITIA. ??IN DOING SO THEY SECURE PROTECTION FOR THEMSELVES AND A SAFE HAVEN FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND??IF THEY HAVE THEM??THEIR CHILDREN. AT THE SAME TIME THEY CAN HAVE SEX IN THE BACKGROUND. THEY KNOW THEY ARE PROTECTED. THEY ARE NOT INVESTIGATED. NOW THE MESSAGE OF THIS LATEST INCIDENT IS ??IF YOU ARE SENIOR ENOUGH WITH US AND HAVING GAY SEX YOU WILL NOT BE EXECUTED.??? SPEAKING FOR ORAM??FOUNDED IN 2008 AS ??THE?ŸONLY?ŸINTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION DEVOTED?ŸSOLELY?ŸTO ADVOCATING FOR LESBIAN GAY BISEXUAL TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX (LGBTI) REFUGEES FLEEING BRUTALIZATION DUE TO SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR GENDER IDENTITY???NAHAS SAID SYRIA REMAINED ??VERY DANGEROUS? FOR GAYS. ??WE HEAR FROM PEOPLE WITHIN SYRIA LOOKING FOR ANY WAY THEY CAN GET OUT OR FIND A WAY TO GET RESETTLED. THEY ARE TOO AFRAID TO REPORT WHAT IS GOING ON. LOTS ARE BEING KIDNAPPED LOTS ARE BEING KILLED. THEY ARE EITHER SCARED FOR THEIR LIFE OR HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO TO ESCAPE AND HOW TO DO IT.? NAHAS EMPHASIZED THAT THE DANGER TO LGBT PEOPLE IN SYRIA DID NOT JUST COME FROM ISIS BUT FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND OTHER GROUPS--EXTREME AND NOT. ANOTHER MILITANT ISLAMIC GROUP AHRAR ASH-SHAM ALSO TARGETED GAYS??AND A THIRD GROUP WHICH NAHAS CALLED THE JUDICIAL COURT IN ALEPPO EXECUTED SEVEN PEOPLE ACCUSED OF BEING GAY AND OF BEING DRUG USERS BY SHOOTING THEM IN THEIR HEADS. THE GROUP ALSO KILLED A 17-YEAR-OLD BOY ACCUSED OF BEING GAY. ??THE TARGETING OF GAY PEOPLE IN SYRIA IS ESCALATING EVEN BY GROUPS WHO SAY THEY ARE SECULAR? SAID NAHAS. ??THEY BELIEVE THAT GAY PEOPLE ARE ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS THERE IS WAR IN SYRIA AND THEY NEED TO BE KILLED SO THE WAR CAN BE WON.? JUST AS THE 15-YEAR-OLD IN THE MOST RECENT KILLING MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SCAPEGOAT SO ARE LGBTS BEING TREATED AS SUCH MORE GENERALLY. NAHAS SAID HE KNEW OF BETWEEN 100 AND 125 LGBT SYRIANS IN TURKEY AWAITING RESETTLEMENT ABROAD AS HE HIMSELF EVENTUALLY SECURED LAST YEAR AFTER A PERILOUS AND TERRIFYING ESCAPE FROM SYRIA. OF WATCHING THE UNFOLDING EVENTS FOR LGBT PEOPLE IN HIS HOME COUNTRY NAHAS WHO NOW LIVES IN THE U.S. SAID ??IT??S DEVASTATING. YOU FEEL PARALYZED. YOU FEEL LIKE YOU CANNOT DO ANYTHING. AND YOU FEEL LIKE ??HOW AND WHY IS THIS HAPPENING AND WHAT LED TO IT??? YOU CANNOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND I NEED TO DO SOMETHING AND WANT TO DO SOMETHING BUT THERE??S NOTHING I CAN DO. ??I ALWAYS PUT MYSELF IN THEIR SHOES AND ALWAYS THINK ??THAT COULD BE ME THAT COULD HAVE BEEN ME AT ANY MOMENT.?? THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH RESOURCES AND GAYS ARE AFRAID AND SCARED AND THEY??RE BEING TARGETED AND KILLED.? NAHAS PAUSED. ??IT??S JUST TOO MUCH.? ,226359.0

A SUSPECTED ISIS SUICIDE BOMBER KILLED 10 TOURISTS IN THE HEART OF TURKEY??S LARGEST CITY ON TUESDAY SENDING A CHILLING MESSAGE TO THE COUNTRY THAT BORDERS ON THE SELF-STYLED JIHADIST CALIPHATE. THE BLAST TOOK PLACE IN THE HISTORIC NEIGHBORHOOD OF SULTANAHMET HOME TO THE BLUE MOSQUE THE HAGIA SOPHIA AND OTHER TOP DESTINATIONS FOR THE MORE THAN 10 MILLION TOURISTS THAT VISIT ISTANBUL EVERY YEAR. A GROUP OF TOURISTS MOST OF THEM GERMANS HAD GATHERED AT THE SO-CALLED HIPPODROME THE SITE OF ANCIENT CHARIOT RACES AT AROUND 10:20 AM LOCAL TIME WHEN A 28-YEAR-OLD MAN JOINED THE GROUP AND TRIGGERED THE EXPLOSIVES HE WAS CARRYING WITH HIM. EYEWITNESSES SPOKE OF A ??BALL OF FLAMES? SHOOTING UP FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE GROUP AS BODY PARTS WERE HURLED ACROSS THE SQUARE AND THE BOOM OF THE POWERFUL EXPLOSION RANG OUT ALL OVER THE CITY. LEYLA AKCAM A TURKISH WOMAN PASSING BY THE HIPPODROME SHORTLY BEFORE THE BLAST TOLD TURKISH MEDIA SHE HEARD THE EXPLOSION AND TURNED AROUND. ??THERE WAS SMOKE EVERYWHERE? SHE SAID. ??I ESCAPED BY THREE MINUTES JUST THREE MINUTES.? MEDIA REPORTS SAID THAT SOME LIMBS LANDED IN THE ENTRANCE AREA OF A MUSEUM ACROSS THE SQUARE WHERE OFFICIALS CLOSED THE DOORS AND LED VISITORS OUT OF THE BUILDING THROUGH A BACK EXIT. POLICE CORDONED OFF THE SQUARE AS AMBULANCES ARRIVED TO CARRY AWAY THE WOUNDED AND THE DYING AND AS BOMB EXPERTS LOOKED FOR A POSSIBLE SECOND EXPLOSIVE DEVICE. THEY DID NOT FIND ONE. SPEAKING IN ANKARA JUST HOURS AFTER THE EXPLOSION PRESIDENT RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN AND PRIME MINISTER AHMET DAVUTOGLU FIRMLY PUT THE BLAME ON ISIS. ERDOGAN SAID THE SUICIDE BOMBER WAS A SYRIAN NATIONAL WHILE DAVUTOGLU DECLARED THE KILLER HAD BEEN A ??FOREIGN ISIS MEMBER?. OBSERVERS SAID THE FACT THAT ANKARA HAD IDENTIFIED THE MAN SO QUICKLY COULD BE A SIGN THAT THE SUSPECTED BOMBER HAD BEEN KNOWN TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN SHADOWED BY POLICE OR INTELLIGENCE SERVICES. ??SOMEBODY DROPPED THE BALL? ABDULLAH BOZKURT A JOURNALIST CRITICAL OF THE GOVERNMENT WROTE ON TWITTER. THE GOVERNMENT DENIED THAT THE MAN HAD BEEN ON A WATCH LIST AND SAID THE SUSPECT HAD CROSSED INTO TURKEY FROM SYRIA ONLY RECENTLY. SOME NEWS REPORTS SAID THE SUICIDE BOMBER WAS A SAUDI NOT A SYRIAN NATIONAL. TUESDAY??S BOMBING FOLLOWS A SPATE OF ISIS SUICIDE ATTACKS IN ANKARA AND NEAR THE SYRIAN BORDER LAST YEAR THAT KILLED MORE THAN 130 PEOPLE AND IT IS THE FIRST ATTACK TO DIRECTLY TARGET FOREIGN NATIONALS AND THE TOURISM INDUSTRY THAT GENERATES BILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY YEAR. LAST YEAR??S ATTACKS KILLED TURKISH CITIZENS??LEFTIST AND KURDISH ACTIVISTS SEEN AS APOSTATES BY THE JIHADISTS. SOME ARE CONCERNED THAT TUESDAY??S SUICIDE BOMBING COULD BE THE STARTING POINT OF A NEW ISIS OFFENSIVE. ??ISIS WILL TARGET TURKEY IN 2016 AND IS AIMING TO PROCLAIM A TURKEY PROVINCE IN FEBRUARY OR MARCH? JOURNALIST METE SOHTAOGLU WROTE ON TWITTER. CRITICS SAY ANKARA HAS FAILED TO TAKE ISIS SERIOUSLY FOR TOO LONG AND SOME OPPOSITION POLITICIANS HAVE EVEN ACCUSED THE GOVERNMENT OF PROVIDING WEAPONS TO EXTREMIST GROUPS. ANKARA SAYS THIS IS NOT TRUE BUT WESTERN DIPLOMATS LIKE THE FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO TURKEY FRANCIS RICCIARDONE SAY THAT TURKISH AUTHORITIES WERE CONVINCED IN THE FIRST PHASE OF THE SYRIAN CONFLICT THAT THEY COULD WORK WITH GROUPS LIKE THE NUSRA FRONT THE AL-QAEDA-AFFILIATED GROUP IN SYRIA. DAVUTOGLU SAID TUESDAY THAT TURKEY WANTED TO PUSH ISIS AWAY FROM THE SYRIAN BORDER. THE JIHADISTS HAVE BEEN USING TURKISH TERRITORY AS A CORRIDOR TO BRING FRESH FIGHTERS AND SUPPLIES INTO SYRIA. THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN REPORTS THAT ISLAMIST FIGHTERS HAVE GONE TO TURKEY FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT BEFORE HEADING BACK INTO SYRIA. BUT ISIS HAS FOUND IT HARDER LATELY TO KEEP SUPPLY LINES OPEN IN RECENT WEEKS AS THEY ARE POUNDED BY COALITION AIRSTRIKES AND PUSHED BACK FROM SOME BORDER CROSSING POINTS BY THE ADVANCE OF KURDISH FIGHTERS BACKED BY U.S. AIR SUPPORT. THE TURKISH MILITARY HAS ALSO STARTED TO BUILD WALLS AND FENCES ALONG SOME SECTORS OF ITS 560-MILE BORDER WITH SYRIA AND THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION SAYS IT IS WORKING WITH TURKEY TO CLOSE THE LAST REMAINING WEAK POINTS. SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY SAID LAST NOVEMBER THAT 75 PERCENT OF THE BORDER HAD BEEN SHUT OFF TO ISIS. WITH TUESDAY??S ATTACK ISIS COULD BE SAYING THAT IT CANNOT BE DEFEATED BY THOSE EFFORTS. SHORTLY BEFORE THE NEW YEAR POLICE IN ANKARA ARRESTED TWO MEN ACCUSED OF PLANNING A DOUBLE SUICIDE ATTACK IN THE TURKISH CAPITAL ON NEW YEAR??S EVE. NEWS REPORTS AT THE TIME SAID RAIDS ON THE HOUSE WERE THE TWO MEN STAYED NETTED E-MAILS AND OTHER EVIDENCE THAT ISIS WAS PLANNING TERROR ATTACKS IN EUROPE. OTHER REPORTS SAY ISIS HAS SENT SEVERAL SUICIDE TEAMS INTO TURKEY. AFTER TUESDAY??S BLOOD BATH ON THE HIPPODROME THE HUNT FOR THOSE SLEEPER CELLS WILL BE ON. BUT THERE IS NOT GUARANTEE THAT TURKISH POLICE WILL FIND THE POTENTIAL KILLERS BEFORE THEY CAN STRIKE AGAIN. ,13638.0

I??VE HAD TO PUT IT BACK IN MY POCKET TWICE.? IT SHOULDN??T BE NECESSARY FOR MCKELLEN TO REMIND HOLLYWOOD OF ITS HOMOPHOBIA BUT HE RIGHTLY DID. AS KEVIN O??KEEFE WROTE IN MIC CRUNCHING THE NUMBERS OF OSCAR-NOMINATED FILMS AND ACTORS OVER THE LAST DECADE REVEALS A SHOCKING PAUCITY OF LGBT-THEMED FILMS IN THE BEST PICTURE CATEGORY AS WELL AS A TOTAL LACK AS MCKELLEN SAID OF OUT-GAY ARTISTS IN THE ACTING CATEGORIES. OF THE 78 FILMS NOMINATED FOR BEST PICTURE SINCE 2007 ONLY 5 PER CENT HAD AN LGBTQ PROTAGONIST 95 PER CENT HAD A HETEROSEXUAL PROTAGONIST. THE PRESENCE OF OUT PERFORMERS LIKE ELLEN DEGENERES AND NEIL PATRICK HARRIS OBSCURES THE CONTINUED DEARTH OF OUT A-LIST ACTORS. THE NAMES YOU CAN NAME ARE INDIVIDUALS ONE-OFFS??ZACHARY QUINTO??NOT PART OF A LARGE OR COMMANDING GROUP. WHY THIS IS AND WHY THERE ARE SO FEW GAY-THEMED MOVIES GETTING MADE AND REWARDED IS PART OF A VICIOUS CIRCLE THAT TAKES IN BOTH MONEY AND SIMPLE COWARDICE. TELEVISION NOT FILM IS WHERE WE GO NOW TO SEE BLACK AND LGBT CHARACTERS OF VARIETY AND NUANCE MAINSTREAM FILM??S VIEW OF THE WORLD SEEMS PALLID ANACHRONISTIC VERY WHITE AND VERY STRAIGHT IN COMPARISON. MOVIE-MAKING HOLLYWOOD IS AN INDUSTRY AND LIKES FILMS TO MAKE MONEY AND THE FEELING IS SIMPLY THAT GAY-THEMED MOVIES WITH GAY LEAD CHARACTERS??AND THE STATISTICS WOULD SEEM TO IMPLY GAY LEAD ACTORS??WILL NOT MAKE MONEY. THE AUDIENCE WILL BE NERVOUS OF THEM AND THUS REJECT THEM. IF THE AUDIENCE DOES NOT GO TO A MOVIE THAT FILM WILL NOT MAKE MONEY. AND SO HOLLYWOOD??A PLACE NOT EXACTLY EMPTY OF LGBT PEOPLE??FIGHTS SHY OF DOING RIGHT BY LGBTS. BEING COMPLICIT IN THIS ODD CIRCLE OF SILENCE AND IGNORANCE SURELY MUST BE STRANGE FOR LGBT PEOPLE WORKING IN HOLLYWOOD UNLESS THEIR VENALITY AND AMBITION CANCEL OUT THEIR ENTIRE SENSE OF POLITICAL AND CULTURAL ENGAGEMENT. OF COURSE FROM TIME TO TIME AN ODD BIG-SCREEN SUCCESS??PREFERABLY OF A VINTAGE STYLE INVOLVING PEOPLE FIGHTING TO ASSERT THEIR SAME-SEX IDENTITIES AND DESIRES IN DIFFERENT TIMES (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN CAROL)??BREAKS THROUGH. HOLLYWOOD PATS ITSELF ON THE BACK. HOWEVER THESE EXCEPTIONS PROVE A NEGATIVE RULE. MILK ABOUT HARVEY MILK WAS A TRUE WONDERFUL RARITY: THE EXAMINATION OF A TRUE GAY HERO??S LIFE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE AND NOT DRAWN TO ELICIT SYMPATHY. BUT OF COURSE MILK??S HEROISM IS UNDERSCORED BY HIS ASSASSINATION AND HIS MINTING AS A GAY RIGHTS MARTYR. OTHER LGBT MOVIES ARE MADE AND ATTAIN THEIR OWN STATUS INDEPENDENTLY??LIKE THE BRILLIANT VIBRANT FRISKY TANGERINE. BUT RATHER LIKE THE INSTITUTIONALIZED RACISM THE LACK OF BLACK OSCAR NOMINATIONS REVEALED THE LACK OF OPENLY GAY ACTORS AND GAY-THEMED FILMS SHOWS HOLLYWOOD??S INSTITUTIONALIZED HOMOPHOBIA??AN INSTITUTIONALIZED HOMOPHOBIA THAT GAY MEN AND WOMEN PRESIDE OVER THEMSELVES TO TURN A PROFIT. THE OUTRAGE OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS HAS BEEN CENTERED ON THE OSCARS THEMSELVES BUT THE OSCARS ARE THE SHINY OBVIOUS WINDOW-DRESSING ON DEEPER PREJUDICES DEFICIENCIES AND ABSENCES.

IF PEOPLE ARE CONDITIONED TO LIVE THEIR LIVES BASED ON WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK OF THEM THAT??S A REALLY HEAVY WAY TO LIVE. ??ON SOME LEVEL IT??S REALLY DARK AND UNSATISFYING TO ME. I JUST KNOW I??M HAPPY. I??M THRILLED WITH THE LIFE I GET TO LIVE.

THERE SHOULD BE BLACK AND LGBT HEROES AND VILLAINS THERE SHOULD BE BLACK AND LGBT LEAD CHARACTERS SECONDARY CHARACTERS??AND WHEN POSSIBLE BLACK AND LGBT-FOCUSED STORIES THEMSELVES. THERE SHOULD BE OPENLY GAY ACTORS PLAYING STRAIGHT AND STRAIGHT PLAYING GAY. HOLLYWOOD WILL NOD ALONG VIGOROUSLY RETURN TO THEIR OFFICES AND ASK: HOW CAN WE MAKE THESE FILMS IF NO ONE WILL COME TO WATCH THEM? BUT AUDIENCES WILL IF THE STORIES ARE COMPELLINGLY TOLD. AND IF HOLLYWOOD AGAIN DUCKS ITS HEAD TO SAY IT IS ONLY RESPONDING TO AUDIENCE DEMAND AND AUDIENCES SIMPLY DO NOT WANT THIS??THEY WOULD RATHER HAVE CGI ROBOTS INDULGING IN WITTY REPARTEE AND HALF-WEREWOLVES AND ACTION HEROES??THEN ONE WOULD HAVE TO ASK HOW THIS CYCLE OF DEMAND AND EXPECTATION IS BEING PRODUCED AND PERPETUATED. OF COURSE IT IS ALL HOLLYWOOD??S WHACKO CODE MACHINE: IT BOTH PROPAGATES AND CONSUMES A UNITARY DIET. THE BEAST CREATES EATS THEN REGURGITATES ITS OWN CINEMATIC BONEMEAL. IT MATTERS THAT THE ACADEMY SAYS IT WILL CHANGE THE COMPOSITION AND COMPLEXION OF OSCAR VOTERS. BUT FOR WHAT WILL THEY BE VOTING? AS THE DEBATE OVER DIVERSITY CONTINUES TO BUBBLE??AND AS ACTORS ASKED THIS YEAR??S URGENT ??DIVERSITY??

A LACK OF BLACK AND OPENLY GAY FACES ON AWARDS??

IN REAL LIFE A POST-BENGHAZI INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT AMBASSADOR STEVENS HAD WIRED WASHINGTON IN JULY TO REQUEST A MINIMUM OF 13 SECURITY PERSONNEL AS HE TRAVELED TO BENGHAZI WHERE SAFE CONDITIONS HAD DETERIORATED. CLINTON DEPUTY PATRICK KENNEDY REPORTEDLY DENIED THE REQUEST. ??[STEVENS] HAD REGULAR CONTACT WITH MY AIDES. HE DID NOT RAISE SECURITY WITH ME? CLINTON TESTIFIED IN OCTOBER??S HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON BENGHAZI PUBLIC HEARING. ??AND THE SECURITY QUESTIONS AND REQUESTS WERE HANDLED BY THE SECURITY PROFESSIONALS.? STEVENS WAS GIVEN JUST TWO BODYGUARDS. NEITHER OF THEM WERE ABLE TO SAVE THE AMBASSADOR WHO DIED OF SMOKE INHALATION ALONG WITH SMITH IN THE FIRST WAVE OF THE BENGHAZI ATTACKS. THE FILM DOESN??T GIVE THE LATE STEVENS MUCH OF A CHANCE TO PROTEST HIS OWN SECURITY CONDITIONS IN BENGHAZI PORTRAYING THE DIPLOMAT INSTEAD AS BEING SO BLITHELY UNWORRIED BY THE GROWING DANGERS IN THE AREA THAT HE INSISTED ON STAYING IN AN ORNATE 9-ACRE VILLA THAT FAILED TO MEET STATE SECURITY STANDARDS ON MULTIPLE COUNTS. THE GRS GUYS CLEARLY SPOT HUGE SECURITY RISKS BUT AMBASSADOR STEVENS AND HIS PRIVATE DETAIL WAVE OFF DANGER. BESIDES THEY??RE TOLD THE GOVERNMENT??S TIGHT DIPLOMATIC BUDGET DOESN??T ALLOW THEM TO SPEND ON THE PROPER SECURITY PROVISIONS.

THE FILM??S CARTOONISHLY WRITTEN CIA CHIEF INSISTS THERE??S NO THREAT IN BENGHAZI AND HIS CONDESCENSION FOR THE GRS CONTRACTORS RUBS OFF ON HIS STAFF OF SNOBBY EGGHEAD CIA ANALYSTS. WHEN HEAVILY-ARMED MILITIAS HANDILY STORM THE UNDER-SECURED VILLA WHERE STEVENS IS STAYING SCATTERING THE UNDERPAID LOCAL GUNMEN HIRED TO KEEP HOSTILES OUT EVERYONE IS CAUGHT WOEFULLY UNDERSECURED UNDERPREPARED AND UNDERARMED. BOB FREEZES WAITING FOR PERMISSION FROM ABOVE THAT WILL NEVER COME. THOSE TRAPPED IN THE CIA ANNEX WAIT FOR AMERICAN RESCUE AND AIR SUPPORT THAT WILL NEVER COME. LESS THAN A MILE AWAY THE GRS SQUAD IS READY TO GO IN MINUTES BUT BOB ORDERS THEM TO STAND DOWN EVEN AS THEY AND BOB??S BOSSES HEAR THE HEARTBREAKING PLEAS COMING OVER THE COMMS: ??WE ARE OVERRUN. WE NEED IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE. WE NEED SOME FUCKING HELP.? BAY??S FRENETIC ACTION SEQUENCES ARE TERRIFYING AND DIZZYING EVEN IF CHOPPY EDITING MAKES THE CHAOS UNINTELLIGIBLE.

THE LATEST ITERATION OF BRAVO??S FRANCHISE OF DRINKING BITCHING AND ONEUPMANSHIP DOES NOT BREAK ANY MOULD. THE REAL HOUSEWIVES OF THE POTOMAC IS LIKE ??NEW YORK?? ??ATLANTA?? ??ORANGE COUNTY?? NEW JERSEY?? AND ??BEVERLY HILLS?? FEATURING A GROUP OF WOMEN LIVING ASTONISHINGLY EMPTY-SEEMING EXISTENCES THAT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO FEEL ARE GLAMOROUS AND SOMETHING TO ASPIRE TO. LIKE THE ??ATLANTA?? GROUP THIS ONE IS ALL-BLACK AND BI-RACIAL??WHICH RAISES THE FIRST AND AS YET UNANSWERED QUESTION OF WHY IS A SHOW SET IN POTOMAC ALL BLACK OR BIRACIAL WOMEN? THERE MAY INDEED BE A GROUP OF UPPER AND UPPER MIDDLE CLASS BLACK WOMEN IN THE POTOMAC AREA AND DC SUBURBS. BUT ONE OF THE WOMEN IN THIS SHOW SAYS THAT THEY ARE IN THE MINORITY THEMSELVES. YET THE SHOW ISN??T MIXED AND EVEN WITH ITS RACE NUCLEUS ACKNOWLEDGED NEITHER IS IT AN EXAMINATION OF WHY THE WOMEN FLOAT IN THEIR OWN PETTY BITCHY UNIVERSE. IT??S NOT AS IF THEY DON??T SOCIALIZE WITH WHITE WOMEN: THE LATTER ARE SHOWN TO BE FELLOW GUESTS AT A PARTY GOSSIPING AND SMILING FLUTTERINGLY. SO WHY CONCEIVE THE SHOW AS AN ALL-BLACK SHOW WITHOUT EXAMINING THE MECHANICS OF RACE AND EXCLUSION AS PART OF THE NARRATIVE? IS THIS ENCLAVE-WITHIN-AN-ENCLAVE SELF-SELECTED AND SUSTAINED ON THE PART OF THE WOMEN OR CRUELLY IMPOSED UPON THEM? OR BOTH? OR NEITHER? SINCE THE FAILURE OF ITS ??DC?? AND MIAMI SERIES BRAVO SEEMS INCAPABLE OF CASTING A MIXED ??HOUSEWIFE?? SHOW. WITH ??POTOMAC?? PEEL BACK THE FAMILIAR PARADE OF FAST RETORTS ANGUISHED CLOSE-UPS AND GLAMOROUS FROCKS AND YOU SEEM TO HAVE A SHOW CONCEIVED TO SHOW A COLLECTIVE OF WOMEN FIGHTING WITH EACH OTHER FOR SOCIAL SUPREMACY USING ALL THE INSIDIOUS MECHANICS OF EXCLUSION AND STIGMATIZATION THAT RACISM ITSELF??AT LEAST IN PART??OPERATES BY. FIRST THERE IS GIZELLE WHO PROUDLY TELLS US HER FATHER WAS ONE OF THE FIRST BLACK MEMBERS OF THE TEXAS HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. HER HUSBAND WAS A CHEATER SHE HAS TWIN DAUGHTERS AND THE ONLY BOOK OF ETIQUETTE SHE OBEYED WAS HER OWN SHE SAYS. THERE IS SOMETHING ODDLY STEPFORD ABOUT NOT JUST ??POTOMAC?? BUT ALL THE OTHER PLACES WHERE THE ??HOUSEWIVES?? BLOOM LIKE ALGAE. THEY BANG ON ABOUT MANNERS AND ETIQUETTE AND INFRACTIONS OF THESE THINGS AND THEN INVARIABLY END UP RIPPING OUT EACH OTHER??S HAIR EXTENSIONS AND SPEAKING OVER EACH OTHER TO TRY AND VOICE THE BEST PUNCHLINE OR PUTDOWN TO A CONFRONTATION. ONE MUST KNOW WHERE TO SIT AT A PARTY BUT??TWO HOURS IN??IF YOU WANT TO PUSH SOMEONE INTO A POOL FEEL FREE. THE GIZELLE INTRO WAS CLEAR: SHE WAS GOING TO HAVE AN ??ETIQUETTE?? STORYLINE. KATIE MEANWHILE ??LOVES THE WHITE BOYS? AND ??THE JEWISH BOYS? IN PARTICULAR. SHE IS FROM A ??FAMOUS FAMILY OF PHILANTHROPISTS? AND IS CONSERVATIVE SO HER FAMILY DOES NOT LIKE HER BEING UNMARRIED??HER SQUEEZE THE WHITE AND JEWISH ANDREW DOESN??T WANT TO RUSH INTO THAT. FOR KATIE NOT BEING MARRIED ??IS NOT A GOOD LOOK.? SHE COULDN??T IMAGINE WHY ANDREW WOULDN??T WANT TO MARRY HER WHAT WASN??T THERE TO LOVE SHE ASKED KITTENISHLY. THE NON-KITTENISH RESPONSE FROM THIS VIEWER WAS: MAYBE HE WANTS MORE FROM THE RELATIONSHIP THAN JUST TO FEEL LIKE A FETISHIZED ROMANCE OBJECT AND WANTS TO MAKE SURE THE RELATIONSHIP HAS A PROPER FOUNDATION. JUST A GUESS KATIE: YOU??RE WELCOME. ROBYN SAID SHE WAS A FREE SPIRIT A PR DOING UNSPECIFIED PR-Y THINGS. SHE WAS READY TO THROW OUT HER WEDDING DRESS AFTER GETTING DIVORCED FROM HER HUSBAND JUAN. HOWEVER JUAN AND ROBYN STILL LIVED TOGETHER SLEPT TOGETHER AND RAISED THEIR CHILDREN TOGETHER AND SO WAS NATURALLY SURPRISED TO RETURN HOME AND FIND HER WEARING HER WEDDING DRESS AS SHE HAD BEEN EGGED ON TO DO BY GIZELLE. INTERSPERSED WITH THESE INTRODUCTIONS WERE PICTURES OF THE POTOMAC RIVER TENNIS AND GOLF CLUBS AND MANSIONS. THE MANSIONS I THINK ARE SUPPOSED TO LOOK LUXURIOUS BUT REALLY LOOK LIKE GATED PRISONS. AND LIKE OTHER ??HOUSEWIFE?? FRANCHISES THE WOMEN LURCH LISTLESSLY FROM ONE MANSION TO ANOTHER GOSSIPING IN WAYS THAT SEEM WHOLLY ARTIFICIAL. THE QUESTION THAT PERSISTS IS LESS: WHO ARE THESE WOMEN BUT WHAT DO THEY DO? 'POTOMAC?? SEEMS ESPECIALLY BIZARRE AS WE KNOW AT THE OUTSET THE BLACK WOMEN ARE AN ENCLAVE WITHIN AN ENCLAVE AND SO THE REAL QUESTION ALREADY IS??DO THEY CIRCULATE WITH THE WHITE WOMEN WE SEE AS PERIPHERAL AND IF THEY DO NOT WHAT ARE THE MECHANICS OF RACIAL EXCLUSION WHETHER IMPOSED OR SELF-ELECTING THAT OPERATE HERE? NO TIME FOR SUCH DEEP-AND-MEANINGFULS KIDS BECAUSE NEXT IT WAS TIME TO MEET KAREN. KAREN IS MARRIED TO RAY ??THE BLACK BILL GATES? WHOSE JOB AND ROLE REMAINED UNDEFINED. KAREN APPEARS TO BE A MEGA-SNOB AND MEGA-MATERIALISTIC??IRONIC AS SHE HERSELF IS A FARMER??S DAUGHTER. IT??S NOT THAT MONEY IS EVERYTHING SHE SAYS BUT SHE HAS YET TO MEET A HAPPY POOR MAN. AFTER 19 YEARS OF MARRIAGE SHE SAID SHE ??HAD TO KEEP IT COMING.? SHE SAID SHE WAS AWARE OTHER WOMEN WERE READY TO MOVE IN FOR HER HUSBAND AND SHE WAS READY TO TAKE ON ALL-COMERS AT THE PALACE GATES. KAREN SPOKE WITH THE AIRY TONES OF THE GRANDE DAME AND GIZELLE SAID SHE WAS ??THE DIVA?: DIANA ROSS AND PATTI LABELLE ROLLED INTO ONE. KAREN SAID SOMETHING ABOUT WANTING TO PASS THE REINS ON TO THE NEXT GENERATION OF BLACK WOMEN AS IF SHE WAS THE QUEEN OF SOME KIND OF SOME KIND OF PRINCIPALITY PREPARING TO ELECT HER HEIR OR HEIRS. DESPITE THE THICK FOG OF ABSURDITY AROUND HER KAREN??S SURNAME I NOTED WAS ??HUBER?? JUST LIKE MRS. HUBER??THE HIDEOUSLY NOSY NEIGHBOR OF DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES. KAREN SEEMED MUCH MORE KEEN TO EXCLUDE OTHER BLACK WOMEN AND JUDGE THEM THAN HELP THEM: ONE OF THOSE KINDS OF PEOPLE WHO AFTER GAINING ENTRY INTO WHATEVER TIER OF SOCIETY THEY HAVE AIMED FOR QUICKLY PULLS THE DRAWBRIDGE UP BEHIND HER. GIZELLE ADMITTED TO BEING ??A LITTLE JUDGED? BY KAREN AND SO THE FIRST ANIMOSITY OF THE SERIES WAS SOWN. THIS BEGAN WHEN CHARISSE WHOSE SPORTS MANAGER HUSBAND DIDN??T LIVE AT HOME (AND WAS WIDELY SUSPECTED TO BE MORE THAN PRACTICALLY ABSENT FROM THEIR MARRIAGE AS SHE CLAIMED) THREW A BIRTHDAY PARTY FOR KAREN AND GIZELLE OCCUPIED THE ??CENTER SEAT.?? THIS WAS APPARENTLY SIMPLY NOT ??DONE?? IN POTOMAC. HOW EXHAUSTING IT MUST BE TO LIVE THERE??I??M SO GLAD TO BE LIVING IN NEW YORK WHERE I WILL GLADLY TAKE ANY OF THE LADIES TO THE MALIBU DINER AT 23RD AND 7TH WHERE THE ONLY MANNERS INFRACTION IS TO BE RUDE TO ONE OF THE STAFF AND WHERE THE ??DONE?? THING IS TO EAT ONE??S BAGEL EITHER CHATTING AMIABLY TO A COMPANION OR DELICIOUSLY SILENT ON YOUR OWN WITH BOOK OR NEWSPAPER. THIS RUMBLING RESENTMENT OVER THE CENTER SEAT ISSUE??KAREN WAS STILL KIND OF CENTER DEPENDING ON THE CAMERA ANGLE??EXPLODED AS EVERY ??HOUSEWIFE?? CONFRONTATION TENDS TO AT A PARTY IN THIS CASE A CRAB BOIL AT CHARISSE??S. FIRST THERE WAS OUTRAGE THAT GIZELLE HAD BOUGHT HER HAIR STYLIST. ??WHO ON EARTH WALKS AROUND WITH THE HELP AT A PRIVATE EVENT?? QUERIED KAREN WITH WITHERING DISGUST. THERE WAS A REFERENCE TO GIZELLE??S BEHAVIOR BEING APPROPRIATE ??IN THE GHETTO NOT THE POTOMAC.? THEN KAREN TOLD GIZELLE HOW OFFENDED SHE HAD BEEN AT HER SITTING AT THE CENTER OF THE TABLE AT HER BIRTHDAY DO PRESENTING HER WITH A LIST OF POTOMAC ETIQUETTE RULES WHICH WERE AS ASININE AS YOU WOULD EXPECT THEM TO BE. IF GIZELLE EVER CAME TO A FUNCTION OF HERS SAID KAREN SHE SHOULD BE MINDFUL OF THE RULES. WITH THE AWARENESS OF THEMSELVES AS A MINORITY CAME THE VERY OPPOSITE TO AWARENESS AND EMPATHY AROUND SURMOUNTING RESTRICTIONS AND RIDICULOUS HURTFUL ??RULES.?? INSTEAD THE WOMEN GLEEFULLY PRACTICED ALL THE TRICKS AND TRAPS OF SUPERIORITY THAT MAKES OTHER PEOPLE??S LIVES MISERABLE. HOW MUCH FUN TO BE THE OPPRESSORS IN HEELS WIGS AND FULL MAKE-UP! WHAT WONDERFUL PROGRESS. A PORTMANTEAU OF SCENES FROM FUTURE SHOWS SHOWED THE USUAL??ROWS RAUCOUS PARTIES SUPPOSED LUXURY AND EXCESS SOMETHING SCREECHY AND FLEETINGLY CATACLYSMIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC SWELLING TO A BOMBASTIC SMASH. THERE IS NOTHING NEW IN THE ??HOUSEWIVES OF POTOMAC'??JUST THE USUAL CONFECTED BITCHING IN BRIGHTLY COLORED DRESSES EVEN IF IT RAISES MORE OFF-CAMERA QUESTIONS ABOUT RACE AND PRIVILEGE THAN IT INTENDS. AT THE END OF THE HOUR ALL SQUAWKING AND SCRAPPING ABATED THE SAME QUESTION GNAWS THROUGH THE GLITTER: WHO WOULD ASPIRE TO THIS? DO WE WANT ANY OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ESPECIALLY OUR DAUGHTERS TO ASPIRE TO THIS? THESE ARE THE ETERNAL ??HOUSEWIFE?? QUESTIONS WHATEVER THE CITY. WHY THIS ENCLAVE WITHIN AN ENCLAVE ON THE POTOMAC HAS BEEN CHOSEN AS THE LATEST BRAVO PETRI DISH FOR THEM TO BE ENACTED IS AS YET A MYSTERY AND ALREADY AN INTRIGUING ONE IF NOT FOR THE REASONS ITS PRODUCERS INTEND. ,29506.0

777,10032610.0,2016-01-18T05:01:00+00:00, WHY ??MEIN KAMPF?? IS A MUST-READ NOW,ONE OF THE WELCOME DEVELOPMENTS OF THE NEW YEAR IS THE REPUBLICATION IN GERMANY FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE WORLD WAR II OF??YES GULP??MEIN KAMPF. ADOLF HITLER??S AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL MANIFESTO WAS RE-RELEASED IN A NEW HIGHLY ANNOTATED ACADEMIC EDITION IN GERMAN. WITH 3500 FOOTNOTES AND NEARLY 2000 PAGES IN TWO VOLUMES THE NEW BOOK IS MORE THAN TWICE AS LONG AS HITLER??S 782-PAGE ORIGINAL. WITHHELD FROM PUBLICATION FOR SEVEN DECADES FOR FEAR THAT IT MIGHT STIR UP NEO-NAZIS OR TARNISH GERMANY??S INTERNATIONAL IMAGE HITLER??S CONVOLUTED ANTI-SEMITIC MEMOIR IS BACK IN PRINT IN THE LAND OF ITS ORIGIN BECAUSE ITS COPYRIGHT HAS JUST RUN OUT. SINCE JANUARY 1 ONE OF THE WORLD??S MOST NOTORIOUS BOOKS HAS BEEN IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN. AND WHILE THE REISSUE OF HITLER??S ANTI-SEMITIC RANT IS DENOUNCED BY SOME ESPECIALLY WITHIN THE JEWISH HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR COMMUNITY IT IS BEING GREETED ENTHUSIASTICALLY BY THE GREAT MAJORITY OF SCHOLARS INCLUDING JEWISH INTELLECTUALS IN THE U.S. ISRAEL AND GERMANY. EVEN THE HEAD OF THE CENTRAL COUNCIL OF JEWS IN GERMANY JOSEF SCHUSTER HAS WELCOMED THE ISSUANCE OF THE ANNOTATED BOOK BY MUNICH??S RESPECTED INSTITUTE FOR CONTEMPORARY HISTORY. ??THERE ARE NO OBJECTIONS TO A SCIENTIFICALLY ANNOTATED EDITION? HE SAID. THAT IS AS IT SHOULD BE. IT??S TIME FOR THE LONG-TABOO BOOK TO FACE THE HARSH LIGHT OF COMMON SCRUTINY BY A GERMAN PUBLIC THAT IS THREE GENERATIONS REMOVED FROM THE WAR. AND IT IS HIGH TIME EVEN LONG OVERDUE THAT GERMAN SCHOOLCHILDREN AND UNIVERSITY STUDENTS HAVE THE BENEFIT OF DIRECT ACCESS TO THE EARLY RAW MATERIAL OF HITLER??S MADNESS JUST AS THEY HAVE LONG BEEN ABLE TO READ HIS SPEECHES AND SEE HIM PERFORM IN OLD FILM CLIPS. THOUGH YOUNG READERS COULD ALSO FIND MEIN KAMPF ON THE INTERNET OR PERHAPS IN THEIR GRANDPARENTS?? ATTICS THE BOOK HAS FOR SEVEN DECADES LIVED A SHADOW EXISTENCE AS A CONTRABAND ITEM THAT WAS TOO HOT TO TOUCH. THE BOOK OR EVEN SIGNIFICANT EXCERPTS FROM IT HAVE NEVER BEEN PART OF THE GERMAN SCHOOL CURRICULUM??EVEN THOUGH POSTWAR GERMANY??S FIRST PRESIDENT THEODOR HEUSS RECOMMENDED JUST SUCH A STEP IN 1959. NOW SAYS GERMANY??S EDUCATION MINISTER JOHANNA WANKA MEIN KAMPF CAN BE TAUGHT IN THE SCHOOLS BECAUSE ??HITLER??S STATEMENTS WILL NO LONGER BE UNCONTRADICTED.? FEARS THAT HITLER??S FEVERISH BUT RAMBLING AND REPETITIVE WRITING WOULD SOMEHOW INCITE A NEO-NAZI REVIVAL ARE DISMISSED BY MOST OBSERVERS. THE PURE TEXT HAS FOR YEARS BEEN POSTED ON EXTREMIST RIGHT-WING WEBSITES IN GERMAN AND OTHER LANGUAGES AND HAS NOT YET TRIGGERED A FASCIST GROUNDSWELL. SUCH GERMAN XENOPHOBIA AS EXISTS TODAY IS MORE LIKELY TO BE DIRECTED AT SYRIAN REFUGEES THAN CHANNELED THROUGH HITLER??S OBSESSION WITH JEWS. FOR CONTEMPORARY READERS OF ANY POLITICAL PERSUASION DIGGING INTO HITLER??S OVERHEATED SIMPLISTIC THEORIES OF RACIAL DOMINATION AND HIS TANGLED ??20S FOREIGN POLICY PRESCRIPTIONS IS MORE IN THE NATURE OF HISTORICAL HOMEWORK THAN POLITICAL INSPIRATION. BUT THE HOMEWORK IS IMPORTANT AND THAT??S WHAT MAKES THE ARRIVAL OF THE NEW ??CRITICAL EDITION? OF MEIN KAMPF A POSITIVE STEP. CLOSETING THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT ORIGINAL SOURCE OF THE NAZI ENTERPRISE IS HARDLY THE WAY TO EDUCATE AND INOCULATE FUTURE GERMAN GENERATIONS ABOUT THEIR COUNTRY??S DARKEST HOUR. PUTTING THE ACADEMIC IMPRIMATUR ON THE BEAST SOMEHOW TAMES IT CONVERTING IT FROM INFLAMMATORY POLITICAL PAMPHLET TO INTERESTING HISTORICAL ARTIFACT. NOW IT CAN BE TAUGHT FOR WHAT IT IS. AND TEACHING IS THE KEY. HITLER??S ORIGINAL AGGRESSIVELY MARKETED BY HIS MUNICH PUBLISHER SOLD MORE THAN 12 MILLION COPIES BUT THE MUNICH SCHOLARS OPENLY HOPED THEIR BOOK PRICED AT $64 A SET WOULD NOT BECOME A BESTSELLER??THE NEW EDITION HAS AN INITIAL PRINT RUN OF ONLY 4000. IT IS DESIGNED FOR LIBRARIES RESEARCHERS AND TEACHERS. ??THE BOOK WILL GET A MULTIPLIER EFFECT THROUGH ACADEMIC USE AND THE MEDIA? COMMENTS HISTORIAN CHRISTIAN HARTMANN THE SCHOLAR IN CHARGE OF THE PROJECT. WITH THE FOOTNOTES SNAKING THROUGHOUT THE TEXT THE NEW MEIN KAMPF MORE CLOSELY RESEMBLES A THEOLOGICAL TREATISE THAN A POLITICAL TRACT. ??IRONICALLY [THE NEWLY ANNOTATED ??MEIN KAMPF??] WILL LOOK LIKE THE TALMUD? NOTED DAN MICHMAN HEAD OF INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH AT YAD VASHEM MUSEUM IN ISRAEL. THE TALMUDIC ANALOGY FLOWS FROM THE DECISION BY THE MEIN KAMPF ACADEMIC TEAM TO ??ENCIRCLE? HITLER??S WORDS WITH THE ANALYTICAL AND DECONSTRUCTING FOOTNOTES. ??WE WANTED TO SURROUND THE TEXT TO DEMYSTIFY IT AND DESTROY IT? SAYS HARTMANN. SINCE 2009 HIS TEAM OF FIVE SCHOLARS??WITH HELP FROM SEVERAL DOZEN OTHERS??HAS TRACED AND DISSECTED THE ORIGINS OF HITLER??S COMPLEX SOMETIMES OUTRAGEOUS THINKING ALMOST SENTENCE-BY-SENTENCE. SINCE HITLER WROTE ONLY IN THE OMNISCIENT VOICE AND ALMOST NEVER ATTRIBUTED IDEAS TO ANYONE (AND PROVIDED NO FOOTNOTES AT ALL) THE TASK HAS BEEN MONUMENTAL. HITLER??S TEXT NEEDED DECONSTRUCTING NOT SIMPLY BECAUSE IT IS OFFENSIVE AND INFLAMMATORY. IT IS ALSO DENSE CONVOLUTED AND FILLED WITH OBSCURE REFERENCES. WRITING THE FIRST VOLUME OF HIS BOOK IN 1924 IN A SMALL PRISON CELL OUTSIDE MUNICH??WHERE HE WAS SERVING TIME FOR THE ABORTIVE 1923 BEER HALL PUTSCH??HITLER WALLOWED IN THE COMMON ??TRUTHS HALF-TRUTHS AND LIES? OF SOCIAL DARWINISM OF THE LATE 19TH CENTURY AND EARLY 20TH CENTURY SAYS HARTMANN. WHEN I VISITED THAT CELL IN 2015 (THE INTERNAL WALLS ARE GONE BUT THE WINDOWS WHERE HITLER STOOD FOR AN ICONIC PHOTOGRAPH ARE EXACTLY THE SAME) I COULD VISUALIZE THE ??SMALL LIBRARY? HITLER HAD ALONG ONE WALL WHERE HE DREW ON THE RANDOM WRITINGS OF THE DAY FOR HIS RACIST IDEAS. HITLER PASTED TOGETHER STREWN DATA AND TENDENTIOUS NOTIONS FOR HIS OWN PURPOSES WITH NO DOCUMENTATION OR EVEN THE SLIGHTEST ATTEMPT TO PERSUADE READERS OF THEIR VERACITY. WHERE HE DISCOVERED HIS OVERSIMPLIFIED CONSTRUCTS??ABOUT ??THE PATH OF THE JEWS? FOR EXAMPLE??AND WHY HE DWELT AT LENGTH ON SUCH TOPICS AS ??THE ART OF READING? AND ON STAMPING OUT SYPHILIS (??THE TASK OF THE NATION?) ARE ALL SUBJECTS OF THE SCHOLARLY INQUIRY AND THE COMMENTARY. BUT THE DECISION TO PUBLISH THE BOOK WAS NOT ENTIRELY ACADEMIC. ANTICIPATING THE EXPIRATION OF THE BOOK??S COPYRIGHT??HELD SINCE 1945 BY THE STATE OF BAVARIA WHICH REFUSED REPUBLICATION ON POLITICAL GROUNDS??THE HISTORIANS AND OTHER CIVIL SOCIETY ACTORS INCLUDING JEWISH AND CATHOLIC GROUPS SOUGHT TO STEAL A MARCH ON POTENTIAL EXPLOITERS OF THE COPYRIGHT-FREE BOOK BY COMMISSIONING THE ACADEMIC VERSION??AND HAVING IT READY BY THE CRACK OF 2016. THEY FEARED THAT ALLOWING MEIN KAMPF TO BE ISSUED BY A NEO-NAZI GROUP OR A COMMERCIAL PUBLISHER SEEKING A QUICK-BUCK SENSATION WOULD HAVE ONCE AGAIN TARRED GERMANY??S IMAGE. BETTER TO DO THE DEED AT THE HIGHEST AND MOST SOBER LEVELS REASONED THE RESEARCHERS. (THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS ENQUIRIES BY FOREIGN PUBLISHERS THOUGH NO TRANSLATION HAS YET BEGUN.) WHILE THE LIFTING OF ONE OF THE LAST POSTWAR PROHIBITIONS IN GERMANY HAS TO BE SEEN AS A SIGN OF CIVIC MATURITY GERMANS ARE STILL TO SOME EXTENT AFRAID OF THEIR OWN SHADOWS. THE CONFERENCE OF STATE JUSTICE MINISTERS WHO ENFORCE LAWS LIKE INCITEMENT TO HATRED HAVE SAID THEY WILL PROSECUTE ANYONE WHO PUBLISHES A NON-ANNOTATED VERSION OF MEIN KAMPF.

DIETRICH ONE OF THREE LESBIAN BARS IN MOSCOW WAS SNATCHED FROM ITS OWNER IN BROAD DAYLIGHT THE LATEST SIGN THAT GAYS AND LESBIANS HERE ARE BEING TURNED INTO SECOND-CLASS CITIZENS. AT 6 P.M. ON DECEMBER 10 THE CLUB??S LANDLORD RAN INTO THE CLUB AND SHOUTED ??THE PETROVKA [MOSCOW??S POLICE] IS ON THEIR WAY HERE NOW! EVERYBODY GET OUT!? EUGENIA DEBRYANSKAYA DIETRICH??S OWNER AND FOUNDER THREW THE KEYS TO MAKSIM KOZLOUVSKIY THE LANDLORD AND FLED. BUT THE POLICE NEVER CAME. INSTEAD KOZLOUVSKIY AND SECURITY GUARDS CHANGED THE LOCKS AND TOOK POSSESSION OF A SMALL FORTUNE??S WORTH OF STEREO EQUIPMENT AND ALCOHOL. THE NEXT DAY KOZLOUVSKIY CALLED DEBRYANSKAYA AND INVITED HER TO MEET HIM AT THE MCDONALD??S ON PUSHKIN SQUARE. THERE HE TOLD A SURPRISED DEBRYANSKAYA THAT DESPITE THEIR ONGOING 12-YEAR CONTRACT WHICH WAS DUE FOR RENEWAL ON JANUARY 1 OF 2016 HE WAS TAKING OVER THE LESBIAN BAR TO START A ??NATURAL NIGHTCLUB.?? DEBRYANSKAYA PROTESTED BUT KOZLOUVSKIY REPLIED THAT AS THE LANDLORD HE OWNED EVERYTHING IN THE BUILDING. ??YOU ARE NOBODY? DEBRYANSKAYA RECALLED HIM SAYING. HE WAS WRONG ABOUT THAT THOUGH. DEBRYANSKAYA IS A LEADING ACTIVIST IN MOSCOW??S LGBT COMMUNITY. IN 1990 SHE AND ROMAN KALINI HELD IN PRESS CONFERENCE TO DECLARE THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST LGBT RIGHTS MOVEMENT IN RUSSIA AND SUBSEQUENTLY STARTED THE ??ASSOCIATION OF SEXUAL MINORITIES.?? IN 2006 SHE WAS ARRESTED IN FRONT OF THE MOSCOW CITY HALL DURING A PRIDE PARADE. DEBRYANSKAYA 62 KNOWS THE LAW AND SAID SHE HESITATED TO LEAVE THE CLUB THAT NIGHT. ??MY BUSINESS IS LEGAL WHY SHOULD I BE AFRAID OF PETROVKA??? SHE CLAIMS TO HAVE ASKED KOZLOUVSKIY AT THE TIME. KOZLOUVSKIY ASSURED HER THAT HE ONLY WANTED TO PROTECT HER FROM UNNECESSARY TROUBLE WITH THE AUTHORITIES. RUSSIAN GAY CLUBS ARE LEGAL AS LONG AS THE CLIENTELE IS OVER THE AGE OF 18. AND DIETRICH SEEMED PARTICULARLY SAFE. HIDDEN FROM THE MAIN STREET BEHIND FLASHY BARS LIKE DYXLESS AND NOOR BAR VISITORS HAD TO BE PERSISTENT IN THE FACE OF CHALLENGES LIKE TRYING TO FIND THE RIGHT CELLAR DOOR IN AN EMPTY AND SILENT COURTYARD. (EITHER DIETRICH??S SOUND SYSTEM WAS TOO SOFT OR ITS WALLS TOO SOUNDPROOF.) ??WE WERE INVISIBLE?? DEBRYANSKAYA SAID. AUTHORITIES ARE UNLIKELY TO SHUTTER LGBT NIGHTSPOTS BUT THEY WON??T INTERFERE WITH ANYONE WHO DOES SO ON THEIR OWN. THAT??S WHY WHEN I ASKED DEBRYANSKAYA IF SHE WAS GOING TO THE POLICE SHE LAUGHED AT ME WITH HER SMOKER??S VOICE. ??I COMPLAIN? SHE SAID. ??BUT I AM SURE THEY WILL DO NOTHING.? THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THINGS HAVE GOTTEN MORE DIFFICULT FOR RUSSIA??S LGBT POPULATION SINCE THE 2013 INTRODUCTION OF THE LGBT ??PROPAGANDA LAW.? THE LAW MAKES IT ILLEGAL TO USE THE INTERNET OR MEDIA TO PROMOTE ??NON-TRADITIONAL RELATIONS.?? ITS ADVOCATES JUSTIFY IT WITH THE NEED TO ??PROTECT CHILDREN?? AND AID THE SURVIVAL OF TRADITIONAL FAMILY VALUES. TWO YEARS AGO MOSCOW??S OLDEST GAY CLUB BODY AND SOUL WAS SUDDENLY SHUT DOWN TWO YEARS AGO BECAUSE OF PRESSURE FROM OLEG MITVOL A ??MORAL CAMPAIGNER.? WHEN THEY WEREN??T SHUTTING THEM DOWN POLICE HAVE ROUTINELY IGNORED ATTACKS ON GAY CLUBS IN MOSCOW. TAKE THE ORDEAL OF CENTRAL STATION FOR EXAMPLE. IN 2014 A FEW MEN SPRAYED TEAR GAS INTO RUSSIA??S LARGEST GAY CLUB ON ONE NIGHT SMASHED EQUIPMENT ON ANOTHER AND FIRED GUNSHOTS AND BEAT UP PARTYGOERS IN BETWEEN. CENTRAL STATION??S OWNER LISHCHINSKY MADE 30 COMPLAINTS TO THE POLICE AND ALL OF THEM WERE IGNORED. EVENTUALLY THE CLUB HAD TO CLOSE AND LISHCHINSKY REQUESTED ASYLUM IN THE USA. OF COURSE PETROVKA??S UNRELIABILITY IS NOT EXCLUSIVELY RESERVED FOR THE LGBT COMMUNITY THE POLICE ARE NOTORIOUSLY UNRELIABLE IN GENERAL. DEBRYANSKAYA FOUNDED THE BAR IN 2003 AS 12 VOLT. THEN THERE WAS MORE CLUBBING AND EVEN A ??KISSING ROOM.? THE CLUB GOT TAMER AS THE ENVIRONMENT GOT MORE HOSTILE AND LAST SUMMER SHE REBRANDED THE CLUB TO DIETRICH. THE NEW CONCEPT WAS ART EXHIBITIONS CONCERTS AND DINNER PARTIES. A NORMAL FRIDAY NIGHT AT DIETRICH WOULD INVOLVE WOMEN AND A FEW MEN IN TURTLENECK SWEATERS ??PRINKING? BY EATING PIZZA AND DRINKING WINE BEFORE GETTING DOWN TO SOME MICHAEL JACKSON AND KATY PERRY AROUND MIDNIGHT. THE DIETRICH FACEBOOK PAGE IS FLOODED WITH COMMENTS BY REGULARS. ??IF YOU WANT TO SPEND THE BEST YEARS OF YOUR LIFE IN COURT THEN GO TO THE AUTHORITIES.?? ANOTHER ONE CHEERFULLY READS ??SORRY?? LAWLESSNESS!?? GRIMMER POSTS READ SOMETHING LIKE ??AT LEAST IT WAS WITHOUT BLOODSHED.? DEBRYANSKAYA SAYS THAT SHE WILL FILE ANOTHER APPEAL TO THE POLICE EVEN IF IT IS ??ABSOLUTELY USELESS TO TRY AND DEFEND A GAY CLUB IN RUSSIA.?? SHE HAS ALL THE DOCUMENTS TO PROVE THAT SHE OWNS THE SOUND SYSTEM AND HAD PAID THE RENT ALL ALONG. SHE??S ALSO PLANNING A PRESS CONFERENCE AT A FRIEND??S EXHIBITION SPACE NEXT WEEKEND. HER HOPE IS THAT ??AFTER THE PRESS CONFERENCE MAYBE SOMEBODY WILL DEFEND US.?? I ASKED DEBRYANSKAYA WHETHER IF SHE DOESN??T GET HER CLUB BACK SHE WOULD START ANOTHER ONE? NO SHE SAID SHE IS 62 YEARS OLD NOW AND NEEDS REST. SHE WANTS TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH HER GRANDCHILDREN SHE SAID??BUT THEN SHE PAUSES. ??BUT I WOULD STILL THROW SOME BIG PARTIES.? ,6273.0

DUSTY EVENTUALLY REACHED HIS GRANDFATHER??S PICKUP TRUCK HE SAID AND RODE BACK TO THE RANCH. THEY ALL SAT DOWN TO A LUNCH OF EGG SALAD SANDWICHES. ??DWIGHT TOLD ME TO KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT THAT NOBODY NEEDED TO KNOW ABOUT THE FIRE? DUSTY TESTIFIED.

736,10012999.0,2016-01-17T05:00:00+00:00,DAVID BOWIE AND ROCK ??N?? ROLL??S STATUTORY RAPE PROBLEM ,SINCE THE DEATH OF DAVID BOWIE ON JANUARY 10TH FANS AND MEDIA HAVE DISSECTED MUCH OF HIS MUSICAL AND CULTURAL LEGACY. BOWIE STANDS AS A TOWERING FIGURE OVER THE LAST 45 YEARS OF MUSIC AND AS A CELEBRITY FAMOUS FOR AN EVER-CHANGING ENIGMATIC APPROACH TO HIS LIFE AND ART THERE IS MUCH TO BE ANALYZED IN THE WAKE OF HIS PASSING. BUT NOT ALL OF IT IS PLEASANT OR EVEN MUSICAL. ONE UNCOMFORTABLE FACET OF THE ICONIC ROCKER??S PAST HAS SUDDENLY BEEN THRUST INTO THE CENTER OF THE DIALOGUE AND IT??S RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT BOTH BOWIE AND THE WORLD THAT HAS ENABLED HIM AND SO MANY OTHERS. THE HIGH-PROFILE CONTROVERSIES SURROUNDING CONTEMPORARY STARS LIKE R. KELLY (WHO WAS FAMOUSLY ACCUSED OF STATUTORY RAPE AND TAKEN TO COURT ON CHILD PORNOGRAPHY CHARGES IN THE EARLY 2000S) AND THE BACKLASH AGAINST RAPPER TYGA (FOLLOWING HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH A THEN-UNDERAGE KYLIE JENNER) HAVE LED TO A BROADER DISCUSSION SURROUNDING LEGAL CONSENT AND ADULT MALE STARS WHO ENGAGE IN PREDATORY BEHAVIOR. AND SINCE HIS DEATH MORE FANS AND COMMENTATORS HAVE HAD TO QUESTION BOWIE??S OWN PAST WITH TEEN GIRLS AS WELL. IN A THRILLIST PIECE ENTITLED I LOST MY VIRGINITY TO DAVID BOWIE: CONFESSIONS OF A ??70S GROUPIE LORI MATTIX RECALLS A SEXUAL ENCOUNTER WITH BOWIE WHEN SHE WAS ONLY 14 YEARS OLD. ??HE FOCUSED HIS FAMOUSLY TWO-COLORED EYES ON ME AND SAID ??LORI DARLING CAN YOU COME WITH ME???? MATTIX RECALLED. ??HE WALKED ME THROUGH HIS BEDROOM AND INTO THE BATHROOM WHERE HE DROPPED HIS KIMONO. HE GOT INTO THE TUB ALREADY FILLED WITH WATER AND ASKED ME TO WASH HIM. OF COURSE I DID. THEN HE ESCORTED ME INTO THE BEDROOM GENTLY TOOK OFF MY CLOTHES AND DE-VIRGINIZED ME.? ROCK STAR ESCAPADES FROM THAT PERIOD HAVE BEEN GLAMORIZED FOR DECADES WITH NO REGARD FOR HOW DISTURBING OR ILLEGAL THE BEHAVIOR WAS. IT BECAME A PART OF THE MYTHOS??A DISGUSTING TESTAMENT TO HOW LITTLE THE WRITERS DOCUMENTING THE HAPPENINGS OF THE DAY CARED ABOUT TAKING THEIR HEROES TO TASK. AND IT WAS RIGHT THERE IN THE MUSIC ITSELF: THE ROLLING STONES SANG ABOUT UNDERAGE GIRLS IN ??STRAY CAT BLUES? AND CHUCK BERRY GLORIFIED THE TEENAGE ??GROUPIE? IN ??SWEET LITTLE SIXTEEN? A DECADE EARLIER. BUT WE CAN??T LOOK AT IT WITH THOSE SAME EYES TODAY??NOT IF WE ARE SINCERE ABOUT PROTECTING VICTIMS AND HOLDING CELEBRITIES ACCOUNTABLE. IT??S CONVENIENT TO GO AFTER TYGA AND R. KELLY WHEN WE SEE HASHTAGS OR TRENDING STORIES AND THEIR BEHAVIOR WARRANTS EVERY BIT OF SCRUTINY AND CRITICISM IT??S GOTTEN. BUT WE CANNOT WRITE OFF THE ALARMING BEHAVIOR OF SUPERSTARS PAST JUST BECAUSE THEY??RE NOW OLDER GREYER OR IN THE CASE OF BOWIE NEWLY-DEPARTED. BECAUSE THIS BEHAVIOR DIDN??T START WITH CONTEMPORARY HIP-HOP AND R&B ACTS. IN ADDITION TO HER TIME WITH BOWIE MATTIX WAS ALSO STATUTORY RAPED BY LED ZEPPELIN GUITARIST JIMMY PAGE. IN THE BOOK HAMMER OF THE GODS FORMER ZEPPELIN ROAD MANAGER RICHARD COLE CLAIMED THAT THE ROCKER TASKED HIM WITH KIDNAPPING THE TEEN GIRL. HE ALLEGEDLY ESCORTED HER FROM A NIGHTCLUB AND THRUST HER INTO THE BACK OF PAGE??S LIMO WITH THE WARNING OF STAY PUT OR ??I??LL HAVE YOUR HEAD.? PAGE KEPT MATTIX HIDDEN FOR THREE YEARS TO AVOID LEGAL TROUBLE. MATTIX STILL ROMANTICIZES HER EXPERIENCES WITH THESE VERY ADULT MEN (??IT WAS MAGNIFICENT. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? IT WAS JUST LIKE RIGHT OUT OF A STORY! KIDNAPPED MAN AT 14!? SHE STATED IN HAMMER OF THE GODS) BUT THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT WHAT BOTH PAGE AND BOWIE DID WAS UNACCEPTABLE. THAT IT WAS GLAMORIZED IN MAGAZINES LIKE CREEM AND GLOSSED OVER IN FILMS LIKE ALMOST FAMOUS SPEAKS TO CULTURAL IRRESPONSIBILITY. ??SWEET LITTLE SIXTEEN / SHE??S GOT THE GROWN-UP BLUES / TIGHT DRESSES AND LIPSTICK / SHE??S SPORTIN?? HIGH-HEEL SHOES / OH BUT TOMORROW MORNING / SHE??LL HAVE TO CHANGE HER TREND / AND BE SWEET SIXTEEN / AND BACK IN CLASS AGAIN.? ?? CHUCK BERRY (??SWEET LITTLE SIXTEEN?) SO MUCH OF OUR CULTURE TURNS A BLIND EYE OR GLEEFULLY ENDORSES THE HYPERSEXUALIZING OF TEEN GIRLS. AND WHEN THE STORIES ARE ANECDOTAL AS OPPOSED TO RIPPED FROM THE HEADLINES IT CAN BE EASY TO DISMISS AND MINIMIZE THE ACTS OF ARTISTS LIKE BOWIE AND PAGE AS SOMETHING ??OF THE TIME.? BUT STATUTORY RAPE LAWS EXISTED EVEN IN THE COKE-FUELED HEDONISM OF THE 1970S??BECAUSE SOMEONE HAD TO BE PROTECTIVE OF YOUNG GIRLS WHO WERE SUSCEPTIBLE TO PREDATORS WITH BIG HAIR AND LOUD GUITARS. BUT AS IT TURNS OUT NO ONE CARED ABOUT PROTECTING THESE GIRLS THEY WERE TOO BUSY MYTHOLOGIZING THE ROCKERS WHO WERE ABUSING THEM. EARLY ROCK ??N?? ROLLERS CHUCK BERRY AND JERRY LEE LEWIS BOTH SAW THEIR CAREERS SULLIED BY HEADLINES INVOLVING UNDERAGE GIRLS: LEWIS REVEALED THAT HE WAS MARRIED TO HIS 13-YEAR-OLD COUSIN IN 1958 AND WAS SUBSEQUENTLY BLACKLISTED FROM RADIO WHILE BERRY WAS ARRESTED AND FOUND GUILTY OF TRANSPORTING AN UNDERAGE GIRL ACROSS STATE LINES FOR IMMORAL PURPOSES SPENDING TWO YEARS IN JAIL IN 1960. EAGLES DRUMMER AND VOCALIST DON HENLEY WAS ARRESTED IN 1980 IN LOS ANGELES AND CHARGED WITH CONTRIBUTING TO THE DELINQUENCY OF A MINOR AFTER PARAMEDICS WERE CALLED TO HIS HOME TO SAVE A NAKED 16-YEAR-OLD GIRL WHO WAS OVERDOSING ON COCAINE AND QUAALUDES. HE WAS FINED $2000 GIVEN TWO YEARS' PROBATION AND ORDERED INTO A DRUG COUNSELING PROGRAM. ROCKER TURNED RIGHT-WING CARICATURE TED NUGENT SOUGHT OUT UNDERAGE GIRLS GOING SO FAR AS TO BECOME THE LEGAL GUARDIAN OF PELE MASSA WHEN SHE WAS 17 JUST TO BE ABLE TO DUCK KIDNAPPING CHARGES. PRINCE KEPT ANNA GARCIA AKA ??ANNA FANTASTIC? WITH HIM AT HIS PAISLEY PARK COMPOUND WHEN SHE WAS A TEENAGER. SHE WOULD ULTIMATELY BECOME THE SUBJECT OF SEVERAL OF HIS LATE ??80S/EARLY ??90S WORKS LIKE ??VICKI WAITING? AND ??PINK CASHMERE? WHICH HE WROTE FOR ANNA ON HER 18TH BIRTHDAY. ??I MET HIM WHEN I WAS 15 THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I MET HIM. AND WE JUST SPOKE AND HAD A NICE CONVERSATION AND NOTHING ELSE? SHE TOLD A DUTCH INTERVIEWER IN THE ??90S. ??AND THEN WHEN I WAS 17 I BUMPED INTO HIM AND THAT??S WHEN WE STARTED A RELATIONSHIP WHICH WAS ALMOST TWO YEARS. I GUESS IT??S KIND OF A DREAM TO A YOUNG GIRL OF 17. YOU CAN BE INFLUENCED VERY EASILY AND STUFF LIKE THAT BECAUSE HE??S 12-13 YEARS OLDER THAN ME.? PRINCE DATED MAYTE GARCIA SHORTLY THEREAFTER A DANCER HE MET WHEN SHE WAS 16. ??WHEN WE MET I WAS A VIRGIN AND HAD NEVER BEEN WITH ANYBODY? SHE TOLD THE MIRROR LAST YEAR. THE TWO WOULD MARRY IN 1996 WHEN MAYTE WAS 22. UNLIKE ANNA MAYTE INSISTS PRINCE DIDN??T PURSUE HER SERIOUSLY UNTIL SHE WAS 18. ??I??D ALWAYS BEEN A VERY FOCUSED DANCER AND VERY PROTECTED? SHE SAID. ??PRINCE WAS?ŸMY FIRST CRUSH AND MY FIRST LOVE BUT WE DIDN??T START TO GET SERIOUS UNTIL I TURNED 18. HE WAS VERY RESPECTFUL.? THERE HAVE BEEN VARYING STORIES SURROUNDING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A YOUNG ARETHA FRANKLIN AND THE LATE SAM COOKE. SHE HAS INDICATED IN INTERVIEWS THAT THINGS BETWEEN THEM BECAME ROMANTIC BUT IN HIS UNAUTHORIZED BIOGRAPHY DAVID RITZ INDICATED THAT THEIR FIRST ENCOUNTER OCCURRED WHEN SHE WAS ONLY 12 YEARS OLD AND VISITED COOKE IN HIS MOTEL ROOM IN ATLANTA. IN THE SAM COOKE LEGENDS TELEVISION DOCUMENTARY ARETHA RECALLED AN INCIDENT INVOLVING HER BEING IN COOKE??S ROOM BUT INDICATED THAT HER FATHER INTERRUPTED WHAT WAS LIKELY GOING TO BE A SEXUAL ENCOUNTER. ??WE DID RUN INTO SAM ON THE ROAD. AND ONE TIME IN PARTICULAR WE WERE ALL THERE IN THE HOTEL. AND HIS ROOM WAS ONLY TWO DOORS AWAY FROM MY ROOM. AND THE STAPLE SINGERS WERE RIGHT ACROSS THE HALL FROM HIM? SHE SAID IN THE LATE ??90S. ??SO I GOT DRESSED AND WENT DOWN AND KNOCKED ON HIS DOOR AND SAT THERE??HE WAS NOT MARRIED AT THIS TIME??I SAT THERE ON THE SIDE OF THE BED VERY INNOCUOUSLY. AND WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT THE MUSIC INDUSTRY AND OTHER ARTISTS AND WHATEVER ELSE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT AND THE DOOR WAS CLOSED. WHILE WE WERE TALKING THE CONVERSATION TOOK ANOTHER TURN. [SMIRKS] READ BETWEEN THE LINES. AND MY DAD WAS LOOKING FOR ME??AT THE SAME TIME JUST AS IT TOOK THIS ??OTHER TURN.?? AND WE HEAR [HIM] ??ARETHA I KNOW YOU??RE IN THERE!??? MARVIN GAYE MET JANIS HUNTER AROUND THE TIME OF HER 17TH BIRTHDAY AND THE STILL-MARRIED MOTOWN STAR PURSUED THE TEENAGER IMMEDIATELY. ACCORDING TO HUNTER??S 2015 MEMOIR AFTER THE DANCE GAYE TOOK HER TO AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT IN HOLLYWOOD AND BRIBED THE WAITER $20 TO BRING THE UNDERAGE GIRL APRICOT SOURS. HE HAD SEX WITH HER SHORTLY THEREAFTER AND THE TWO BEGAN A RELATIONSHIP DESPITE A 17-YEAR AGE DIFFERENCE AND THE FACT THAT MARVIN WAS STILL LEGALLY MARRIED TO HIS FIRST WIFE ANNA GORDY. GAYE WOULD FAMOUSLY WRITE ??LET??S GET IT ON? IN TRIBUTE TO HIS LUST FOR JAN. SHORTLY AFTER GIVING BIRTH TO A DAUGHTER NONA JAN AND MARVIN WERE FEATURED IN A NOVEMBER 1974 ISSUE OF EBONY WHEN SHE WAS 18. THEY WOULD MARRY IN 1977 AFTER MARVIN??S DIVORCE FROM ANNA WAS FINALIZED BUT JANIS WOULD LEAVE THE SINGER IN 1981. WE CAN DISMISS ALL OF THIS AS JUST THE ??WAY THINGS WERE BACK THEN.? WE CAN PRETEND THAT WE HAVEN??T HEARD COUNTLESS SONGS ABOUT YOUNG ??LOLITAS? WHO WERE ??JUST SEVENTEEN??YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.? WE CAN IGNORE THE RACIAL IMPLICATIONS IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA??S RELATIVE SILENCE ON ROCKERS?? HISTORIES OF STATUTORY RAPE AND ITS GLORIFICATION. BUT THE NEXT TIME YOU WATCH ALMOST FAMOUS TAKE NOTE OF HOW MUCH YOUNGER MOST OF THE BAND AIDS SEEM COMPARED TO THE WORLD-WEARY ROCKERS THAT ARE REPEATEDLY SHOWN TAKING THEM TO BED (KATE HUDSON??S PENNY LANE IS 16 IN THE FILM). NOTE HOW THE MOVIE CASUALLY NODS TO PAGE AND MATTIX IN A SCENE AT THE INFAMOUS HYATT ??RIOT HOUSE? ON SUNSET STRIP. AND THINK ABOUT HOW MANY GIRLS WOULD??VE BEEN BETTER OFF HAD SOMEONE GIVEN A DAMN WAY BACK WHEN AS OPPOSED TO JUST FAWNING OVER A GUITARIST WITH SOME HIT SONGS. FORMER ROLLING STONES BASSIST BILL WYMAN INFAMOUSLY BEGAN SEEING 13-YEAR-OLD MANDY SMITH IN 1983. ACCORDING TO SMITH WYMAN HAD SEX WITH HER WHEN SHE WAS 14. THEY MARRIED WHEN SHE TURNED 18 IN 1989 THEY DIVORCED IN 1991. SHE SPOKE ABOUT HER TIME WITH THE EX-STONE IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE DAILY MAIL IN 2010. ??IT??S NOT ABOUT BEING PHYSICALLY MATURE. IT??S EMOTIONAL MATURITY THAT MATTERS? SHE STATED AFTER MAKING IT CLEAR THAT SHE REGRETS WHAT HAPPENED TO HER. ??I DON??T THINK MOST 16-YEAR-OLDS ARE READY. I THINK THE AGE OF CONSENT SHOULD BE RAISED TO 18 AT A MINIMUM AND SOME GIRLS AREN??T EVEN READY THEN.? ??I KNOW I KNOW.

THEN IN DECEMBER TWITTER SEEMINGLY TRIED TO TRICK USERS INTO DISCOVERING THE MOMENTS FEATURE BY SWITCHING ITS PLACE ON THE TOP BAR WITH THE OFT-USED NOTIFICATIONS TAB. THERE WAS REVOLT AMONG THE FAITHFUL AND OF COURSE A CHROME EXTENSION TO REVERSE THE CHANGE. THE NEXT MONTH TWITTER ANNOUNCED THAT ONE OF THE DEFINING FEATURES OF THE PLATFORM??THE 140-CHARACTER LIMIT??COULD CHANGE TO ALLOW TWEETS AS LONG AS 10000 CHARACTERS. SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY POLLS STARTED SHOWING UP ON YOUR TIMELINE TOO AFTER BEING INTRODUCED LAST OCTOBER. BEHIND BOTH OF THESE MESSES IS A SINGLE PROBLEM: TRY AS IT MIGHT TWITTER CAN??T SEEM TO ATTRACT NEW USERS FAST ENOUGH. IN 2015 THE PLATFORM??S GROWTH SLOWED HITTING A WALL JUST ABOVE 300 MILLION MONTHLY ACTIVE USERS. IN THE SOCIAL MEDIA GAME WHERE YOUR VALUE IS DETERMINED NOT JUST BY HOW MANY USERS YOU HAVE BUT BY YOUR ABILITY TO GAIN MORE FOUR MILLION NEWCOMERS IN ONE QUARTER IS JUST NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO STAY AFLOAT. FOR JOURNALISTS AND MEDIA TYPES WHO SPEND TOO MUCH TIME SCROLLING THROUGH COLUMNS ON TWEETDECK ANYWAY??PRESENT COMPANY INCLUDED??IT??S A SITUATION RIPE FOR THINK PIECES ABOUT QUITTING TWITTER THE DEATH OF TWITTER OR THE HARASSMENT THAT SOME SUSPECT IS STYMYING THE GROWTH OF THE PLATFORM. BUT WHATEVER TROUBLES TWITTER HAS ON THE SURFACE THERE??S AN UNDERLYING STRUCTURAL ISSUE AT STAKE: THERE ISN??T ONE TWITTER THERE ARE TWO TWITTERS AND NEITHER OF THEM IS THE TWITTER THAT TWITTER WANTS TO BE OR NEEDS TO BE IN ORDER TO GROW. ON ONE HAND THERE IS ENTERTAINMENT TWITTER THE LAND WHERE COMEDIANS TRY OUT NEW MATERIAL WHERE TEENS REFER TO CELEBRITIES AS ??MOM? AND ??DAD? WHERE BEEFS BETWEEN CELEBRITIES AND POLITICIANS ARE CHEERED ON WITH CRIES OF ??SLAY QUEEN? WHERE WIZ KHALIFA KANYE WEST AND AMBER ROSE DUKE IT OUT WITH TWEET STORMS AND SEXUAL INSULTS WHERE EVERYONE??S WAITING TO SEE WHAT MARTIN SHKRELI WILL SAY NEXT TO GHOSTFACE KILLAH. THIS IS TWITTER AS SPECTACLE A GLADIATOR??S ARENA IN WHICH WE ARE PEASANTS WHO SCROLL PAST ADS TO KEEP WATCHING MILLIONAIRES FIGHT EACH OTHER. ON THE OTHER THERE IS MEDIA TWITTER AN ENDLESS NAVEL-GAZING CHURN OF HEADLINES SCOOPS AND TAKES OF VARYING TEMPERATURES. THIS IS THE TWITTER FOR THOSE WITH ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND FOR THOSE WHO FANCY THEMSELVES INFORMED. IT??S AN AWFUL PLACE AND ALL JOURNALISTS KNOW IT BUT IT CONTINUES BECAUSE WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO PARTICIPATE. AS THE DAILY BEAST??S LIZZIE CROCKER WROTE OF THE RECENT ??QUIT TWITTER? TREND: ??UNLESS WE WANT TO BECOME ICE FISHERMEN IN ALASKA LEAVING THE INTERNET FOREVER IS A PIPE DREAM.? AT ITS BEST MEDIA TWITTER IS A PLACE WHERE VITAL STORIES CAN REACH A MASS AUDIENCE BEFORE MOST TV NEWS ANCHORS CAN EVEN GET OUT OF HAIR AND MAKEUP. AT ITS WORST IT??S A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE TRY TO ARGUE IN EARNEST THAT SPOONING IS SEXIST. LIKE ANY BINARY SCHEME THIS ONE??S DRASTICALLY OVERSIMPLIFIED AND THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS MOST NOTABLY BLACK TWITTER WHICH HAS LONG USED THE SERVICE IN A DYNAMIC MULTI-FACETED WAY AS A SOCIAL TOOL POLITICAL PLATFORM AND INTELLECTUAL MEETING GROUND. IT??S ALSO A KINGMAKER FOR DIVERSE TV SHOWS LIKE HOW TO GET AWAY WITH MURDER AND EMPIRE. SUFFICE IT TO SAY IF EVERYONE ON TWITTER WERE AS ENGAGED AS BLACK TWITTER JACK DORSEY WOULD BE A HAPPY CEO. TO BREAK THROUGH ITS CEILING OF ROUGHLY 320 MILLION USERS AND TO SHOW ADVERTISERS THE KIND OF NUMBERS THAT WARRANTS CHECKS TWITTER WOULD HAVE TO BE A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE COME NOT JUST TO WATCH OR STAY INFORMED BUT TO BE. BUT TWITTER IS A PLATFORM BUILT ON ASYMMETRY AND INTERPERSONAL INTERACTIONS. YOU HAVE FOLLOWERS NOT FRIENDS. YOU DON??T SHARE YOU RETWEET. THAT??S PART OF WHY ITS CURRENT GROWING PAINS FEEL SO ALIEN. WHEN TWITTER ANNOUNCED IN A VIDEO LAST NOVEMBER THAT IT WAS REPLACING THE STAR ICON WITH HEARTS IT CAME ACROSS A LOT LIKE WELL THIS POPULAR GIF OF A SKATEBOARD-TOTING STEVE BUSCEMI SAYING ??HOW DO YOU DO FELLOW KIDS?? THE RELEASE VIDEO TRIED TO GUIDE US INTO USING HEARTS TO SEND EACH OTHER MESSAGES LIKE ??ADORBS? ??AWW? ??STAY STRONG? AND ??HUGS.? ??SHOW HOW YOU FEEL WITHOUT MISSING A BEAT? IT SUGGESTED. IT WAS HILARIOUS. THE AFFECTIVE RANGE OF TWITTER SEEMS TO BE LIMITED TO AMUSEMENT MOURNING AND ANGER BOTH RIGHTEOUS AND OTHERWISE. THE IDEA THAT ??ADORBS? AND ??AWW? ARE THINGS ONE REGULARLY FEELS ON TWITTER??OUTSIDE OF LOOKING AT THE OCCASIONAL PHOTO OF A PUPPY??WAS SO CLEARLY AN ASPIRATIONAL MOVE ON TWITTER??S PART AND NOT A REFLECTION OF HOW PEOPLE WERE USING THE SERVICE. WATCHING THAT TWITTER HEARTS VIDEO WAS LIKE WATCHING PINOCCHIO WISH HE WERE A REAL BOY. THERE ARE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS WHERE SUCH A PRODUCT WOULD FEEL MORE NATURAL. FACEBOOK CURRENTLY DOMINATES IN MONTHLY USERS??A FULL 71 PERCENT OF ONLINE ADULTS IN THE U.S. USE IT ACCORDING TO PEW??BECAUSE WE LIVE AND YES SOMETIMES EVEN FEEL ON IT. MOST OF US DON??T REALLY LIVE ON TWITTER WE COME TO IT FOR CELEBRITY GOSSIP JOKE CONSUMPTION SELF-PROMOTION OR BREAKING NEWS UPDATES AND WE LEAVE. WE PAY A VISIT TO ONE OR BOTH OF THE TWO TWITTERS AND THEN GO HOME??TO FACEBOOK. WHERE PEOPLE STILL UNIRONICALLY SAY THINGS TO EACH OTHER LIKE ??STAY STRONG? ??AWW? AND ??HUGS.? FACEBOOK IS NOW ROLLING OUT NEW EMOJI-ESQUE REACTIONS LIKE ??SAD? ??ANGRY? ??HAHA? AND ??LOVE? IN ADDITION TO THE ??LIKE? BUTTON AND WHILE THAT??S A BIG CHANGE IT DOESN??T SEEM AT ODDS WITH THE NATURE OF THE SERVICE. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA AISLE EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION COMES ABOUT AS NATURALLY TO TWITTER AS BREAKDANCING DOES TO ROBOCOP. AND BESIDES MOST OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPEN ON ENTERTAINMENT AND MEDIA TWITTER EVENTUALLY MAKE IT TO FACEBOOK ANYWAY. AS LONG AS YOU DON??T CRAVE THE ADRENALINE RUSH OF BREAKING NEWS YOU WILL GET A GENERAL SENSE OF WHAT??S GOING ON IN THE WORLD??AND WHAT YOUR FAVORITE CELEBRITIES ARE UP TO??IF YOU SCROLL THROUGH YOUR FEED LONG ENOUGH. TWITTER IS ALSO STRUGGLING TO STAY COMPETITIVE AMONG THE GENERATION THAT WOULD EVEN UTTER A WORD LIKE ??ADORBS.? INSTAGRAM AND SNAPCHAT BOTH HAVE A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF USERS AGES 18 TO 24??23 AND 45 PERCENT RESPECTIVELY??THAN TWITTER??S 19 PERCENT ACCORDING TO COMSCORE DATA. THIS IS IN PART BECAUSE INSTAGRAM AND SNAPCHAT SEAMLESSLY COMBINE THE APPEAL OF ENTERTAINMENT TWITTER??HAVING A DIRECT WINDOW INTO THE LIVES OF THE RICH AND FAMOUS??WITH THE KIND OF INTENSELY PERSONAL EXPRESSION THAT SEEMS SO ILL-FITTED FOR TWITTER. MEDIA TWITTER TOO HAS NOTICED THE SUCCESS OF THESE VISUAL PLATFORMS AND NOW SNAPCHAT??S DISCOVER FEATURE HAS BECOME THE HOT NEW PLACE TO SCROUNGE FOR VIEWS AND MOBILE USERS. MOST IMPORTANTLY THESE OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA SERVICES AREN??T HOPELESSLY FRAGMENTED IN THE WAY THAT TWITTER IS. THERE??S ONE FACEBOOK EXPERIENCE FOR EVERYONE AND SURE IT MAY LOOK LIKE A JUMBLED MESS OF MULTI-GENERATIONAL POLITICAL ARGUMENTS FAMILY PHOTOS NEWS ARTICLES AND VIRAL VIDEOS BUT THAT??S WHAT FACEBOOK IS AND IT??S COME TO FEEL STRANGELY COHESIVE. ON INSTAGRAM THERE??S A CERTAIN UNIFYING LOGIC BETWEEN SEEING WHAT KHLOE KARDASHIAN IS WEARING TO BRUNCH AND POSTING A FILTERED PHOTO OF YOUR FRITTATA. NOT SO WITH TWITTER WHERE CELEBRITIES UNLEASH CANDID PHOTOS ON THEIR FANS JOURNALISTS SCREAM TAKES LIKE THIS ONE INTO THE VOID AND EVERYONE ELSE IS NOT QUITE SURE WHY THEY USE IT EXCEPT THAT THEIR ONE JOURNALIST FRIEND TOLD THEM TO MAKE AN ACCOUNT. THE BIG PROBLEM FACING THE STRUGGLING SOCIAL MEDIA GIANT IS THAT NEITHER OF THE TWO TWITTERS HAVE THINGS TO OFFER THAT MOST USERS CAN??T GET ELSEWHERE. AND PERHAPS THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO NEED THOSE THINGS WITH THE LEVEL OF IMMEDIACY THAT TWITTER OFFERS IS FINITE: 320 MILLION AND VERY FEW MORE. ENTERTAINMENT TWITTER IS WHERE WE GO FOR DRAMA. MEDIA TWITTER IS WHERE WE GO FOR NEWS. TO GROW AND THEREFORE SURVIVE TWITTER WOULD NEED TO KEEP THESE TWO OFFERINGS ON TAP WHILE ALSO GLUING THEM TOGETHER WITH SOMETHING THAT HAS ALWAYS ELUDED IT: THE HUMAN TOUCH. IT WOULD HAVE TO FEEL MORE LIKE ONE TWITTER NOT TWO. ,4217.0

1287,10361144.0,2016-01-28T05:13:00+00:00,SEXUAL ASSAULT: THE ACCUSED SPEAK OUT,MATTHEW* ADORED HIS SMALL LIBERAL ARTS COLLEGE??UNTIL HE WAS CHARGED WITH AND ULTIMATELY ISSUED A SEMESTER-LONG SUSPENSION FOR NON-CONSENSUAL SEXUAL INTERCOURSE WITH ANOTHER MALE STUDENT. ??ONE OF THE KEY PHRASES WAS ??WE FOUND YOU GUILTY. PLAN ON NOT BOOKING A FLIGHT BACK.?? THAT STILL PUNCHES ME IN THE STOMACH? MATTHEW TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. ??THE FOLLOWING DAY I HAD AN 8 AM FLIGHT I WAS UP ??TILL 3 AM. I HAD TO PACK UP ALL OF MY ROOM.? HIS LOVE AND TRUST IN HIS COLLEGE COMPLETELY CHANGED WHEN HE WAS NOTIFIED THAT SCHOOL WAS ??INVESTIGATING TWO ALLEGED INCIDENTS OF NONCONSENSUAL SEXUAL INTERCOURSE? ACCORDING TO THE LETTER MATTHEW RECEIVED FROM THE OFFICE OF TITLE IX COORDINATION WHICH HE SHARED WITH THE DAILY BEAST. (TITLE IX IS A STATUTE THAT PROHIBITS SEX-BASED DISCRIMINATION IN SCHOOLS THAT RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDING AND IT IS OFTEN APPLIED TO ENFORCE SEXUAL ASSAULT REFORM.) MATTHEW ADAMANTLY DENIED BOTH CHARGES STATING THEIR FIRST ENCOUNTER WAS CONSENSUAL AND THE SECOND WAS NOT ACTUALLY SEXUAL. HE SAID AT THAT SECOND ENCOUNTER THE ACCUSER ??LED ME INTO A ROOM AND STARTED KISSING ME. I SAID ??I??M NOT COMFORTABLE?? AND HE SAID HE NEEDED TO GO.? MATTHEW THOUGHT NOTHING OF THEIR MOST RECENT ENCOUNTER UNTIL HE WAS NOTIFIED A FEW DAYS LATER THAT HE HAD BEEN ACCUSED OF TWO COUNTS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS WERE A DEVASTATING TIME OF BEING ??BRANDED A RAPIST? HE SAID ON HIS SMALL CAMPUS AND BREAKING INTO PANIC ATTACKS EVERY TIME HE CROSSED PATHS WITH HIS ACCUSER. ??DURING THIS PROCESS I LEARNED WHAT IT MEANT TO BE SCARED? HE SAID. IN ADDITION TO GRAPPLING WITH WHAT IN HIS MIND WAS A FALSE ACCUSATION MATTHEW LIVED IN FEAR OF FURTHER RETALIATORY CHARGES. HE BECAME FRIGHTENED TO BE ALONE ON CAMPUS TERRIFIED OF CROSSING PATHS WITH HIS ACCUSER. ??I HAD CLASS AND TRIED TO DO HOMEWORK AND PRETEND IT WAS ALL OKAY BUT I WAS CONSIDERED A THREAT. THIS IS A SMALL RESIDENTIAL COLLEGE SO HOW DO YOU NAVIGATE THE SPACE WHERE YOU DON??T WANT TO SEE THIS PERSON AND YOU CAN BE ACCUSED OF RETALIATING? ??WHAT DO YOU DO IF YOU GO TO CLASS AND YOU SEE THIS STUDENT? YOU HAVE TO TURN AWAY BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU BRUSH AGAINST THEM YOU CAN BE ACCUSED OF RETALIATING.? MATTHEW WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH THE INVESTIGATORY PROCESS AT HIS SCHOOL AND FELT HE HAD BEEN ??UNFAIRLY TREATED.? DURING OUR INTERVIEW HE CITED WHAT HE SAW AS MANY FAILINGS IN THE PROCESS INCLUDING THE FACT THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE WITNESSES HE SUBMITTED TO THE TITLE IX OFFICE WERE NEVER CALLED. ??I DO WANT TO RECOGNIZE SEXUAL ASSAULT IS REAL AND HORRIBLE. I??M HAPPY TO KNOW THERE ARE PROCEDURES AND THINGS PUT IN PLACE TO BRING JUSTICE TO THOSE WHO ARE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED. THEIR STORIES SHOULD BE TOLD. ??BUT IN CASES LIKE MINE THOSE WHO ABUSE THE SYSTEM AND USE IT TO HURT OTHER STUDENTS WHATEVER ULTERIOR MOTIVE WITH SEXUAL ASSAULT??IT IS A HORRIBLE THING TO HAPPEN.? MAGNIFYING THE PAIN AND STRESS OF HIS SITUATION ARE THE FACT THAT THIS SUSPENSION FORCED HIM TO COME OUT TO HIS PARENTS. ??CAN YOU IMAGINE COMING OUT TO YOUR FAMILY UNDER THE PRETENSES YOU??RE ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND YOU??RE FOUND GUILTY? DURING THE INVESTIGATION I KNEW MY FAMILY WOULD BE THERE TO SUPPORT ME BUT I COULD NOT IMAGINE COMING OUT TO THEM TWICE: FIRST AS AN ALLEGED RAPIST AND SECOND AS SOMEONE WHO IS GAY.? ??I??M STRUGGLING WITH DEPRESSION? HE SAID. ??I??M STRUGGLING WITH INSOMNIA. I??M STRUGGLING TO FIGURE OUT THE REST OF MY LIFE. I??M TRYING TO PICK UP THE PIECES.?* IN JANUARY 2014 PRESIDENT OBAMA LAUNCHED A SPECIAL TASK FORCE TO INVESTIGATE RAPE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT ON CAMPUSES. ON MAY 1 2014 THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION REVEALED 55 SCHOOLS WERE UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR TITLE IX VIOLATIONS RELATED TO THEIR MISHANDLING OF SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES. THAT LIST HAS SINCE GROWN TO WELL OVER 100. DURING THE PAST TWO YEARS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS STRESSED HOW SEVERE A PROBLEM SEXUAL ASSAULT IS ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES OFTEN CITING THAT ONE IN FIVE FEMALE STUDENTS ARE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED WITH THE BUREAU OF JUSTICE STATISTICS RELEASING ANOTHER STUDY SUPPORTING THAT ESTIMATE THIS PAST MONTH. THIS MOST RECENT STUDY DEFINED SEXUAL ASSAULT AS ??FORCED KISSING TOUCHING GRABBING OR FONDLING? ACCORDING TO INSIDE HIGHER ED. THAT BROAD DEFINITION HAS RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT THE ACCURACY OF THE ONE-IN-FIVE AND THE EVEN MORE ALARMING ONE-IN-FOUR STATISTIC PUBLISHED IN 2015 AND WHETHER THESE STATISTICS MISLEADING PERPETUATE A SENSE OF PANIC ON CAMPUSES. ATTORNEY ANDREW MILTENBERG ESTIMATED THAT TWO AROUND TWO YEARS AGO HE HAD ONLY HAD FIVE OR SIX CASES INVOLVING MALE STUDENTS SUING THEIR SCHOOLS FOR BEING WRONGFULLY EXPELLED OR SUSPENDED FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT OR VIOLENCE. ??THERE WAS NOT A DAILY FLOW OF CALLS ON THIS TOPIC AND NOW THERE ARE. IN THE LAST 18 TO 24 MONTHS THE COMPLAINTS AND HOW TO REPRESENT AND PROCESS THESE DISCIPLINARY MATTERS HAVE BECOME AN ISSUE? MILTENBERG TOLD THE DAILY BEAST SAYING HE HAS BEEN APPROACHED BY YOUNG MEN FROM OVER 100 DIFFERENT UNIVERSITIES OVER THAT TIME SEEKING HIS LEGAL COUNSEL. WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT??S EFFORTS IN THE PAST TWO YEARS BRINGING MORE ATTENTION TO CAMPUS SEXUAL ASSAULT THE MEDIA HAS MORE OFTEN REPORTED THE PERSPECTIVE AND EXPERIENCES OF VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT UNDERSTANDABLY SO BECAUSE THEY HAD BEEN IGNORED STIGMATIZED AND IN SOME CASES ACTIVELY SILENCED FOR SO LONG. LESS FREQUENTLY REPORTED ARE THE TURMOIL AND HARDSHIPS FOR THE STUDENTS ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AS WELL AS THE EMOTIONAL (AND FINANCIAL) ANGUISH SUFFERED BY THEIR FAMILIES DURING AN INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS THAT MANY??INCLUDING THE HARVARD LAW FACULTY ARGUE VIOLATE THEIR DUE PROCESS RIGHTS. MILTENBERG BELIEVED THE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS ITSELF CONTRIBUTES TO THE EMOTIONAL TURMOIL FOR THE STUDENTS ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. ??IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE THE PROCESS IS PART OF THE PUNISHMENT? SAID MILTENBERG. ??THEY [HIS CLIENTS] ARE SUICIDAL. THEY ARE DEPRESSED. THEY ARE ANXIOUS. THERE IS AN OVERWHELMING SENSE OF DESPAIR BECAUSE THE WEIGHT OF THE INSTITUTION AND THE WEIGHT OF THE PROCESS ARE BEARING DOWN ON THEM. THEY ARE DROPPING OUT. THEY ARE IN THERAPY.? ??THE COUNTERPOINT IS THINK OF THE TRAUMA TO THE VICTIM AND OF COURSE I DO. I HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS AND A SON? MILTENBERG SAID. TO HIM THE SEXUAL ASSAULT DISCIPLINARY PROCESS ON CAMPUSES IS A DISSERVICE TO BOTH THE VICTIM AND THE ACCUSED. ??THERE??S SOMETHING ABOUT THE WAY THE PROCESS IS EVOLVING THAT DOESN??T WORK FOR THE ACCUSER AND THE ACCUSED.? FOR THIS ARTICLE I INTERVIEWED PEOPLE I FOUND THROUGH FAMILIES ADVOCATING FOR CAMPUS EQUALITY A GROUP ESTABLISHED TO PROVIDE LEGAL GUIDANCE FOR STUDENTS WHO BELIEVE THEY WERE FALSELY ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. THE STUDENTS AND THEIR PARENTS ALL DESCRIBED THEIR ENCOUNTERS AS COMPLETELY CONSENSUAL EVEN IN ONE CASES NOT IN FACT SEXUAL IN NATURE. IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT THIS COHORT HAS ITS OWN BIASES AND IN SOME CASES ANGER. NEVERTHELESS THESE STUDENTS?? AND THEIR FAMILIES?? STORIES PAINT A RARELY TOLD ACCOUNT OF THE EMOTIONAL AND FINANCIAL HARDSHIPS OF GOING THROUGH THE CAMPUS SEXUAL ASSAULT DISCIPLINARY PROCESS AS SOMEONE ACCUSED OF ONE OF THE MOST HEINOUS CRIMES POSSIBLE. ??IT??S A HEAVY BURDEN TO BEAR. THE STENCH NEVER LEAVES. THE STIGMA ATTACHES NO MATTER HOW IT RESOLVES? SAID MILTENBERG.* WHILE MATTHEW IS GRAPPLING WITH WHETHER TO RETURN TO A SCHOOL THAT HE BELIEVES PUNISHED HIM FOR A FALSE ACCUSATION HIS OPTION IS ENVIABLE TO SOMEONE LIKE ALEX A 23-YEAR-OLD WHO ASKED TO HAVE HIS LAST NAME WITHHELD. ALEX WAS EXPELLED FROM HIS COLLEGE IN FALL OF 2014 FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT SIX WEEKS BEFORE HE WAS SET TO GRADUATE. ALEX SAID OFFICIALS FROM HIS SCHOOL HAVE REFUSED TO ANSWER HIS OR HIS FATHER??S REQUEST FOR HOW THE DISCIPLINARY PANEL DECIDED TO EXPEL HIM OR REJECT HIS APPEAL. INSTEAD ON THE DAY THE DECISION WAS REACHED HE SAID AN ADMINISTRATOR SIMPLY TOLD HIM ??YOU HAVE TO PACK UP ALL YOUR STUFF AND BE MOVED OFF CAMPUS BY 4 O??CLOCK TODAY.? ALEX WHO HAD BEEN ON THE SCHOOL??S FOOTBALL TEAM DESCRIBED BEING IN A STATE OF SHOCK WHILE TRYING TO QUICKLY PACK UP HIS BELONGINGS AND EMPTY OUT HIS LOCKER ROOM BEFORE HIS TEAMMATES ARRIVED TO AVOID THE EMBARRASSMENT OF EXPLAINING HE HAD BEEN EXPELLED??OR WHY HE HAD BEEN EXPELLED. ??WE WERE ALL GETTING READY TO GO ON A BUS TO GO ON AN AWAY GAME. I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO ON A BUS WITH THEM AND I WAS GETTING KICKED OUT. I TRIED TO GET TO THE LOCKER ROOM TO CLEAN OUT MY LOCKER BUT A FEW WERE THERE EARLY. THAT WAS REALLY EMBARRASSING. I SAID GOODBYE TO THEM. I WISHED THEM LUCK.? HIS PARENTS DROVE CLOSE TO THREE HOURS TO PICK HIM UP AND BRING HIM HOME. AFTER FILING HIS APPEAL AND HAVING IT ??RUBBER STAMPED? WITH A REJECTION AS ALEX CALLED IT BY THE TITLE IX COORDINATOR HIS SHOCK TURNED INTO DEPRESSION. ??I WAS JUST IN A RUT. I MOPED AROUND MY HOUSE. I DIDN??T WORK. I GAINED WEIGHT. I DIDN??T WANT TO GO BACK TO THE GYM AND SHOW MY FACE BECAUSE EVERYONE THOUGHT I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AT SCHOOL. I DIDN??T WANT TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT WHY I WAS THERE [AND NOT AT SCHOOL]. I THOUGHT ABOUT THE SITUATION AND CRIED MYSELF TO SLEEP. I WAS BORDERLINE SUICIDAL.? ALEX SAID HE DECIDED TO START GOING TO THERAPY THIS PAST APRIL AROUND SIX MONTHS AFTER HE WAS EXPELLED BECAUSE ??I JUST KNEW I WASN??T MENTALLY HEALTHY? HE SAID. ??THE THOUGHTS I WAS HAVING ABOUT DRIVING MY CAR OFF THE ROAD INTO A TREE WERE SCARING ME. I DIDN??T WANT TO HURT ANYONE WHO LOVED ME. I KNEW I NEEDED HELP.? WHILE ALEX SAID HE TAKES ANTIDEPRESSANTS EVERYDAY NOW (40MG OF CELEXA) AND REGULARLY SEES A THERAPIST HE HAS BY NO MEANS RECOVERED FINANCIALLY OR EMOTIONALLY. ??IT??S RUINED MY LIFE. IT??S TOO LATE TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL AND PICK A DIFFERENT CAREER. I??M EMBARRASSED. IT??S PUT A HOLD ON MY LIFE. I STILL HAVE NO DEGREE NOTHING TO SHOW FOR IT. I FEEL LIKE EVERYTHING HAS JUST STOPPED AND I CAN??T GO ANYWHERE? HE SAID. CHARLOTTE* WHOSE SON WAS EXPELLED FROM A SMALL LIBERAL ARTS COLLEGE IN THE MIDWEST SAID HER SON STRUGGLED WITH SUICIDAL THOUGHTS FROM THE MOMENT THE CAMPUS DISCIPLINARY PROCESS BEGAN. SHE REMEMBERED GETTING THE CALL THAT HE HAD BEEN ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT??AND HAD BEEN RUSHED TO A PSYCH WARD. ??I WAS AT THE GROCERY STORE WITH MY HUSBAND. I GET A CALL FROM MY SON AND HE SAYS ??MOM THEY??RE TAKING ME TO THE HOSPITAL. CARLY [EDITOR??S NOTE: NOT THE REAL NAME OF THE FEMALE STUDENT] IS ACCUSING ME OF RAPE AND I FREAKED OUT AND I SAID WHAT??S THE POINT OF LIVING? THEY??RE TAKING ME TO THE PSYCH WARD AND I??M SCARED??? SHE TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. ??HE SAID HE HAD A PLAN FOR HOW HE WAS GOING TO CARRY OUT SUICIDE? CHARLOTTE SAID. HER SON WAS INITIALLY SUSPENDED A YEAR BUT WHEN HIS ACCUSER WROTE A LETTER APPEALING AND BEGGING FOR A HARSHER PUNISHMENT HE WAS EXPELLED CHARLOTTE SAID. ??I STILL HAVE FEARS THAT THE SUICIDE THING MIGHT COME BACK? CHARLOTTE SAID. ??HE??S ASSURED ME THAT HE??S FINE BUT HE??S NOT MOVING ON. HE??LL DO CHORES AROUND THE HOUSE IF I ASK HIM. IT HAS TO BE VERY SPECIFIC DIRECT REQUESTS. HE DOESN??T HAVE A LOT OF INTERNAL MOTIVATION. I FEEL THIS WHOLE THING HAS KILLED THE SON I HAD. THIS IS NOT MY SON. HE WAS SO DRIVEN SO MOTIVATED. HE HAD THIS WHOLE PLAN AND NOW IT??S LIKE HE??S DEAD.? PARENTS INTERVIEWED FOR THIS ARTICLE ECHOED THIS DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAMATIC MENTAL HEALTH TOLL OF THEIR SONS?? EXPERIENCES OF BEING FALSELY ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES??EVEN WHEN THEY WERE ULTIMATELY FOUND NOT GUILTY OF THE CHARGES. ABBY* SAID HER SON WAS CHARGED WITH SEXUAL ASSAULT AS A FRESHMAN AT SOUTHERN METHODIST UNIVERSITY (SMU) EVEN AFTER A GRAND JURY DECLINED TO INDICT HIM FOR THE ALLEGED INCIDENT. HER SON WAS FOUND NOT GUILTY BY THE SCHOOL BY HIS SOPHOMORE YEAR ACCORDING TO ABBY. HOWEVER EVEN THOUGH A COLLEGE INVESTIGATION AT SMU EXONERATED HER SON ABBY SAID HE HAS BEEN IRREPARABLY EMOTIONALLY CHANGED BY THE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS. SHE SAID IT WAS FAR WORSE THAT THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION AND GRAND JURY PROCESS. ??AS TERRIFYING AS GOING THROUGH THE LEGAL PROCESS??THE POTENTIAL WAS 22 YEARS IN THE FEDERAL PEN WHICH IS A TERRIFYING THOUGHT??KNOWING HE DIDN??T DO SOMETHING WRONG WE THOUGHT THE TRUTH WOULD PREVAIL? ABBY? TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. ??AND IT DID. HE GOT THROUGH THAT PRETTY WELL. HE HAD HIS RIGHTS AND HIS RIGHTS WERE UPHELD.? BUT THE MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS HE NOW SUFFERS ARE A RESULT OF THE PROTRACTED SCHOOL DISCIPLINARY PROCESS AND ??MIND GAMES ON THE PART OF ADMINISTRATORS? SHE SAID. SMU IS NOT ONE OF THE UNIVERSITIES CURRENTLY UNDER FEDERAL INVESTIGATION FOR VIOLATING TITLE IX IN ITS HANDLING OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. ??WHEN WE STARTED DOWN THE PATH FOR THE SCHOOL DISCIPLINARY PROCESS IT BLEW OUT OF CONTROL. YOU??RE HEARING NO HARM NO FOUL. BUT IT??S NOT FINE. HE??S NOT THE SAME PERSON HE WAS. HE WILL NOT BE THE SAME PERSON HE WAS? ABBY SAID. SHE RECALLED HOW THE FORMERLY OPTIMISTIC CHEERFUL BOY HER SON WAS VANISHED AFTER THE SCHOOL INVESTIGATION. ??HE WAS PROBABLY IN MIDDLE SCHOOL AND I SAID ??THE GLASS IS ALWAYS HALF FULL FOR YOU?? AND HE SAID ??OH NO FOR ME THE GLASS IS ALWAYS FILLED TO THE BRIM.?? THAT??S HOW HE LOOKED AT LIFE? ABBY SAID. IT??S A STARK CONTRAST TO THE LIFE SHE SAID HER SON CURRENTLY LEADS FEARFUL OF LEAVING HIS APARTMENT AND SUFFERING FROM PTSD DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY. ABBY SAID MULTIPLE PSYCHIATRISTS DIAGNOSED THESE MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS AS DIRECT RESULTS OF THE TRAUMA CAUSED BY HIS FORMER UNIVERSITY??S DISCIPLINARY PROCESS. HE HAS BEEN UNABLE TO COMPLETE A SEMESTER AT HIS NEW COLLEGE. WHEN ASKED TO COMMENT ON THE ALLEGATION THAT THE SCHOOL??S SEXUAL ASSAULT INVESTIGATORY PROCESS DIRECTLY RESULTED IN AN ACCUSED STUDENT??S DEVELOPMENT OF DEPRESSION ANXIETY AND PTSD SMU??S OFFICE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS TOLD THE DAILY BEAST IN AN EMAILED STATEMENT: ??SMU TAKES EACH REPORT OF SEXUAL ASSAULT SERIOUSLY AND FOLLOWS ITS PROCEDURES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FEDERAL LAW TITLE IX OF THE EDUCATION AMENDMENTS OF 1972 STATE LAW AND UNIVERSITY POLICY. THE UNIVERSITY RECOGNIZES THAT THESE CASES ARE COMPLEX AND CAN HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES FOR ALL INVOLVED.? WHEN ABBY AND I SPOKE SHE SAID HER SON HAD OFFICIALLY WITHDRAWN FROM HIS NEW SCHOOL FOR A SECOND TIME FIVE DAYS INTO THE SEMESTER. ??HE CAN??T GO OUT TO A RESTAURANT. IT??S TOO STRESSFUL. THOSE [PTSD] VICTIMS SEEK A SAFE PLACE. WHEN THEY CARVE OUT THAT SAFE PLACE THEY DON??T LEAVE IT. HE DOESN??T GO OUT TO THE GROCERY STORE. HE ORDERS IN? SHE SAID. ??HE CALLED ME THE OTHER DAY SOBBING ??I??M SO TIRED OF THIS. I JUST WANT THIS TO GO AWAY.?? THAT??S THE NORM NOW? SHE SAID. THE FACT THAT HER SON WAS EXONERATED IS OF COLD COMFORT. ??YOU SEE YOUR KID DESTROYED THROUGH NO FAULT OF HIS OWN. THE DESTRUCTION THIS HAS CAUSED IS JUST UNBELIEVABLE. IN PART TOO IT??S FRUSTRATING BECAUSE EVERYONE SAYS ??OH GREAT. EVERYTHING WORKED OUT.?? WELL ACTUALLY NO. HE MAY AS WELL HAVE BEEN EXPELLED BECAUSE HE HASN??T BEEN ABLE TO FINISH A COLLEGE SEMESTER SINCE.? MILTENBERG MADE THE SAME POINT STRESSING THAT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE JUDICIAL OUTCOME FOR HIS CLIENTS WERE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE THEY DID NOT FULLY RECOVER FROM THE PROCESS. ??I??VE TALKED TO OVER 100 YOUNG MEN. NOT ONE OF THEM IS OKAY AFTER THIS EXPERIENCE? MILTENBERG SAID. ??WHETHER WE HAVE SETTLED OR GOTTEN THE STUDENT REINSTATED NOT ONE OF THEM IS OKAY AND THE RESULT [OF HIS LEGAL EFFORTS] IS NOT HAVING THAT MUCH OF AN IMPACT ON HOW TRAUMATIZED THEY ARE FROM THE PROCESS.?* ALEX SAID HE FEELS ESPECIALLY BAD ABOUT THE FINANCIAL STRESS HIS SEXUAL ASSAULT EXPULSION HAS PLACED ON HIS FAMILY. EVEN WITH THE HELP OF HIS PARENTS HE IS CURRENTLY STRUGGLING TO PAY STUDENT LOANS ON A DEGREE THAT NEVER MATERIALIZED AND LEGAL BILLS FOR HIRING AN OUTSIDE ATTORNEY TO ADVISE HIM ON BATTLING A CRIME HE SAID HE DIDN??T COMMIT. ??I STILL LIVE WITH MY FAMILY. I??LL ONLY MOVE OUT IN MY WILDEST DREAMS?? I??M JUST WASTING MY TIME WASTING MY LIFE AND STAYING AT MY PARENTS?? HOUSE. I CAN??T GROW UP AND BE AN ADULT AND START MY LIFE. THAT??S THE MOST DEPRESSING AND FRUSTRATING THING.? EVERY PERSON INTERVIEWED SAID THEIR FAMILY HAD SPENT AT LEAST TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR LEGAL AND/OR MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING IN RESPONSE TO THE SEXUAL ASSAULT ALLEGATION. ONE MOTHER SAID SHE AND HER HUSBAND HAD ALREADY INCURRED SIX-FIGURES-WORTH OF DEBT. ALEX SAID HIS FAMILY HAS ALREADY ACCRUED AT LEAST $30000 IN DEBT BUT HE??S DETERMINED TO HAVE JUSTICE??SO MUCH SO THAT HE WORKED THREE JOBS THIS PAST SUMMER. ??I DID CONSTRUCTION MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY. I COACHED CROSSFIT WITH PRIVATE CLIENTS AT THE GYM. I DID SECURITY AT CASINOS OVER THE WEEKEND. ALL THE MONEY HAS GONE TO STUDENT LOANS AND THE LAWYERS.

BUT DAVID BOWIE DID JUST THAT IN THE EARLY 1970S AND THE CHALLENGE THAT HE SET IN TERMS OF CONFRONTING DEFINITIONS OF SEXUALITY AND IMAGES OF MASCULINITY PROVE AS FRESH TODAY AS THEY DID THEN. COMING OUT AS I DID IN BRITAIN OF THE LATE 1980S GAY MEN IN THEIR 30S AND 40S WOULD TALK ABOUT WHAT A REVOLUTIONARY MARKER A PERSONAL LIGHTNING STRIKE BOWIE HAD BEEN FOR THEM AS BOYS AND TEENAGERS IN THE 1970S. LOU REED WALKING ON THE WILD SIDE HAD ALSO HAD HIS EFFECT BUT BOWIE AS ZIGGY STARDUST HAD QUITE LITERALLY BEAMED IN FROM ANOTHER PLANET. ACCORDING TO AUTHOR AND CULTURAL CRITIC MARK SIMPSON BOWIE??S APPEARANCE ON UK PRIMETIME INSTITUTION TOP OF THE POPS IN 1972 SINGING ??STARMAN?? ??AND HIS CALCULATED DRAPING OF HIS FEY ARM AROUND HIS GORGEOUS GUITARIST MICK RONSON WAS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT ??GAY PARADE?? THAT EVER HAPPENED IN THE UK.? SIMPSON TOLD THE DAILY BEAST ON MONDAY THAT ??THE FIRST ACTUAL ONE HAD ONLY OCCURRED IN LONDON A FEW DAYS EARLIER (ON JULY 1 1972) AND WAS BARELY NOTICED. BUT BOWIE??S HAD PARADED THROUGH THE LIVING ROOMS OF THE NATION. EVERYONE WATCHED THAT SHOW??AND A GENERATION OF KIDS LOVED THE APOPLECTIC REACTION BOWIE PROVOKED FROM THEIR 1970S DADS.? BOWIE HAD PLENTY TO SAY ABOUT HIS SEXUALITY??PLENTY MYSTERIOUS ENOUGH TO KEEP US ALL GUESSING AND WONDERING TO NOW THE END. HE WAS POST-GAY AND POLYSEXUAL BEFORE MOST CELEBRITIES WERE BRAVE ENOUGH TO DECLARE THEMSELVES ANYTHING BUT ABSOLUTELY STRAIGHT. IN MELODY MAKER IN 1972 BOWIE SAID HE WAS GAY. IN 1976 HE TOLD PLAYBOY HE WAS BISEXUAL SAYING HE HAD USED ??THAT FACT VERY WELL. I SUPPOSE IT??S THE BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME.? BOWIE LATER TOLD ROLLING STONE THAT ??I DIDN??T EVER FEEL I WAS A REAL BISEXUAL.? ZIGGY STARDUST WAS AN IMAGE CONFERRED UPON HIM HE SAID A LIE??AND NOT SOME RADICAL OUTER MANIFESTATION OF SOMETHING PERSONAL. COMING OUT AS BISEXUAL WAS THE ??BIGGEST MISTAKE I EVER MADE.? THE IRONY OF ZIGGY STARDUST BOWIE SAID ??WAS THAT I WAS NOT GAY. I WAS PHYSICAL ABOUT IT BUT FRANKLY IT WASN??T ENJOYABLE.? IN A BOOK ABOUT BOWIE??S SEX LIFE PUBLISHED IN 2014 TONY ZANETTA BOWIE??S EX-ASSISTANT SAID: ??WHEN WE WERE IN BED TOGETHER HE WAS MORE SENSUAL AND NARCISSISTIC.

WAS BOWIE GAY BISEXUAL TRISEXUAL? ??I WAS JUST VERY YOU KNOW?? I JUST GOT MY LEG OVER A LOT? BOWIE SAID CLEARLY WANTING TO BE DISCUSSING ANYTHING ELSE. ROSS PERSISTED. HAD BOWIE HAD RELATIONSHIPS WITH MEN? ??NOT IF I COULD HELP IT. I WAS INCREDIBLY PROMISCUOUS AND I THINK WE??LL LEAVE IT AT THAT.? WHY SHOULD HE TELL ROSS ANYTHING ELSE BOWIE JOKED WHEN HE COULD MAKE A FORTUNE WRITING IT UP AS A BOOK HIMSELF.

SHOULD HE GIVE GAY SEX A TRY ROSS ASKED BOWIE. ??SUCH A SERIOUS AND A LIFE-CHALLENGING AND CHANGING QUESTION? BOWIE SAID SLOWLY AND GRANDLY. ??THE ANSWER THAT I HAVE FOR YOU WOULD PROBABLY CREATE SUCH TURMOIL IN YOUR SOUL.

IN OUR MODERN ERA OF CLASSIFICATION AND CATEGORIES BOWIE ALWAYS REFUSED AN EASY LABEL. THERE WASN??T ONE THAT SUITED HIM. IN HIS REFUSAL TO LABEL HIMSELF THERE DIDN??T APPEAR TO BE A COWARDICE BUT RATHER AN HONESTY AND MATURITY AROUND HOW UNFIXED AT LEAST FOR HIM THE NOTION OF SEXUALITY WAS.

HE RETURNED WITH NO PHYSICAL WOUNDS. ??HE??S ALL RIGHT I THINK? SHE REPORTED. SHE WORRIES THAT THE WAR MIGHT HAVE HAD UNSEEN EFFECTS. ??I??M LOOKING AT HIM HARD? SHE SAID. HER OTHER WORRY IS THE BUSINESS. THE HYPER-LUXURY ENTERPRISES SUCH AS TIFFANY??S MIGHT BE BOOMING BUT SIDEWALK STANDS THAT CATER TO THE LESS WEALTHY 99 PERCENT ARE WAY DOWN. ??THIS IS THE WORST YEAR EVER? SHE LAMENTED. ??THE MONEY??S NOT THERE. PEOPLE AREN??T BUYING LIKE THEY USED TO.? SHE IS AWARE OF TRUMP??S EFFORTS TO CHASE THE PEDDLERS FROM THE STREET. SHE COUNTS THE CONTINUED PRESENCE OF HER AND HER COMRADES AS A DEFEAT FOR THE DONALD. ??HE LOST BECAUSE OF A LOT VETERANS IN THE STREET? SHE SAID. SHE THEN PONDERED THE POSSIBILITY OF VICTORIES FOR THE DONALD NOT JUST IN THE PRIMARIES BUT IN THE GENERAL ELECTION. ??IF HE GETS ELECTED I??LL DIE? SHE SAID SIMPLY. UP ON EAST 51ST STREET JUST OFF FIFTH AVENUE AND ACROSS FROM ST. PATRICK??S CATHEDRAL ANOTHER HAT AND SCARF VENDOR HAD A DISABLED AMERICAN VETERANS SIGN ON HIS CART. HE DECLINED TO GIVE HIS NAME OR PARTICULARS BUT HE WAS QUICK TO OFFER A WORD OF HIS OWN REGARDING TRUMP HOSTING A VETERANS EVENT ON THURSDAY NIGHT. ??DISGUSTING.? HE WAS UNDERSTANDABLY DUBIOUS OF TRUMP??S NEWFOUND FONDNESS FOR THOSE WHO SERVED. ??NOW HE??S DIFFERENT? THE PEDDLER SAID. ??HE??S BORN AGAIN.? THE PEDDLER DID NOT EXPECT THAT THIS BORN-AGAIN TRUMP WOULD NOW FAVOR ALLOWING DISABLED VETS TO SELL THEIR WARES ON THE GOLDEN AVENUE WHERE HIS TOWER STANDS. ??FIRST CLASS WAR VETS SECOND CLASS BACK-AT-HOMES? THE PEDDLER SAID. HE THEN ADDED ??GO TAKE A PICTURE OF THE PLANTERS.? HE MEANT THE LARGE CEMENT PLANTERS THAT TRUMP HAS PLACED OUTSIDE THE TOWER NOT TO WARD OFF POSSIBLE TERRORISTS BUT TO KEEP AWAY PEDDLERS. AS HAS BEEN REPORTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES TRUMP HAD USED SOMEWHAT SMALLER PLANTERS TO FILL A MARBLE BENCH IN A STRETCH OF THE LOBBY THAT WAS CEDED TO THE PUBLIC IN EXCHANGE FOR HIM BEING ALLOWED TO BUILD 20 STORIES HIGHER THAN ZONING WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE ALLOWED. CITY OFFICIALS NOTED THAT THE PLANTERS ON THE BENCH PREVENTED THE PUBLIC FROM SITTING THERE. TRUMP RESPONDED WITH A 1984 LETTER THAT PRESAGED THE ONES HE WOULD WRITE REGARDING DISABLED VET VENDORS. ??WE HAVE HAD TREMENDOUS DIFFICULTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE BENCH??DRUG ADDICTS VAGRANTS ET CETERA HAVE COME TO THE ATRIUM IN LARGE NUMBERS? TRUMP WROTE IN THE LETTER AS CITED BY THE TIMES. ??ADDITIONALLY ALL SORTS OF ??HORRORS?? HAD BEEN TAKING PLACE THAT EFFECTIVELY RUINED THE BEAUTIFUL AMBIENCE OF THE SPACE WHICH EVERYONE LOVES SO MUCH.? THE CITY FINED TRUMP WHO SUBSEQUENTLY REMOVED THE BENCH ALTOGETHER. HE REPLACED IT WITH AN ELEGANT VERSION OF A HATS AND SCARVES STAND SUCH AS DISABLED VETS MIGHT SET UP ON FIFTH AVENUE IF THEY WERE ALLOWED. ??THE TRUMP STORE? THE SIGN READS. ONE ITEM THAT NO SELF-RESPECTING DISABLED VET PEDDLER WOULD STOCK WAS ON DISPLAY ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON: TRUMP??S BOOK CRIPPLED AMERICA. VET PEDDLERS WHO WERE CRIPPLED IN SERVICE OF AMERICA WOULD LIKELY ONLY SHAKE THEIR HEADS ON SEEING THE REST OF THE TITLE. HOW TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. ONE DISABLED VETERAN WHO HAS BEEN SIDELINED BY MEDICAL TROUBLES IN RECENT DAYS IS DONDI MCKELLAR. HE WAS IN THE NAVY DURING THE 1980S SERVING ABOARD THE USS BOULDER. HE HAS BEEN SELLING BUBBLE BLOWERS IN THE STREET SINCE 2004. ??EVERYBODY GOT THEIR OWN THING BUT BUBBLES MAKE ME HAPPY? HE TOLD THE DAILY BEAST ON WEDNESDAY EVENING. MCKELLAR IS PRESENTLY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE VETERANS COMMITTEE AT THE STREET VENDOR??S PROJECT AND AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN THE EFFORT BY VETERANS 4 VETERANS TO RELAX CURRENT REGULATIONS. THE IDEA IS TO RESTORE FULLY THE PROMISE THE NEW YORK STATE LEGISLATURE MADE IN 1894 THAT DISABLED VETERANS WOULD BE FREE TO SELL GOODS IN THE STREET. ??WE??RE PART OF WHY WE HAVE THE FREEDOM WE HAVE? MCKELLAR NOTED. ??THIS COUNTRY WE SERVED SHOULD GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME OUT AND VEND.? HE WISHES BIG BUSINESS FOLKS WERE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THE VENDORS AS FELLOW BUSINESS FOLKS. ??WE HAVE TO START SOMEWHERE? MCKELLAR SAID. MEANWHILE PEOPLE IN NEW YORK SHOULD KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR THE YELLOW LICENSES OR THE BLUE LICENSES THAT SIGNAL A VENDOR IS A DISABLED VETERAN. ??I WOULD APPRECIATE IT? MCKELLAR SAID. ??ALL MY FELLOW VETERANS WOULD AS WELL IF THAT WOULD GIVE YOU A REASON TO COME OVER.? HE FIGURES WE SHOULD ALL REJOICE AT THE THOUGHT OF DISABLED VETERANS STRUGGLING TO MAKE THEIR WAY ON THE SAME BLOCK AS TRUMP TOWER. ??IT IS WHAT MAKES AMERICA GREAT WE HAVE SUCH A GREAT VARIETY OF EVERYTHING? MCKELLAR SAID. HE DOES NOT EXPECT THAT THE DAY WILL COME WHEN TRUMP WOULD WELCOME HIM. ??HE WOULDN??T HAVE LIKED ME IN FRONT OF HIS ESTABLISHMENT? MCKELLAR SAID. HE SUSPECTS TRUMP MIGHT BE THAT RARE PERSON WHO PROVES IMMUNE TO THE CHARM OF HIS BUBBLES WHICH SEEM TO MAKE ALMOST EVERYBODY SMILE. ??IF HE GETS UPSET WITH MY BUBBLES??? MCKELLAR BEGAN. MCKELLAR THEN SAID ??HE GET UPSET WITH MEGYN KELLY SO I DON??T PUT IT PAST HIM.? ,154738.0

ADDED INTO THE MIX LAST YEAR WAS SEATTLE SEAHAWKS PRO BOWL QUARTERBACK RUSSELL WILSON WHO IS NOW ENGAGED TO CIARA??WHICH DRAWS HIM INTO FUTURE??S CROSSHAIRS. BUT FUTURE??S LATEST OUTBURST WAS DIRECTED SQUARELY AT CIARA. THE ROBO-VOICED EMO RHYMER BLASTED HIS EX VIA TWITTER??BECAUSE THAT??S WHAT FAMOUS RAPPERS DO NOWADAYS??AND INDICATED THAT CIARA ISN??T ALLOWING HIM TO SEE HIS SON. ??I GOTTA GO THROUGH LAWYERS TO SEE BABYFUTURE...THE FUCKERY FOR 15K A MONTH [SIC]? FUTURE TWEETED. ??I JUS WANT BABYFUTURE THAT'S ALL.

FUTURE AND CIARA??S RELATIONSHIP HAS UNFOLDED IN THE PUBLIC EYE??WHICH ISN??T AT ALL UNCOMMON IN THE CASE OF CELEBRITIES BUT PARTICULARLY NOT UNUSUAL SINCE THE ADVENT OF SOCIAL MEDIA. BUT THERE HAS BEEN A SIMMERING UNDERCURRENT OF DISRESPECT WHICH SEEMED TO CULMINATE IN FUTURE??S TWEETS MONDAY. A DISAGREEMENT OVER CHILD SUPPORT DOESN??T HAVE TO DEVOLVE INTO A FAMOUS MAN PUBLICLY CALLING THE ALSO-FAMOUS MOTHER OF HIS CHILD A ??BITCH? BUT THE ????COMMAS? CROONER HAS ALREADY SHOWN THAT HE??S NOT ABOVE THIS SORT OF THING. LAST SUMMER FUTURE TOOK SHOTS AT CIARA AND WILSON VIA TWITTER AFTER PHOTOS HIT THE INTERNET SHOWING THE COUPLE TOGETHER PUSHING LITTLE FUTURE ZAHIR. \NEVER MAKE A PERMANENT DECISION OVER A TEMPORARY CIRCUMSTANCE\"" HE TWEETED AT THE TIME IN WHAT WAS A NOT-AT-ALL-SUBTLE DIG AT HIS FORMER FIANC??E.

THE DEVIL GONE COME FROM ALL ANGLES BUT I'M COVERED WITH ANGELS.\"" FUTURE ELABORATED ON HIS DISGUST IN A LATER INTERVIEW WITH THE BREAKFAST CLUB. ??AT THE END OF THE DAY I??M NOT FOR THE PUBLICITY STUNT? FUTURE SAID. ??LEAVE MY SON OUT OF ALL THE PUBLICITY S??T.

YOU NEVER DO THAT IN OUR COMMUNITY. YOU DON??T EVEN BRING A MAN AROUND YOUR SON. YOU ONLY KNOW THIS DUDE FOR A FEW MONTHS AND YOU??RE BRINGING HIM AROUND YOUR KID? WHO DOES THAT? NOBODY DOES THAT.? MOST IMPORTANTLY THIS LATEST CELEBRITY SPAT OFFERED ANOTHER WINDOW INTO A WIDER CULTURAL PERSPECTIVE. THERE ARE THOSE WHO BELIEVE THAT CHILD SUPPORT IS A MEANS TO ??PUNISH? A FATHER AND THE REACTIONS TO FUTURE??S TWEETS REVEALED THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON??T NEED MUCH EVIDENCE TO DEEM A FAMOUS DAD A VICTIM OF A GREEDY WOMAN. CIARA HAS ADDRESSED THE CRITICISM SHE??S RECEIVED FROM MEN REGARDING HER DECISION TO BRING WILSON SO CLOSE TO HER SON. SHE REMINDED EVERYONE THAT SHE TRIED TO BUILD A STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH FUTURE??S OTHER CHILDREN WHILE THEY WERE TOGETHER. \""IT'S BEEN INTERESTING TO HEAR ABOUT WHAT A LOT OF GUYS HAVE HAD TO SAY.

IT'S KIND OF LIKE WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE HERE?\"" FUTURE HAS THREE OTHER CHILDREN BESIDES FUTURE ZAHIR. IT??S UNLIKELY THAT HE??S UNFAMILIAR WITH CHILD SUPPORT PROCEEDINGS.

NONETHELESS INDIVIDUALS VOICED THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE HIP-HOP STAR TWEETING ABOUT CIARA??S ??DEPENDENCE? ON FUTURE AND THE ILLS OF THE CHILD SUPPORT SYSTEM??NAMELY HOW IT??S USED TO VICTIMIZED MEN. THERE IS A TENDENCY TO VIEW BLACK WOMEN AS TOOLS OF AN OPPRESSIVE SYSTEM INSTEAD OF UNDERSTANDING THAT MEN MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR BEHAVIOR AND TO THE WOMEN WITH WHOM THEY HAVE A CHILD. CHILD SUPPORT IS JUST THAT??CIARA??S DEPENDENCE OR INDEPENDENCE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT FUTURE NEEDS TO PROVIDE FOR HIS SON. EACH PARENT IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THE SAME LIFESTYLE THEY WOULD HAVE HAD IF NO SPLIT EVER OCCURRED. WHY IS HER CHARACTER UNDER SCRUTINY? COULD YOU LISTEN TO LYRICS LIKE ??MONEY COMIN?? FAST WE NEVER GETTING?? SLEEP / I JUST HAD TO BUY ANOTHER SAFE? KNOWING THAT THE GUY BEHIND THOSE LYRICS FEELS PERSECUTED FOR HAVING TO PAY $15000 A MONTH IN CHILD SUPPORT? ?ŸARTISTS WHO DEVOTE SO MUCH OF THEIR MUSIC TO HOW MUCH THEY SPEND ON CARS CLOTHES STRIPPERS AND WATCHES SHOULDN??T EXPECT MUCH SYMPATHY FROM THE PUBLIC REGARDING CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS. OUTSIDE COMMENTATORS DON??T NEED TO KNOW THE SPECIFICS OF A CELEBRITY SPLIT BUT ALSO NEED NOT BE SO EAGER TO DROP THE BALLERIFIC FA??ADE WHEN IT??S TIME TO FORK OVER MONEY FOR YOUR EX AND CHILD. AND TO THE INDIVIDUALS WORKING 9-TO-5S LISTENING TO WISH-FULFILLMENT ANTHEMS AND LIVING VICARIOUSLY THROUGH THEIR FAVORITE STARS MAYBE BE A LITTLE LESS EAGER TO JUSTIFY THEIR SELF-MARTYRDOM. FUTURE AND CIARA??S SITUATION IS PERSONAL AND NO DOUBT VERY DIFFICULT. YOU DON??T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT IT TO SUPPORT HIM AND YOU DEFINITELY DON??T KNOW ENOUGH TO VILIFY HER. WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THE PUBLIC DISRESPECT IS COMING FROM ONE SIDE. AND THE FACT THAT HIS DISRESPECT IS BEING APPLAUDED SPEAKS VOLUMES. EVENTUALLY MOST EX-COUPLES PUT ASIDE THE BITTERNESS FOR THE SAKE OF THE CHILD. FUTURE WOULD DO WELL TO REMEMBER THAT BEFORE HE HOPS ON TWITTER AGAIN.

AND THIS WAS WHEN FRED COUCH WENT IN FOR ANOTHER MEA CULPA. ??HE CAME UP TO ME AND WANTED TO SHAKE MY HAND? SHE SAID. ??I JUST KIND OF BACKED AWAY AND HE SAID ??I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU ONE PARENT TO ANOTHER HOW SORRY I AM THAT THIS HAPPENED.?? ??I SAID ??I??M SORRY TOO THAT THIS HAPPENED. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO TO FIX IT??? AND HE TOLD ME ??WELL WE??RE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING TO MAKE SURE THIS IS FIXED.

YEAH TOTALLY STAGED.? *** BEFORE HER UNTIMELY DEMISE BREANNA MITCHELL WAS BELOVED. ??SHE INFLUENCED PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD? THE SINGLE MOTHER SAID NOTING THAT THERE WERE SOLDIERS WHO HAD GROWN-UP WITH HER DAUGHTER THAT HAD REACHED OUT WHILE STATIONED OVERSEAS IN AFGHANISTAN AND EUROPE AND THEY WANTED TO CUT THEIR TOURS SHORT JUST TO BE BACK FOR BREANNA??S MEMORIAL. ??THEY TOLD ME ??WE??RE ASKING TO END OUR TERM AND COME BACK HOME. SHE WAS OUR FAMILY.??? RAISING FIVE CHILDREN ON HER HOUSE-CLEANING PAYCHECK BY HERSELF SINCE 2001 WHEN SHE SAYS HER HUSBAND BAILED ON THE CHILD SUPPORT AND ABANDONED HIS FAMILY TO BECOME A ROADIE FOR MUSIC BANDS MARLA ADMITS THAT BREANNA WAS HER PRIDE AND JOY. ??IT TOOK ME FIVE TO GET IT RIGHT AND SHE WAS THE BEST OF FIVE? SHE SAID. BREANNA HAD ALREADY EARNED ACCLAIM IN DALLAS WHERE SHE GRADUATED WITH HONORS FROM THE ART INSTITUTE OF DALLAS AND HAD LANDED A FULL-TIME CHEF GIG WITH A RESTAURANT RUN THE BASS BROTHERS (RATED BY FORBES?? THE 29TH RICHEST FAMILY IN THE U.S.) AND FROM THE FIRST SHE MADE SURE HER MOTHER WOULD HAVE A LITTLE COMFORT IN HER LIFE. BREANNA OPTED FOR SO MUCH INSURANCE AND EXTRAS WHEN SHE WAS HIRED ON THAT AN HR MANAGER TOOK HER ASIDE. ??THEY TOLD HER ??WE??VE HAD EMPLOYEES THAT HAVE WORKED US FOR 20 YEARS THAT HAVE NEVER ASKED FOR AS MUCH INSURANCE AND BENEFITS AS YOU WANT. WHY DID YOU FILL OUT FOR ALL THIS EXTRA AND ADDED??? ??SHE SAID ??I WANT TO MAKE SURE MY MAMA IS TAKEN CARE OF FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE.?? I HAD NO CLUE. NO CLUE? MARLA SAID THROUGH MORE TEARS. REFUSING TO LET MELANCHOLY CONSUME HER LIFE THE MOTHER HAS MAINTAINED HER DAUGHTER??S PRESENCE EVERYWHERE SHE TURNS. BREANNA??S TWO RESCUE DOGS STILL SNIFF AT HER CHEF??S SHOES THE BUTTERFLY WIND CHIMES SHE MADE IN GRADE SCHOOL STILL MAKE MUSIC BREANNA??S HAIR TIES OPEN AND CLOSE THE CURTAINS AND HER TEXAS LONGHORN ORNAMENT WITH THE TWO POM-POMS (WHEN SHE WAS A TOT CHEERLEADER) DANGLE ON THE CHRISTMAS TREE. ??YOU CAN EITHER CHOOSE TO BURY IT AND LET IT DIE OR YOU CAN HELP THE WORLD AND EVERYONE THAT LOVED HER AND LEARN TO CELEBRATE THAT BECAUSE SHE??S NOT GONE? MARLA SAID. *** MARLA WORRIES THAT ETHAN COUCH WILL BE SPARED AGAIN. ??THE JUSTICE SYSTEM HAS FAILED THE WHOLE WORLD? SHE SAID. ??LOOK AT CHICAGO LOOK AT OTHER PEOPLE??IT??S NOT JUST US.? COUCH IS IN MEXICO FOR THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE BUT AFTER EXHAUSTING ALL HIS LEGAL EFFORTS HE??LL LIKELY BE EXTRADITED BACK TO TARRANT COUNTY WHERE THE PROCESS IS UNDERWAY TO ENSURE THAT THE 18-YEAR-OLD??S CASE IS UPPED FROM THAT OF A JUVENILE TO AN ADULT. MARLA WHO READS THE BIBLE WITH HER OUTLAW BIKER FRIENDS SAID SHE??S OFTEN CONSIDERED TAKING JUSTICE INTO HER OWN HANDS. ??I SAID IT??S A GOOD THING I DIDN??T CHOOSE TO GO TO MEXICO BECAUSE THERE WOULD BE HOGTIE AND DUCT TAPE INVOLVED WHEN THEY FOUND ME WITH THESE PEOPLE? SHE SAID. THE MOMENTARY FLASH OF ANGER STOPS ALMOST AS FAST AS IT STARTS. ??THANK GOD FOR THE CHRISTIAN WOMAN IN ME? SHE SAID. ??I CAN??T EXECUTE THOSE KIND OF ORDERS BECAUSE GOD HOLDS ME ACCOUNTABLE AND SO DOES MY DAUGHTER.? FAITH HAS SUSTAINED HER BUT IT ALMOST ABANDONED HER TOO. ??I FELT LIKE I EXPERIENCED A LOT OF THINGS IN MY LIFETIME BUT THIS ALMOST BROKE ME. THIS ALMOST BROKE MY FAITH. AND THAT??S THE ONLY THING I HAD TO HOLD ONTO.? TOO MANY TIMES MARLA WISHED SHE COULD HAVE TRADED PLACES WITH HER DAUGHTER. ??FOR ME SUFFERING IS STAYING ALIVE? SHE SAID. ??I PRAYED FOR MONTHS ??GOD TAKE MY LAST BREATH. TAKE ME HOME. WHY? WHY AM I THE ONE LEFT HERE??? AND HE SAYS ??I HAVE YOU WAKING UP EVERY DAY FOR A REASON. DEAL WITH IT.?? ??SO I PUT ON MY BOOTS AND ASK HIM: ??WHAT HAVE YOU GOT FOR ME TODAY LORD???? THE FACT THAT COUCH IS BACK IN CUSTODY AFFORDS BREANNA??S MOTHER SOME SOLACE IN HER OTHERWISE RAVAGED LIFE. AND SHE HOPES HER DAUGHTER??S KILLER IS CAGED FOR A LONG TIME TO COME. ??I JUST WANT TO SIT IN MY YARD AND PUT MY FEET IN THE RIVER AND WATCH BREANNA??S DOGS PLAY AND NOT HAVE TO WORRY ANYMORE AND JUST KNOW THAT HE CAN??T DO ANYTHING HORRIBLE AGAIN AND HE CAN??T MAKE ANYBODY ELSE SUFFER.? ,252525.0

HE WAS ADORABLY ARCH IN GALAXY QUEST (ALL AUTOGRAPH SIGNINGS SHOULD BE CONDUCTED THUS). I KNOW HE WAS A GREAT WITHERING SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM AND A BESUITED BADDIE IN DIE HARD.

BUT ALAN RICKMAN??S BEST FILM FOR THIS RICKMAN FAN ANYWAY WAS AND WILL ALWAYS BE TRULY MADLY DEEPLY WHICH HAS BEEN BARELY MENTIONED TODAY AND IS SUCH A FINE FILM AND SHOWS SUCH A RANGE OF ALAN RICKMAN??FAR BEYOND THE BADDIE??THAT I WANT EVERYONE TO WATCH IT BOX OF TISSUES AT HAND.?Ÿ THIS 1991 BRITISH MOVIE SAW HIM PLAY A GHOST A GUY CALLED JAMIE WHO HAS DIED AND WHO RETURNS TO THE LIVING WORLD??WELL WE ASSUME IT IS IT MAY BE A FIGMENT OF HER IMAGINATION??OF NINA HIS GIRLFRIEND PLAYED BY JULIET STEVENSON. JAMIE HAD BEEN A CELLIST (NINA IS AN INTERPRETER) AND THE MUSIC IN THIS WONDERFUL FILM SCORED BY BARRINGTON PHELOUNG IS A CHARACTER IN ITS OWN RIGHT. SO IS LONDON WHICH DIRECTOR ANTHONY MINGHELLA USES AS A BOTH GRITTY AND CHARMING BACKDROP WHETHER IT BE CAPTURING TELEPHONE NUMBERS SCRAWLED ON HANDS FROM THE WINDOWS OF HASTENING DOUBLE-DECKER RED BUSES OR A SWEET FIRST DATE ON THE SOUTH BANK.?Ÿ WE WATCH AS JAMIE RE-INSTALLS HIMSELF IN NINA??S LIFE TURNING UP HER HEATING TO TROPICAL LEVELS BECAUSE HE'S ALWAYS COLD??AND THEIR CONNECTION ALWAYS INTENSE AND REASSERTED THROUGH MUSIC. RICKMAN IS TRANSFIXING: HE IS LOVING AND SELFISH AND A GHOST SO SURE OF HIS PLACE AND NOT SURE OF HIS PLACE. HE IS STILL INSISTENT ON A PART IN THE WORLD EVEN THOUGH HE KNOWS HE IS NO LONGER OF IT. THE TRAJECTORY OF THIS FAR-FROM MAWKISH OR MANIPULATIVE FILM IS TO FOLLOW NINA LETTING GO??OF JAMIE OF THEIR LOVE. IF IT SOUNDS LIKE GHOST YES IT SHARES A FILM BUT NONE OF THE PREDICTABLE EMOTION-SAPPING CUES. NINA MEETS A LOVELY GUY WHO WORKS WITH DISABLED KIDS PLAYED BY MICHAEL MALONEY WHO ASSUMES??BECAUSE SHE DOESN??T WANT HIM TO KNOW WHERE SHE LIVES??THAT SHE IS LIVING WITH SOMEONE ELSE. HOW CAN SHE TELL HIM SHE IS LIVING WITH HER DEAD PARTNER??S GHOST? JAMIE??S SELFISH BEHAVIOR DURING THE FILM CAN BE SEEN AS HELPING NINA LET GO OF REMOVING THE IDEALIZED HALO SHE HAS PLACED AROUND HER MEMORY OF HIM. HE INVITES OTHER GHOSTS BACK TO THE FLAT TO WATCH VIDEOS.?Ÿ ??DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THERE ARE DEAD PEOPLE IN MY LIVING ROOM WATCHING VIDEOS?? NINA ASKS JAMIE. THE GHOSTS COMPLAIN LOUDLY WHEN IT IS DISCOVERED SHE HAS TAPED OVER WOODY ALLEN??S MANHATTAN. YOU CAN SEE THE FILM AS AN EXTENDED METAPHOR AROUND LOSS. YOU CAN SEE JAMIE??S PRESENCE AS WHOLLY IMAGINED BY NINA. BUT AT ITS POWERFUL HEART??AND YOU WILL ABSOLUTELY CRY BUCKETS WATCHING IT??TRULY MADLY DEEPLY SO EXQUISITELY ACTED BY ALL ITS PLAYERS BUT PARTICULARLY RICKMAN AND STEVENSON IS ABOUT LOSS GRIEF LETTING GO MEMORY AND FINALLY MOVING ON. THE FINAL SCENE BRINGS THE GHOST WORLD AND THE LIVING WORLD AND NINA??S POSSIBLE FUTURE POWERFULLY TOGETHER.?Ÿ THE GREAT TRICK AND INTELLIGENCE OF THE FILM IS THAT THE LOVE STORY IT IS ROOTED IN IS BETWEEN RICKMAN AND STEVENSON BUT THE ENDING YOU??RE ROOTING FOR IS FOR THEM TO BE FINALLY APART. ?Ÿ GRIEF TETHERS US TRULY MADLY DEEPLY TELLS US AND WHILE THAT IS NATURAL LETTING IT BECOME A CONSTANT ANCHOR??AS TIME GOES ON??ONLY IMPEDES OUR ABILITY TO FIND NEW WAYS OF LIVING AND LOVING.?Ÿ AND NOW RICKMAN REALLY HAS JOINED THAT SPIRIT WORLD.

942,10140017.0,2016-01-21T05:01:00+00:00,BOOKIES: GO BIG ON DONALD TRUMP (AND EVEN BIGGER ON HILLARY CLINTON),THE MOST CYNICAL OBSERVERS OF THE 2016 AMERICAN ELECTIONS ARE IN IT FOR THE MONEY??AND MANY OF THEM DON??T EVEN LIVE IN THE UNITED STATES. TEN MONTHS BEFORE ELECTION DAY MEMBERS OF THE U.K.-BASED GAMBLING SITE BETFAIR HAVE SPENT OVER $4.4 MILLION BETTING ON THE OUTCOME OF THE U.S.??S PRIMARY AND GENERAL ELECTIONS. IT??S A MARKET WHERE VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN WHO SWORE OFF A PRESIDENTIAL RUN IN OCTOBER CURRENTLY HAS BETTER ODDS TO WIN THE PRESIDENCY THAN CHRIS CHRISTIE OR MARTIN O??MALLEY. ON SOME SITES THAT ACCEPT BIDS ON THE 2016 ELECTION ELIZABETH WARREN AL GORE AND MICHAEL BLOOMBERG CURRENTLY HAVE A FAR BETTER SHOT AT THE PRESIDENCY THAN A 509-TO-1 BET ON BEN CARSON THE REPUBLICAN POLLING AT 11 PERCENT IN IOWA. ACCORDING TO GAMBLERS BETTING MARKETS ARE MORE ACCURATE THAN POLLS FOR PREDICTING ELECTIONS. A MAJORITY OF BETFAIR USERS CORRECTLY PREDICTED THE WINNERS OF THE 2004 2008 AND 2012 GENERAL ELECTIONS AFTER THE RACES WERE REDUCED TO TWO CANDIDATES. WHEREAS POLLS FLUCTUATE BY WEEK BY LOCATION OR BY POLLING AGENCY BETTING MARKETS TEND TO EXHIBIT MORE STABLE TRENDS. BUT THIS ELECTION CYCLE HAS THROWN EVEN THE MOST STATISTICALLY-MINDED GAMBLERS FOR A LOOP. TODAY A DOLLAR BET ON A DONALD TRUMP PRIMARY VICTORY WILL TURN A PROFIT OF $1.52 ON BETFAIR. HIS ODDS ARE RANKED THE BEST OF ANY GOP CANDIDATE ON THE SITE. TRUMP??S SHARE PRICE TO WIN THE ENTIRE ELECTION REACHED ITS ALL-TIME HIGH WEDNESDAY ON PREDICTIT A SITE THAT ALLOWS USERS TO TRADE FUTURES ON CANDIDATES?? CHANCES. TRUMP??S PRICE SITS TIED WITH BERNIE SANDERS FOR SECOND PLACE AT 27 CENTS AND 16 CENTS BEHIND LEADER HILLARY CLINTON. AT 48 CENTS PER SHARE AT PRESS TIME TRUMP HOLDS A 23-CENT LEAD OVER MARCO RUBIO FOR THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION. TRUMP IS NOW SURGING ON THE SITE UP 11 CENTS WEEK OVER WEEK AND 5 CENTS ON WEDNESDAY ALONE. BUT WHILE TRUMP??S POLL NUMBERS HAVE CHARTED SKY-HIGH SINCE HIS SUMMER CAMPAIGN LAUNCH THE BETTING MARKETS HAVE BEEN SLOW TO INVEST. EARLIER THIS SUMMER A DOLLAR BET ON TRUMP WOULD EARN A RETURN OF NEARLY $350 ON BETFAIR WHILE FIRST JEB BUSH THEN MARCO RUBIO LED AS THE BETTING MAN??S FAVORITE. ??FOR 30 OR 40 WEEKS IN A ROW WE SAW JEB BUSH AHEAD THEN RUBIO PULLED AHEAD OF HIM. AROUND DECEMBER 1ST TRADING ON THE SITE WENT UP SIGNIFICANTLY AND RECENTLY TRUMP PULLED AHEAD? SAID PREDICTIT SPOKESPERSON BRANDI TRAVIS. ??IT SAYS THAT PEOPLE DIDN??T REALLY THINK HE WOULD GET THE NOMINATION UNTIL AROUND NOW.? ACCORDING TO PREDICTION MARKETS EXPERTS THESE LATE-IN-THE-GAME LEAD CHANGES REFLECT UNUSUAL VOLATILITY IN THE BETTING MARKET ONE THAT SUGGESTS A DEEPER DIVIDE IN GOP POLITICS. ??I THINK THAT WHAT??S DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS YEAR IS THAT YOU HAVE PEOPLE WITH STRONG BUT INCOMPATIBLE OPINIONS? SAYS RAJIV SETHI A PROFESSOR AT BARNARD COLLEGE WHO HAS PUBLISHED A STUDY ON PATTERNS IN POLITICAL BETTING MARKETS. ??THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE FELT PEOPLE WHO HAVE PUBLICLY EXPRESSED THE VIEW THAT TRUMP COULDN??T POSSIBLY BE THE NOMINEE. THEY FELT VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THAT AND VERY COMFORTABLE BETTING AGAINST THAT OUTCOME. AND REALLY THAT VIEW HAS STARTED TO CHANGE. THE RISE OF TRUMP IN THE PREDICTION MARKETS HAS BEEN DRIVEN BY THE BREAKDOWN OF THE NARRATIVE THAT HE COULDN??T POSSIBLY WIN.? FOR A MARKET THAT PRIDES ITSELF ON OBJECTIVITY POLITICAL GAMBLING HAS TRIPPED OVER THE SAME JUDGEMENT AS TELEVISION HOSTS: THAT SOMETHING WOULD INEVITABLY LEAD TO DONALD TRUMP??S DOWNFALL BE IT HIS ATTACKS ON IMMIGRANTS HIS CRITICISM OF JOHN MCCAIN??S WAR RECORD HIS ANTI-ISLAM RHETORIC OR THAT HE ONCE TRIED AND FAILED TO SELL ??EXTREMELY GREASY? FROZEN STEAKS AT THE SHARPER IMAGE. DAVID ROTHSCHILD AN ECONOMIST WHO RUNS PREDICTION TRACKING SITE PREDICTWISE SAYS THE BETTING MARKETS FINALLY CAME TO TERMS WITH TRUMP AT THE BEGINNING OF THE NEW YEAR. ??YOU REALLY SEE THIS KIND OF CROSSING SOMETIME AROUND JANUARY 1 WHERE TRUMP STARTED TO REALLY SHOOT UP? ROTHSCHILD SAYS. ACCORDING TO PREDICTIT??S INTERNAL DATA TRUMP AND SANDERS BOTH MOVED INTO 2ND AND 3RD PLACE RESPECTIVELY RIGHT AROUND CHRISTMAS. TRUMP HAS ENJOYED A CONSISTENT LEAD OVER TED CRUZ FOR THE GOP NOD SINCE JANUARY 6TH. ROTHSCHILD LINKS TRUMP??S UPSHOT TO HIS COMEBACK AFTER A BRIEF POLLING DROP IN IOWA. ??IN THE POLLING FOR A LITTLE BIT I THINK PEOPLE SAW IT AS ??IT??S FINALLY GOING TO HAPPEN?? THE FIRST TIME HE LOST AFTER LEADING SOMETHING??BUT THEN HE BOUNCED BACK IN THE POLLS IN IOWA AND CONTINUED TO HOLD FIRM IN NEW HAMPSHIRE? HE SAID. ??I THINK IN MANY SENSES IT??S JUST A MATTER OF TIME SLIPPING AWAY.? TRUMP??S NEW ACCEPTANCE IN BETTING MARKETS ALSO INDICATES A TREND TOWARDS A BROADER ACCEPTANCE OF ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES ROTHSCHILD BELIEVES. HE CLASSIFIES THE GOP RACE AS NOT ONE ELECTION BUT TWO ??SEMIFINAL? BATTLES BETWEEN ESTABLISHMENT CANDIDATES LIKE JEB BUSH AND MARCO RUBIO AND ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT CANDIDATES LIKE TRUMP AND TED CRUZ. ??YOU SAW A SENSE OF STABILITY IN THE SENSE THAT AS JEB BUSH WENT DOWN AND RUBIO WENT UP. THEY KIND OF TRADED OFF THAT WEIGHT? HE SAYS OF EARLIER BETTING MARKETS. ??AND SIMILARLY YOU??LL SEE NOW THAT AS TRUMP HAS HELD ON FIRM IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS AGAINST CRUZ??S CHARGE YOU SEE THEM KIND OF TRADE OFF SUPPORT IN THE MARKET. OVERALL YOU SEE THE MARKETS TEND TO GIVE INCREMENTALLY MORE WEIGHT TO THE NON-ESTABLISHMENT AS THE CANDIDATES HAVE PROGRESSED INTO THE YEAR 2016.? AS TIME DWINDLES IN THE PRIMARY COMPETITION A BET AGAINST TRUMP IS BECOMING A TRUE GAMBLE. AND EVEN THOSE WHO BELIEVE HE WILL FAIL IN THE GENERAL ELECTION (WHERE BETFAIR VALUES HILLARY CLINTON AT OVERWHELMING ODDS) WOULD RATHER BET ON TRUMP THAN RISK ON RUBIO. BUT FOR THOSE LOOKING TO PREDICT THE NEXT PRESIDENT SETHI CAUTIONS THAT READING THE BETTING MARKETS CAN BE A ??CHICKEN AND EGG? SITUATION. ??WE DON??T KNOW YET WHETHER THE PRICES MOVED FIRST OR THE CHANGE IN PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS OF THE RACE? HE SAYS. ??IT??S AN INTERESTING QUESTION BUT WILL TAKE SOME TIME AND CAREFUL EMPIRICAL WORK TO ANSWER.? IT??S WORTH NOTING THAT THESE SITES SKEW TOWARDS A PARTICULAR KIND OF PERSON: AN INTERNET-SAVVY GAMBLER WITH SOME MONEY TO SPARE AND AN INTEREST IN NATIONAL POLITICS. ??WE SKEW HEAVILY MALE WITH MOST OF OUR USERS BETWEEN THE AGES OF 20 AND THEIR LATE 30S? SAID PREDICTIT??S TRAVIS. ACCORDING TO DATA SENT TO THE DAILY BEAST FROM PREDICTIT 9939 OF THE SITE??S 19247 TRADES??OR 52 PERCENT??WERE MADE BY USERS BETWEEN THE AGES OF 20 AND 30. OVER 4300 OF THOSE TRADES CAME FROM USERS IN EITHER NEW YORK OR CALIFORNIA. EVEN WITH ITS HOMOGENOUS USERBASE TRAVIS SAYS PREDICTIT IS A MUCH BETTER INDICATOR THAN ONE MIGHT THINK. IT IS AFTER ALL THE ONLY U.S.-BASED ONLINE PREDICTION MARKET SINCE INTRADE??S SHUTDOWN IN 2013. AND SINCE REAL MONEY IS ON THE LINE TRAVIS SAYS SHE??S LEARNED USERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BET WITH THEIR WALLETS THAN WITH THEIR HEARTS. ??I TALK TO THE TRADERS WHO SHOW UP TO [PREDICTIT] EVENTS AND THEY SAY ??THERE??S NO WAY I WOULD EVER VOTE FOR SAY HILLARY CLINTON BUT THAT??S WHO I WOULD PUT MY MONEY ON??? SHE SAID. AND THE NUMBERS BACK THAT UP: A 2008 UNIVERSITY OF IOWA STUDY CONCLUDED THAT PREDICTION MARKETS ARE ??74 PERCENT CLOSER TO THE ACTUAL OUTCOME? THAN POLLING AND THE RESULTS GET EVEN MORE ACCURATE 100 DAYS OUT FROM A VOTE. ??IT??S WHAT YOU THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN? SAID TRAVIS. ??NOT WHAT YOU WANT.? ,10152.0

DESPITE BOMBS GOING OFF A HOSTAGE TAKING AND AN EXTENDED GUNFIGHT WITH INDONESIAN POLICE AROUND THAMRIN STREET (NEAR SEVERAL EMBASSIES LUXURY HOTELS AND THE OFFICES OF THE UNITED NATIONS) CASUALTIES WERE FAIRLY LOW BY THE STANDARDS OF MODERN TERRORISM. INITIAL REPORTS SAY SEVEN PEOPLE DIED INCLUDING FIVE ATTACKERS WHICH WOULD SEEM BOTH A CREDIT TO THE RESPONSE OF THE INDONESIAN AUTHORITIES AND A REFLECTION OF THE KILLERS?? INEPTITUDE. A WEB SITE LINKED TO THE SO-CALLED ??ISLAMIC STATE? CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY IN THE NAME OF THE PUTATIVE CALIPHATE FOR THE ATTACK ??TARGETING FOREIGN NATIONALS AND THE SECURITY FORCES CHARGED WITH PROTECTING THEM IN THE INDONESIAN CAPITAL.? BACK IN NOVEMBER POLICE REPORTEDLY PICKED UP ISIS CHATTER ABOUT A ??CONCERT? PLANNED FOR INDONESIA AND PERHAPS 100 INDONESIAN CITIZENS ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE JOINED ISIS RANKS IN SYRIA. BUT THE PARTICULAR AFFILIATIONS OF THE MADMEN ARE LESS IMPORTANT THAN THEIR METHOD IN THIS CASE. THE MULTI-PRONGED ATTACK BY SQUADS OF TERRORISTS USING ASSAULT RIFLES AND LOW-GRADE EXPLOSIVES TO SLAUGHTER INNOCENT PEOPLE AT CAFES STADIUMS HOTELS SHOPPING MALLS AND SUCH HAS BECOME STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE FOR TERRORIST GROUPS ALL OVER THE MAP. INDEED THESE TYPES OF OPERATIONS HAVE GROWN SO COMMON THAT WESTERN COUNTER-TERROR ANALYSTS HAVE GIVEN THEM A NEW LABEL MTFAS OR ??MARAUDING TERRORIST FIREARMS ATTACKS.? LAST MONTH THERE WAS SAN BERNARDINO AND THE MONTH BEFORE THAT THE HORRIFIC CARNAGE IN PARIS IN NOVEMBER FOLLOWING ON THE CHARLIE HEBDO AND KOSHER SUPERMARKET KILLINGS IN JANUARY. OTHER MFTAS TO NAME BUT A FEW WOULD INCLUDE THE BEACH ATTACK IN TUNISIA IN JUNE THAT KILLED 38 PEOPLE 30 OF THEM BRITISH THE WESTGATE MALL ATTACK IN NAIROBI IN 2013 (67 DEAD) CARRIED OUT BY AL-SHABAAB AND THE FIRST REALLY FEROCIOUS MULTI-PRONG ATTACKS IN MUMBAI IN 2008 WHEN LASHKAR-E-TAIBA OPERATIVES KILLED 168 PEOPLE. IT??S NOT ALWAYS ISIS BUT SUCH OPERATIONS HAVE ??CREATED THE FEELING THAT THERE??S A GLOBAL THREAT THAT MAY POP OUT ANYWHERE WITHOUT ANY SIGNIFICANT TARGET? SAYS GILLES KEPEL A FRENCH EXPERT ON RADICAL ISLAM. THE MARAUDERS IT SEEMS COULD BE ANYWHERE. ?ŸAND THAT WOULD BE RIGHT IN LINE WITH THE KIND OF RANDOM TERROR ADVOCATED BY IDEOLOGUES LIKE ABU MUSAB AL-SURI AND ABU BAKR AL-NAJI. IT??S PURPOSE IS NOT ONLY TO INSTILL FEAR BUT TO PROVOKE OVERREACTION PITTING THE WORLD AGAINST MUSLIMS AND MUSLIMS AGAINST THE REST OF THE WORLD. THAT??S WHY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND OTHER RESPONSIBLE LEADERS IN THE WEST CAREFULLY TRY TO COOL OFF THE HYPE. BUT AT THE SAME TIME SOME COUNTER-TERROR EXPERTS WARN IF THE THREAT IS UNDER-PLAYED IT MAY NOT BE ADDRESSED AS EFFECTIVELY AS REQUIRED. ON TUESDAY PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA TOLD NBC??S MATT LAUER ON THE TODAY?ŸSHOW THAT DESPITE FEAR-MONGERING BY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP ??THERE ARE NO EXISTENTIAL THREATS FACING US.? WHILE THAT MAY BE TRUE IN THE LARGEST SENSE OBAMA MISSES THE POINT ACCORDING TO A VETERAN OF CIA COUNTER-TERROR ANALYSIS AND OPERATIONS WHO DECLINED TO SPEAK FOR ATTRIBUTION. ??NOTHING IS AN ??EXISTENTIAL THREAT?? UNLESS IT HAPPENS TO YOU? HE SAID. ??THAT??S LIKE SETTING UP A STRAW MAN LIKE IF IT??S NOT AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT YOU CAN DISMISS IT.? IN FACT THESE GLOBAL MARAUDERS ARE CHANGING THE WAY WE LIVE. ??IT SPREADS LIKE AN INFECTION? SAID THE VETERAN AND THE FIGHT AGAINST THEM ??IS GOING TO GO ON AND ON.? THEY MIGHT NOT BRING AN END TO OUR WORLD AS THE NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST FEARED IN THE COLD WAR MIGHT HAVE DONE BUT THEY ALREADY ARE BRINGING TO AN END THE WORLD AS WE??VE KNOWN IT MAKING US SECOND-GUESS WHERE WE TRAVEL AND IN SOME PLACES EVEN HOW WE MOVE AROUND OUR HOME TOWNS. WHAT HAS NOT HAPPENED HOWEVER IS WHAT THE TERRORIST IDEOLOGUES PREDICTED: MASS SUPPORT FOR THE JIHADIST CAUSE. ??YOU CAN ALWAYS PULL TOGETHER A SMALL GROUP FOR AN OPERATION? SAYS KEPEL. ??BUT THEY HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO USE TERRORISM AS A LIGHTNING ROD THAT WILL SHOW THE WAY FOR THE MASSES.? THEIR RECRUITS FOR THE MOST PART ARE LOSERS OUTCASTS AND CRIMINALS AND THEIR NUMBERS ARE RELATIVELY SMALL. THE MUCH-TALKED-ABOUT EUROPEAN RECRUITS TO ISIS FOR INSTANCE NUMBER IN THE HUNDREDS OR LOW THOUSANDS.

505,9845852.0,2016-01-12T05:01:00+00:00,HOW DAVID BOWIE PREDICTED THE COMING OF KANYE WEST,"IN THE PROPHECY IT GOES LIKE THIS. IN THE BEGINNING THERE WAS ZIGGY STARDUST AND ZIGGY STARDUST WAS WITH DAVID BOWIE AND DAVID BOWIE WAS ZIGGY STARDUST. THERE WAS A MAN SENT FROM DAVID BOWIE AND HIS NAME WAS KANYE WEST. YES THERE IS A SOMEWHAT IN JEST SLIGHTLY IN EARNEST WHOLLY HOPEFUL SHARED BELIEF THAT DAVID BOWIE IS GOD OR JESUS OR OTHERWISE SOME KIND OF ALL-KNOWING ETHEREAL MOON BEING (NOTE: THAT LAST PART IS NOT UNLIKELY) AND THAT HE PROPHESIED THE COMING OF KANYE WEST (NOTE: THAT PART IS UNLIKELY). BOWIE FLOATING IN A HEAVEN HE MADE HIMSELF IS NOT AN IDEA THAT BEGAN SUNDAY NIGHT WHEN HE DIED AFTER A SECRET 18-MONTH BATTLE WITH CANCER. THE GOOD WORD HAS BEEN PERCOLATING AROUND THE INTERNET SINCE AT LEAST 2007. BUT IT??S CERTAINLY A COMFORTING THOUGHT THAT THE ROCK STAR WHO SANG FOR THOSE UNCOMFORTABLE ON EARTH MIGHT BE THE ONE CALLING THE SHOTS UP ABOVE. AND HERE??S THE BEST PART: JUST LIKE ANY DECENT CULT ALL OF ITS BELIEVERS THINK THEY WERE THE FIRST AND ONLY TRUE BELIEVERS. FIRST HOWEVER LET??S EXPLAIN HOW KANYE WEST GOT INVOLVED. THE SCRIPTURE BEGINS ON THE COVER OF DAVID BOWIE??S SEMINAL ROCK OPERA THE RISE AND FALL OF ZIGGY STARDUST AND THE SPIDERS FROM MARS RELEASED ON JUNE 6 1972. YOU??LL SEE BOWIE IN HEAVY SATURATION LEG PERCHED ON A RAILING. ABOVE HIS HEAD LIKE A BEACON GLOWS A GOLD SIGN THAT WASN??T ACTUALLY GOLD COLORIZED HOT FROM A BLACK-AND-WHITE PHOTO. ON IT THERE??S THE ONLY LEGIBLE TEXT IN THE SHOT. IN BOLD CAPITAL LETTERS IT READS: K. WEST. K. WEST BY THE WAY WAS A FURRIER ON HEDDON STREET IN LONDON WHERE THE PICTURE WAS SHOT. (IT WAS NOT THE FLAGSHIP STORE FOR KANYE??S PRE-GESTATION CLOTHING LINE.) BUT THAT??S NOT WHY PEOPLE BELIEVE HE??S THE HEIR TO BOWIE??S TIN CAN. THAT BY ITSELF WOULDN??T BE ENOUGH. HERE IS WHY YOU AT LEAST HAVE TO HEAR THEM OUT. TO START FOR TWO REASONS GO TURN ON ZIGGY STARDUST. REASON NO. 1: THERE IS NO REASON NOT TO TURN ON ZIGGY STARDUST. NO. 2: LOOK AT THE TITLE OR SING THE CHORUS OF THE FIRST SONG ON THAT ALBUM. ??FIVE YEARS.? FIVE YEARS AND TWO DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THAT SONG WHICH IS ABOUT THE APOCALYPSE THAT WILL COME AFTER THAT PRECISE AMOUNT OF TIME IT HAPPENED: ON JUNE 8 1977 KANYE WEST WAS BORN. YEEZUS HAD RISEN. THIRTY-SIX YEARS LATER HE??D WRITE A SONG CALLED ??I AM A GOD? ON AN ALBUM CALLED YEEZUS. BUT THE CHURCH OF THE HOLY TRINITY OF ZIGGY AND BOWIE AND YEEZY CAME LONG BEFORE THAT. ??KANYE WHO IS FROM THIS PICTURE [IS] OBVIOUSLY THE JESUS OF THE MUSIC INDUSTRY.? SO BEGINS A BLOG POST FROM 2007 BY BLOGSPOT USER P-EPHRINE. THE PICTURE IN QUESTION IS KANYE WEARING A CROWN OF THORNS ON THE COVER OF ROLLING STONE. ??NOW WHAT ME AND MY ASSOCIATE HAVE COME TO ANSWER IS WHAT KANYE WILL BRING AND HOW DAVID BOWIE PREDICTED THE COMING OF KANYE WEST? P-EPHRINE WRITES. ??WHY ELSE WOULD HE BE UNDER A SIGN THAT SAYS THAT IF HE WASN??T PROCLAIMING THE COMING OF KANYE WHO CAME AND IS GOING TO SAVE US FROM OUR SINS? MAYBE KANYE IS THE SECOND COMING?? P-EPHRINE THEORIZES. LIKE ANY HALF-BAKED IDEA THE BLOG WAS ABANDONED A MONTH LATER. BUT LIKE ANY HALF-BAKED IDEA ON THE INTERNET THIS PUPPY HAD LEGS. IN 2014 A REDDIT USER NAMED BILLMEISTER123 POSITED THE SAME THEORY THIS TIME WITHOUT THE RELIGIOSITY. HE CALLED IT ??DAVID BOWIE PREDICTED KANYE WEST? AND NATURALLY HE POSTED IT TO A SECTION CALLED /R/SHITTYFANTHEORIES. ??THIS IS THE BEST SHITTYFANTHEORY I'VE EVER SEEN? WROTE ONE USER.

RIGHT? ??IT??S JUST ONE OF THESE THINGS THAT EVERYBODY KNEW BUT NOBODY HAD TAKEN THE TIME TO WRITE DOWN? SAID ALISTAIR COLEMAN WHO GOT IT PUT IN THE NEWSPAPER. ??WHEN YOU SEE THE NAME OF IT FLOATING ABOVE HIS HEAD YOU THINK THERE??S GOT TO BE A LINK.? COLEMAN WHO??S A NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER IN THE U.K. LOBBED THE THEORY ON HIS BLOG AS A JOKE JUST LAST YEAR.

(??I??VE NOT GOT MUCH OF [KANYE??S]?? PRODUCT? HE SAID.) SHE LET HIM KNOW: ALMOST FIVE YEARS APART SAVE FOR A BRIEF DELAY. ??I THINK KANYE WAS JUST TWO DAYS LATE TO BEING BORN? HE TOLD THE DAILY BEAST. ??IT HAPPENS.? THE IRISH MIRROR PICKED UP ON IT TWO DAYS AFTER HE POSTED HIS THEORY BUT THE PAPER TOOK THE FUN DYSTOPIAN ROUTE. ??HAS THE APOCALYPSE ALREADY BEGUN?? THE MIRROR ASKED. ??APPARENTLY SO.? BUT NOW BOWIE??S GONE AND THE WORLD??S STILL HERE.

BECAUSE TO HIM IT STILL FEELS LIKE IT. ??I??M HOPING THIS WILL GO ONTO BECOME A PRETTY MUCH MAINSTREAM CONSPIRACY THEORY.

HIS LATEST DIRECTORIAL EFFORT THE HOLLARS SCREENED EARLIER THIS MORNING TO PRESS AND POTENTIAL BUYERS OPPORTUNISTIC POLITICIANS FROM MARCO RUBIO TO TED CRUZ ARE USING HIS MOVIE 13 HOURS: THE SECRET SOLDIERS OF BENGHAZI AS A POLITICAL WEAPON AGAINST PRESIDENTIAL RIVAL HILLARY CLINTON AND HIS NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS ARE LOSING TO THE DENVER BRONCOS IN THE AFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME (KRASINSKI IS A NATIVE OF NEWTON MASS.). ??I THINK I??LL CATCH AT LEAST THE LAST HOUR OR SO OF THE GAME AND I??LL CHECK IN WITH IT? HE SAYS CHUCKLING. ??WHEN YOU??RE IN A MOVIE THAT YOU CARE THIS MUCH ABOUT THESE ARE THE SACRIFICES.? WE??RE HUDDLED TOGETHER IN A CONDO IN PARK CITY UTAH WHERE HIS FILM IS MAKING ITS PREMIERE AS PART OF THE 2016 SUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL. IT??S THE OFFICE STAR??S FOURTH MOVIE AT THE FEST AND HIS SECOND AS DIRECTOR AFTER 2009??S BRIEF INTERVIEWS WITH HIDEOUS MEN. LIKE THAT DAVID FOSTER WALLACE ADAPTATION HE??S ASSEMBLED AN A-LIST CAST WITH THE HOLLARS. KRASINSKI IS JOHN HOLLAR A SMALL-TOWN FELLA WHO MOVED AWAY TO THE BIG APPLE AND SCORED HIM A WONDERFUL RICH GIRLFRIEND (ANNA KENDRICK). DESPITE HER LOOMING PREGNANCY JOHN FINDS HIMSELF STRUGGLING TO POP THE QUESTION. WHEN HIS STRONG-WILLED MOTHER (MARGO MARTINDALE BRILLIANT) FALLS ILL THE HOLLARS ALL UNITE AND ARE FORCED TO ADDRESS THE MYRIAD DEMONS IN THEIR CLOSETS. JOINING THE AFOREMENTIONED TRIO IS SHARLTO COPLEY AS JOHN??S SCREW UP OF A BROTHER RICHARD JENKINS AS HIS WELL-MEANING BUT NA??VE FATHER CHARLIE DAY AS MOM??S NURSE AND MARY ELIZABETH WINSTEAD AS JOHN??S HIGH SCHOOL SQUEEZE. KRASINSKI DIRECTED FROM A SCREENPLAY BY JAMES C. STROUSE AND FOUND HIMSELF RELATING TO THE STORY EVEN THOUGH HE COMES FROM A ??GREAT TIGHT-KNIT FAMILY.? MOSTLY HE RELATED TO JOHN??S DILEMMA: THE EXISTENTIAL CRISIS A MAN FACES WHEN HE??S READY TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PEOPLE OTHER THAN HIMSELF. KRASINSKI WHO IS MARRIED TO THE ACTRESS EMILY BLUNT SAYS THAT THE BIRTH OF THEIR DAUGHTER HAZEL CHANGED HIS ENTIRE OUTLOOK ON LIFE. ??I THINK I WENT THROUGH A REAL EXISTENTIAL MOMENT THAT EVERYBODY WILL TELL YOU ABOUT WHEN YOU HAVE A KID THOUGH IT??S DIFFERENT FOR EVERYBODY? HE SAYS. ??WHEN I HAD MY DAUGHTER I WENT THROUGH AN EXPERIENCE WHERE IT REALLY DOES HOLD UP A MIRROR TO YOUR LIFE WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT. ARE YOU AT THE PLACE WHERE YOU WANT TO BE? ARE YOU HAPPY WITH WHO YOU ARE AS A PERSON?? HAZEL WAS BORN IN FEBRUARY 2014 AND SHOOTING ON THE HOLLARS BEGAN TWO MONTHS LATER. WHILE KRASINSKI FOUND SOME KINSHIP WITH JOHN??S IMPENDING FATHERHOOD DILEMMA THE PART OF JOHN THAT NEEDED TO CLOSE THE BOOK ON HIS LADY-KILLING PAST (SEE: MARY ELIZABETH WINSTEAD) WASN??T CLOSE TO HIS REALITY. ??I??LL BE REALLY HONEST WITH YOU I WAS NEVER THE COOLEST KID ON THE BLOCK SO I NEVER HAD THE ??GOOD OL?? DAYS?? OF A PLAYBOY TYPE OF LIFESTYLE? SAYS A SMILING KRASINSKI. ??MY GOOD OL?? DAYS WERE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT. SO FOR ME THE BEST DAYS OF MY LIFE STARTED WHEN I MET MY WIFE??THAT??S THE TRUTH IT??S NOT JUST ME SAYING IT BECAUSE IT SOUNDS NICE ON A CARD. SHE??S ONE OF THE COOLEST PEOPLE SHE??S SO TALENTED SHE??S BEAUTIFUL AND SHE??S CERTAINLY OUT OF MY LEAGUE. AND SO ALL OF A SUDDEN ALL OF THE THINGS I LOVED I GOT TO FIND SOMEONE WHO LOVED THAT ABOUT ME. THERE WAS A LOT OF MY LIFE THAT SHE HADN??T EXPERIENCED AND A LOT OF HER LIFE THAT I HADN??T EXPERIENCED SO ALL OF A SUDDEN WE GOT TO START DOING THINGS THAT WE LIKED.? HE PAUSES. ??WHEN YOU??RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO MEET YOUR ONE PERSON THEN LIFE TAKES A TURN FOR THE BEST. IT CAN??T GET BETTER THAN THAT.? CURBING SOME OF HIS ENTHUSIASM HOWEVER IS THE WAY THAT POLITICIANS AND POLITICAL PUNDITS HAVE TREATED HIS RECENT FILM 13 HOURS: THE SECRET SOLDIERS OF BENGHAZI??A DRAMATIZATION OF THE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON AN AMERICAN DIPLOMATIC COMPOUND IN BENGHAZI LIBYA ON SEPTEMBER 11 2012. KRASINSKI PLAYS JACK DA SILVA ONE OF A SIX-MEMBER TEAM OF CIA SECURITY CONTRACTORS WHO PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE TO PROTECT THE AMERICANS INSIDE THE COMPOUND INCLUDING AMBASSADOR J. CHRISTOPHER STEVENS WHO WAS ONE OF FOUR AMERICANS TO LOSE THEIR LIVES. THOSE ON RIGHT HAVE USED THE MICHAEL BAY FILM AS A POLITICAL WEAPON AGAINST THEN SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY CLINTON WHO IS CURRENTLY RUNNING FOR POTUS WHILE THOSE ON THE LEFT HAVE DISMISSED THE MOVIE AS ANTI-HILLARY PROPAGANDA. ALL OF THIS HAS WEIGHED ON KRASINSKI WHO BECOMES VERY EMOTIONAL WHEN DISCUSSING HOW THE FILM??S BEEN SPUN. ??I THINK IT??S A SHAME THAT A MOVIE LIKE THIS WOULD BE USED SO MUCH AS A POLITICAL FOOTBALL? HE SAYS. ??NOW I??D BE NA??VE TO SAY THAT PEOPLE WEREN??T GOING TO TAKE THIS POLITICALLY. IF THAT WAS YOUR AGENDA AND YOU WANTED TO SEE THIS MOVIE POLITICALLY THROUGH YOUR OWN LENS YOU WERE GOING TO DO THAT WHETHER WE WANT YOU TO OR NOT. AND THAT??S YOUR RIGHT. WHAT I DON??T THINK IS FAIR AND WHAT I THINK IS A SHAME??AND ACTUALLY I??LL GO SO FAR AS TO SAY A TOTAL DISHONOR??IS TO NOT AT LEAST ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT THIS STORY IS: ACKNOWLEDGING THESE SIX GUYS. THESE SIX GUYS NEED THAT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND THEY REPRESENT THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVE ALL AROUND THE WORLD. SO BY JUST TAKING THIS AS A POLITICAL FOOTBALL OF ??THIS MOVIE IS A TOTAL PROPAGANDA PIECE?? YOU ARE ROBBING PEOPLE OF THE ABILITY TO SEE WHAT THESE MEN AND WOMEN ARE ACTUALLY GOING THROUGH.? ??I AM ACTUALLY SLIGHTLY DISGUSTED AT THE IDEA THAT APPLAUDING OUR MILITARY HAS BECOME A POLITICAL THING RATHER THAN UNIVERSAL? HE CONTINUES. ??IT??S UNIVERSAL. THAT SHOULD BE AN IMMEDIATE ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND THEN ALL THE POLITICAL OPINIONS CONVERSATIONS AND PUNDITRY IS PART OF THE PROCESS. I WOULD NEVER SAY WE SHOULDN??T TALK POLITICALLY ABOUT STUFF??AS LONG AS STEP ONE IS ACKNOWLEDGING THESE GUYS AND WHAT THEY WENT THROUGH THAT NIGHT.? WHILE SOME MEMBERS OF THE LEFT-WING MEDIA HAVE DISMISSED 13 HOURS AS FODDER FOR BENGHAZI CONSPIRACY THEORISTS DEMOCRATIC POLITICIANS HAVE REMAINED RELATIVELY SILENT ON IT. NOT SO ON THE RIGHT WHERE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES MARCO RUBIO AND TED CRUZ HAVE INVOKED THE FILM IN ATTACKS ON HILLARY. ??SHE IS DISQUALIFIED FROM BEING PRESIDENT? SAID RUBIO. ??YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY? JUST WATCH 13 HOURS.? CRUZ DID HIM ONE BETTER BRINGING UP 13 HOURS IN HIS CLOSING STATEMENT DURING A RECENT GOP PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE USING THE MOVIE AS AMMUNITION AGAINST HILLARY. KRASINSKI DIDN??T SEE CRUZ??S MOVIE PITCH??HE WAS FLYING HE SAYS??BUT FINDS IT DISTURBING THAT RUBIO AND CRUZ HAVE CHOSEN TO USE THE MOVIE AS A POLITICAL WEAPON WITHOUT PAYING PROPER TRIBUTE TO THE REAL-LIFE HEROES DEPICTED IN THE FILM. ??I DON??T CARE IF YOU??RE TED CRUZ MARCO RUBIO OR HILLARY CLINTON HERSELF? HE SAYS. ??ALL OF THEM CAN SAFELY SAY THAT IF THE MOVIE SUCCEEDS IN PORTRAYING THESE GUYS AS HEROES THEN THAT??S AN IMPORTANT THING THAT WE SHOULD ALL ACKNOWLEDGE. NOW HERE COMES MY POLITICAL SPIN ON IT: EVEN TED CRUZ FOR HIM NOT TO SAY IT ACKNOWLEDGES OUR HEROES BUT TO MAKE IT ABOUT THAT NIGHT AND CONNECTING IT TO HILLARY YOU??RE ALLOWED TO DO THAT JUST SAY HOW HEROIC THESE GUYS ARE FIRST. GIVE THEM THEIR DUE. AND THEN SAY ??AND NOW I??M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT HOW IT RELATES TO HILLARY CLINTON.?? BUT FOR THE MOST PART THAT??S NOT WHAT??S HAPPENED.? ??I DON??T USUALLY FOLLOW THIS STUFF BUT FOR THIS ONE I TOOK IT PERSONALLY FOR THESE GUYS? HE ADDS. ??WE ALL PUT OUR NAMES ON THE LINE TO MAKE SURE WE DID JUSTICE TO THESE GUYS.? THIS IS KRASINSKI SAYS A TEACHABLE MOMENT. ??THE TRUTH IS WE SHOULD ALL BE PROUD OF THESE GUYS AND THE MOMENT YOU POLITICIZE IT THE MORE YOU??RE MOVING US TOWARD A WORLD THAT I DON??T WANT TO BE LIVING IN A WORLD WHERE PEOPLE WANT TO SCORE POLITICAL POINTS AT ALL COSTS? HE SAYS. ??ON EITHER SIDE THIS IS WHAT I HOPE PEOPLE LEARN: IN MOMENTS LIKE THIS WHEN WE??RE TALKING ABOUT THE MILITARY DON??T SCORE POINTS.

NOSHING FIRST THING IN THE MORNING HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE CONCENTRATION PROVIDE A SUSTAINED SOURCE OF ENERGY UP THE CHANCES OF CONSUMING ENOUGH NUTRIENTS THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND HELP MAINTAIN A HEALTHY BODY WEIGHT. BUT NOT ALL BREAKFASTS ARE CREATED EQUAL. (CUE SCARY MUSIC.) FOR PROOF LOOK NO FURTHER THAN THE ENTRIES ON THIS LIST WHICH RANGE WILDLY IN TERMS OF THE NUTRITION THEY PROVIDE. WITH THE HELP OF SAMANTHA MENDELOWITZ RD LDN WE??VE RANKED SOME OF THE COUNTRY??S MOST POPULAR BREAKFAST ITEMS IN ORDER FROM BEST TO WORST. SIMPLY CONSULT THIS HANDY GUIDE NEXT TIME YOU??RE HAVING TROUBLE FIGURING OUT WHAT CONSTITUTES A TRULY HEALTHY MORNING MEAL. THE BREAKFAST FOODS POWER RANKING: FROM BEST TO WORST 1. EGG SANDWICH PROVIDED IT??S NOT DRIPPING WITH CHEESE AND BACON OR SITTING ON A BAGEL OR CROISSANT THE GOOD OLD BREAKFAST SANDWICH MIGHT ACTUALLY BE YOUR A.M. ALLY. ??THIS IS THE BEST OPTION BECAUSE IT CONTAINS [FOODS FROM] FOUR?ŸOUT OF THE FIVE FOOD GROUPS ?? STARCH PROTEIN VEGETABLE AND DAIRY? SAYS MENDELOWITZ. IT??S ALSO INCREDIBLY FILLING. USE A WHOLE-WHEAT ENGLISH MUFFIN AND MIX SOME VEGETABLES (SUCH AS SPINACH KALE OR BROCCOLI) IN WITH THE EGGS TO BOLSTER THE HEALTH BENEFITS EVEN FURTHER. 2. OATMEAL WHETHER YOU??RE GOING ALL OUT WITH OVERNIGHT OATS OR RELY ON A MICROWAVE PACK TO GET YOUR FIX OATMEAL IS A SOLID CHOICE. ??[THIS IS A] GREAT OPTION BECAUSE OATMEAL IS A GREAT SOURCE OF FIBER AND IS A WHOLE GRAIN? SAYS MENDELOWITZ. THAT MEANS A BOWL OF OATMEAL WILL PROVIDE A STABLE SOURCE OF ENERGY THAT KEEPS YOU FULL UNTIL LUNCH. YOU CAN MAKE THIS BREAKFAST EVEN HEALTHIER BY GETTING CREATIVE WITH YOUR TOPPINGS SAYS MENDELOWITZ. INCREASE THE MEAL??S FIBER CONTENT BY MIXING IN FRESH FROZEN OR DRIED FRUIT AND/OR NUTS AND SEEDS SUCH AS FLAX CHIA AND ALMONDS. IF YOU??RE LOOKING TO UP YOUR PROTEIN INTAKE TRY ADDING A SCOOP OF PROTEIN POWDER OR SOME GREEK YOGURT TO THE DISH. 3. YOGURT READ YOUR NUTRITION LABELS WHEN IT COMES TO CHOOSING YOGURT. WHILE IT??S HIGH IN PROTEIN YOU??LL NEED TO FIND A LOW-SUGAR (READ: UNSWEETENED) BRAND TO MAKE THIS A SOLID BREAKFAST CHOICE. MENDELOWITZ RECOMMENDS CHOOSING GREEK YOGURT (HERE??S HOW TO MAKE YOUR OWN!) WHICH IS PARTICULARLY HIGH IN PROTEIN AND PAIRING IT WITH A FEW ADD-INS IN ORDER TO PREPARE A BREAKFAST THAT KEEPS YOU FUELED ALL MORNING. MIXING IN GROUND FLAX SEED CHIA SEEDS FRUIT OR WHOLE GRAIN CEREAL WILL ADD MORE FILLING FIBER TO THE MEAL. 4. SCRAMBLED EGGS BUST OUT YOUR SKILLET: EGGS ARE HIGH IN PROTEIN ANTIOXIDANTS AND VITAMIN D WHICH MAKES THEM A HEALTHY AND FILLING CHOICE FOR ANY MEAL. ??GO BEYOND THE BASIC SCRAMBLED EGG AND GET CREATIVE IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE NUTRITIONAL VALUE OF THIS BREAKFAST OPTION? SAYS MENDELOWITZ. ??ENJOY THEM WITH A WHOLE-GRAIN ENGLISH MUFFIN [FOR A] FILLING BREAKFAST FULL OF FIBER? SHE SAYS. PLUS IF YOU??RE CUTTING BACK ON CARBS THIS IS A MORNING MEAL THAT WILL STILL KEEP YOU FULL. AND YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO HOP ABOARD THE EGG MUFFIN TREND. 5. CEREAL CEREAL COULD RANK A LITTLE HIGHER ON THIS LIST ?? OR IT COULD RANK MUCH LOWER (AHEM CAP??N CRUNCH). ??IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHICH CEREAL YOU CHOOSE? SAYS MENDELOWITZ. ??WHEN SELECTING A CEREAL MAKE SURE TO READ THE LIST OF INGREDIENTS. YOU WANT TO FIND A PRODUCT THAT HAS WHOLE GRAINS LISTED AS THE FIRST INGREDIENT. YOU MIGHT ALSO WANT TO AVOID ANY ADDED SUGAR IN THE LIST OF INGREDIENTS. INCREASE THE FIBER [CONTENT] OF YOUR CEREAL BY SPRINKLING IT WITH GROUND FLAX SEED HEMP SEED CHIA SEED OR DRIED FRUIT.? 6. TOAST SKIP THE BAGELS AND OPT FOR A SLICE OF WHOLE GRAIN BREAD INSTEAD MENDELOWITZ SAYS. PAIR IT WITH A PROTEIN AND SOME HEALTHY FAT (THINK MASHED AVOCADO SMOKED SALMON CREAM CHEESE OR HUMMUS). ??AND DON??T FORGET THE VEGGIES? SAYS MENDELOWITZ. ??A GREAT COMBINATION IS SMOKED SALMON CUCUMBER AND RED ONION ?? YUM!? 7. BACON GREAT NEWS MEAT LOVERS: YOUR CAN EAT BACON WITHOUT FEARING FOR YOUR HEALTH MENDELOWITZ SAYS. (ALTHOUGH IT??S STILL IMPORTANT TO PRACTICE MODERATION.) IT??S ALSO A GOOD IDEA TO PAIR BACON WITH SOMETHING FIBROUS. ??BY ITSELF BACON PROVIDES FAT AND PROTEIN? SAYS MENDELOWITZ. ??BUT WHERE IS THE FIBER? ENJOY YOUR BACON WITH WHOLE-GRAIN BREAD SCRAMBLED EGGS PREPARED WITH VEGETABLES AND A CUP OF FRESH FRUIT.? THAT WILL MAKE FOR A TRULY BALANCED BREAKFAST. 8. FRESH FRUIT ??FRESH FRUIT [MAKES FOR A] WONDERFUL SNACK BUT ON ITS OWN IT ISN??T CONSIDERED A MEAL? SAYS MENDELOWITZ. WHILE FRUITS DO CONTAIN HEALTHY FIBER THEY ALSO CONTAIN FAIRLY HIGH AMOUNTS OF SUGAR AND THEY DON??T PROVIDE MUCH PROTEIN. FOR THAT REASON MENDELOWITZ RECOMMENDS PAIRING FRESH FRUIT WITH SOME LEAN PROTEIN WHOLE GRAINS AND VEGETABLES IN ORDER TO MAKE A MORE FILLING AND WELL-ROUNDED BREAKFAST. 9. PANCAKES OR WAFFLES THEY MAY BE ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR FOODS AROUND BUT SADLY PANCAKES AND WAFFLES GENERALLY AREN??T ALL THAT HEALTHY. THAT??S BECAUSE ??THEY??RE MOSTLY SIMPLE CARBOHYDRATES? SAYS MENDELOWITZ ?? MEANING YOU??RE LIKELY TO FEEL HUNGRY AGAIN NOT LONG AFTER EATING A MEAL. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THERE ARE A FEW THINGS YOU CAN DO TO MAKE PANCAKES AND WAFFLES A HEALTHIER CHOICE: CHOOSE WHOLE-WHEAT FLOURS ADD BANANAS CINNAMON AND/OR PROTEIN POWDER TO THE BATTER AND TOP WITH FRESH FRUIT INSTEAD OF SUGARY SYRUP. 10. DONUT OR PASTRY BACK AWAY FROM THAT CROISSANT. ??THE REASON [THESE ITEMS ARE] LEAST NUTRITIOUS IS BECAUSE [THEY??RE] BASICALLY ALL SIMPLE CARBOHYDRATES? SAYS MENDELOWITZ. ??ALTHOUGH THE CALORIE CONTENT IS APPROPRIATE FOR BREAKFAST IF YOU EAT ONLY ONE [DONUTS AND PASTRIES] OFFER VIRTUALLY ZERO FIBER OR PROTEIN SO THEY WON??T KEEP YOU GOING THROUGHOUT YOUR MORNING.? ,33502.0

PROSECUTORS IN CAMDEN NEW JERSEY SAY A PART-TIME FATHER PARANOID OF LOSING HIS GIRLFRIEND TO A SNAPCHAT SUITOR MURDERED HIS 3 YEAR-OLD-SON TO QUELL HER ??HATEFUL DISCONTENT? OF THE CHILD. DAVID \DJ\"" CREATO JR. REPORTED HIS SON BRENDAN MISSING AT 6 A.M. ON OCTOBER 13. \""I JUST WOKE UP AND MY SON WAS GONE\"" HE TOLD A 911 OPERATOR. THREE HOURS LATER A PORT AUTHORITY K-9 UNIT FOUND BRENDAN PARTIALLY SUBMERGED IN SECLUDED WOODS LESS THAN A MILE FROM HIS FATHER??S HOME. BRENDAN??S SOCKS WERE STILL CLEAN. THE MEDICAL EXAMINER DETERMINED HE DIED FROM \""HOMICIDAL VIOLENCE OF UNDETERMINED ETIOLOGY.\"" BRENDAN??S FATHER WAS ARRESTED LAST WEEK AND INDICTED FOR FIRST-DEGREE MURDER AND SECOND-DEGREE CHILD ENDANGERMENT IN CAMDEN COUNTY NEW JERSEY. AT A BOND HEARING LAST TUESDAY ASSISTANT PROSECUTOR CHRISTINE SHAH LAID OUT THEIR CASE AGAINST CREATO INCLUDING A MOTIVE DRIVEN BY JEALOUSY AND PARANOIA. CREATO MET JULIA SPENSKY 17 ON TINDER LAST JUNE.?Ÿ WHILE PROSECUTORS SAY SPENKSY WARNED CREATO ON THEIR SECOND DATE THAT SHE DISLIKED KIDS THE PAIR CARRIED ON AN ??INTENSE ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP? THROUGH THE SUMMER. THE RELATIONSHIP COOLED OFF IN SEPTEMBER WHEN SPENKSY LEFT PENNSYLVANIA TO ATTEND COLLEGE IN NEW YORK. THAT LEFT ONLY THE WEEKENDS FOR HER TO SPEND TIME WITH CREATO WHO ALSO SAW HIS SON EVERY OTHER WEEKEND AS PART OF HIS JOINT-CUSTODY AGREEMENT WITH BRENDAN??S MOTHER. THE PROSECUTOR TOLD A JUDGE LAST WEEK THAT CREATO DROPPED SPENSKY OFF AT THE TRAIN STATION ON OCT. 12 SO SHE COULD RETURN TO NEW YORK AFTER THE LONG WEEKEND TOGETHER AT HIS APARTMENT. ONCE HOME CREATO SPOKE TO SPENSKY ON THE PHONE AT 8:15 P.M. FOR ABOUT FOUR MINUTES SHE TOLD HIM SHE WAS GOING TO BED EARLY BECAUSE SHE HAD A TEST THE NEXT MORNING AND THEY SAID GOODNIGHT. CREATO WOULD LATER TELL INVESTIGATORS HE DID NOT BELIEVE HIS GIRLFRIEND HAD GONE TO BED SO EARLY. WHILE HE WAITED FOR HIS MOTHER AND SISTER TO DROP HIS SON OFF AT 8:30 P.M. HE TEXTED SPENSKY SEVERAL TIMES SENDING WHAT SHAH CALLED ??KIND MESSAGES TELLING HER HE LOVED HER TELLING HER SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL.? SHAH SAID THAT SPENSKY DID NOT REPLY. AT 8:50 P.M. BRENDAN WAS DROPPED OFF AT CREATO??S HOME. AFTER READING TO BRENDAN AND EATING POTATO CHIPS CREATO SAID HE PUT HIM TO BED IN A LOVESEAT AT 9:30 P.M. NINE FEET FROM HIS OWN BED AND WENT TO SLEEP 30 MINUTES LATER. ??THAT WAS HIS STORY? SHAH TOLD A JUDGE. ??THE FORENSIC EXAMINATION OF HIS CELL PHONE HOWEVER TELLS A MUCH DIFFERENT STORY.? PROSECUTORS SAY PHONE RECORDS SHOW CREATO WAS AWAKE AND ONLINE HOURS LATER THAN HE CLAIMED ON THE MORNING BRENDAN DIED OBSESSED WITH WHAT HE IMAGINED HIS ABSENT GIRLFRIEND MAY BE DOING ?? AND WHO SHE WAS DOING IT WITH. FROM THE MOMENT HE WAS ALONE WITH HIS SON ACCORDING TO PHONE RECORDS DETAILED BY SHAH CREATO WAS ONLINE SNOOPING THROUGH SPENSKY??S SOCIAL MEDIA PROFILES FOR EVIDENCE OF INFIDELITY. CREATO TOLD POLICE ON THE DAY OF THE DISAPPEARANCE THAT ??HE WAS SUSPICIOUS OF HIS GIRLFRIEND BECAUSE SHE WAS GOING TO BED SO EARLY HE DIDN??T BELIEVE HER? ACCORDING TO SHAH. ??HE WAS HAVING A LOT OF ANXIETY ABOUT HER TALKING TO ??[A] GUY. HE DESCRIBED HIS OWN STATE OF MIND THAT MONDAY NIGHT AS JEALOUS AND PARANOID.? WHEN SPENSKY DID NOT REPLY TO HIS TEXTS AND WITH HIS MOTHER AND SISTER GONE SHAH SAYS CREATO USED HIS CELL PHONE ??TO GET INTO ONE OF HER SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS? INCLUDING SNAPCHAT. ??HE SAW THAT SHE RECEIVED A MESSAGE OR SNAP I BELIEVE IT??S CALLED FROM A GUY AT SCHOOL ?? THE SAME GUY HE WAS ALREADY JEALOUS OF AND ALREADY WORRIED ABOUT? SHAH SAID. SHAH SAID CREATO TRIED TO CALL HIS GIRLFRIEND THREE MORE TIMES BETWEEN 9:54 AND 10:07 P.M.

IN HER ONLY PUBLIC APPEARANCE SINCE HER 2013 DIVORCE FROM RUSSIA??S PRESIDENT LYUDMILA APPEARED AT A LITERARY AWARDS CEREMONY PUT ON BY A PUBLISHING HOUSE RUN BY OCHERETNYI??S GROUP. LYUDMILA AND VLADIMIR PUTIN WERE MARRIED IN 1983 AND LIVED IN EAST GERMANY WITH THEIR TWO DAUGHTERS BEFORE MOVING LENINGRAD NOW KNOWN AS ST. PETERSBURG. IN 1995 THE PUTINS GOT AN APARTMENT IN ST. PETERSBURG WHILE HE WAS DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF THE CITY GOVERNMENT. IT WAS ORIGINALLY REGISTERED TO THEM AND THEIR DAUGHTERS. SOBESEDNIK FOUND THAT THE APARTMENT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY TRANSFERRED TO THE PRESIDENT??S MOTHER-IN-LAW AND THEN LYUDMILA??S SISTER. THEN ON SEPTEMBER 24 THE APARTMENT WAS EVIDENTLY SOLD TO SOMEONE NAMED LYUDMILA ALEKSANDROVNA OCHERETNAYA??WITH THE SAME PATRONYMIC BIRTHDATE AND PLACE OF BIRTH AS RUSSIA??S FORMER FIRST LADY.

THE MERE MENTION OF HIS NAME TURNS HIS SMILE INTO A SCOWL. ??YOU REALLY DON??T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN? SAYS DEVITO. ??YOU WANT TO HAVE HUMAN RIGHTS AND EQUALITY FOR EVERYONE.

STARTING SATURDAY YOU??LL ASK AND MAYBE GET SOME SASS. ??OH SESAME STREET EH? FANCY.? OR IF THEY??RE AMONG THOSE WITHOUT A SUBSCRIPTION TO HBO THEY MIGHT ASK FOR SOME CASH BEFORE GIVING YOU THE DIRECTIONS. YES STARTING SATURDAY MORNING SESAME STREET IS CHANGING ADDRESSES SO TO SPEAK. THE FIRST EPISODES OF THE SHOW??S 46TH SEASON WILL DEBUT FOR THE FIRST TIME ON HBO THE PAY CABLE NETWORK MORE FAMOUS FOR CHOPPING OFF HEADS AND SHOWING BOOBIES THAN IT IS FOR MOLDING YOUNG MINDS BEFORE AIRING ON ITS FORMER HOME PBS NINE MONTHS LATER. THE CHANGE??AS ALL CHANGES DO??ANGERED SOME. SESAME STREET IS AN INSTITUTION GENERATIONS OF PEOPLE HOLD NEAR AND DEAR AND ITS FOUNDING MISSION BACK IN 1969 WAS TO ENTERTAININGLY EDUCATE THE UNDERPRIVILEGED HENCE ITS OUTER-BOROUGH AESTHETIC. RELOCATING FROM PBS A NETWORK MADE POSSIBLE AS ANYONE WHO WATCHES CAN RECITE IN UNISON ??BY VIEWERS LIKE YOU? TO HBO A SUBSCRIPTION NETWORK WITH ONE OF THE MOST AFFLUENT DEMOGRAPHICS IN THE INDUSTRY SEEMS BLASPHEMOUS TO THOSE WHO GREW UP ON THE STREET. BECAUSE THE NEW HBO VERSION DOES HAVE SOME CHANGES. THE DAYS ARE SUNNIER. THE AIR IS SWEETER. THE CLOUDS ARE MUCH FURTHER AWAY. THE SPRAWLING CAST OF CHARACTERS HAS BEEN STREAMLINED. (SO MUCH ELMO.) THOSE FAMILIAR BROWNSTONES ARE SPIFFIER. THERE??S A COMPOST BIN IN THE COMMUNITY GARDEN FOR OSCAR TO POP IN AND OUT OF AND THERE??S A SIGN ADVERTISING FREE WIFI NEXT TO BIG BIRD??S NEW BIRD NEST. SURE SESAME STREET HAS BEEN GENTRIFIED BUT IT HASN??T LOST ITS CHARMS. HOW YOU GET TO SESAME STREET MIGHT BE DIFFERENT BUT THE DESTINATION? AS FAMILIAR AS EVER. HBO??S PARTNERSHIP WITH SESAME STREET SPROUTS FROM MUCH NOBLER BEGINNINGS THAN ANYONE PUT OFF BY ITS SWANKY NEW ADDRESS MIGHT ADMIT. FOR YEARS PBS AND SESAME WORKSHOP HAD BEEN FACING A HARSH TRUTH: THEIR AGING CULTURAL TOUCHSTONE WHILE MAYBE NOT AS POPULAR AS IT ONCE WAS WAS CERTAINLY NOT AS DOMINANT IN THE CHILDREN??S TELEVISION SPACE. IT WAS AN EXPENSIVE SHOW. AND IT WAS LOSING MONEY. COMPETITION FROM NICKELODEON AND THE DISNEY CHANNEL HAD BEEN A THREAT TO ITS STAKE IN THE GENRE FOR DECADES BUT WITH MORE NETWORKS POPPING UP STREAMING SERVICES LIKE AMAZON AND NETFLIX INVESTING HEAVILY IN CHILDREN??S CONTENT AND A SIMPLE YOUTUBE SEARCH SUFFICING TO FIND ENGAGING CONTENT FOR YOUR KID TOO MUCH TRAFFIC HAD BEGUN DETERRING TRIPS TO SESAME STREET. THE DAYS OF TICKLE ME ELMO WERE ALSO LONG GONE. REVENUE FOR LICENSING HAD BEEN PLUMMETING AS HAD DVD AND TOY SALES. SENTIMENTALITY ON BEHALF OF PARENTS WAS ONE THING. KIDS ACTUALLY WATCHING WAS ANOTHER. ?Ÿ MAKING THE SHOW ISN??T CHEAP. EVEN ON SESAME STREET THE RENT IS TOO DAMN HIGH SOMETHING THAT MITT ROMNEY INFAMOUSLY REMINDED US FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN HE MADE EVICTING BIG BIRD PART OF HIS CAMPAIGN PLATFORM. ??I??M SORRY JIM I??M GONNA STOP THE SUBSIDY TO PBS? HE TOLD DEBATE MODERATOR JIM LEHRER WHO IS EXECUTIVE EDITOR FOR PBS NEWSHOUR. ??I LIKE PBS. I LOVE BIG BIRD. I ACTUALLY LIKE YOU TOO. BUT I??M NOT GONNA KEEP ON SPENDING MONEY ON THINGS TO BORROW MONEY FROM CHINA TO PAY FOR IT.? ENTER HBO. THROUGH ITS PARTNERSHIP HBO INCREASED THE NUMBER OF EPISODES FROM 18 TO 35 EACH YEAR WHILE ALLEVIATING THE FINANCIAL BURDEN ON SESAME WORKSHOP THE NON-PROFIT GROUP THAT PRODUCES THE SHOW. OF COURSE THAT CAME WITH SOME STIPULATIONS. ON THE NEW SESAME STREET ONLY THE MUPPETS THAT TEST THE BEST??BIG BIRD COOKIE MONSTER ABBY CADABBY ROSITA ELMO GROVER AND OSCAR??WILL FEATURE PROMINENTLY IN MAIN STORYLINES. THE SET GOT A FACE LIFT WITH EXECS DISMAYED BY THE GRITTINESS. THOSE POP CULTURE PARODIES OF SHOWS LIKE GAME OF THRONES AND MAD MEN THAT HIP CULTURE WEBSITES LOVE SO MUCH WILL BE SPARSER IN LINE WITH A MISSION TO MAKE THE SHOW MORE FOCUSED ON KIDS AND NOT THEIR PARENTS. (NOT MANY FOUR-YEAR-OLDS WERE IN ON THE JOKE OF FRANK UNDERWOLF IN HOUSE OF BRICKS.) THE BIGGEST CHANGE THOUGH IS THE REDUCTION OF EACH EPISODE FROM AN HOUR TO 30 MINUTES A MORE DIGESTIBLE TIME FOR KIDS IN TODAY??S EVER-DISTRACTED WORLD. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? IT??S A GOOD CALL! IN FACT SATURDAY??S FIRST TWO EPISODES IN THIS FIVE-YEAR HBO DEAL ARE PRETTY GREAT. WHEN WE RE-MEET THE CHARACTERS ABBY IS HAVING A SLEEPOVER AT ELMO??S. A NEW BILINGUAL HUMAN CHARACTER NINA (PLAYED BY SUKI LOPEZ) IS INTRODUCED. SHE WORKS AT THE LAUNDROMAT THE BIKE SHOP AND BABYSITS. GOTTA WORK THREE JOBS TO AFFORD THAT HBO BILL! NINA EDUCATES ELMO AND ABBY ABOUT BEDTIME ROUTINES. IT??S CUTE. IT??S INFORMATIVE. IT WILL THRILL PARENTS??DON??T BE LOUD OR ROUGH-HOUSE RIGHT BEFORE BED IS THE DRIVING POINT OF THE EPISODE. LATER ELMO DOES A SONG AND DANCE TO INTRODUCE THE LETTER OF THE DAY. IT??S CATCHY. YOU WILL BE SINGING ABOUT THE LETTER ??B? FOR THE NEXT SIX WEEKS. DESPITE TELLING THE PRESS THAT CELEBRITY CAMEOS ARE GOING TO BE FEWER AND FARTHER BETWEEN IN THIS REFOCUSED SESAME STREET BOTH SATURDAY??S EPISODES FEATURE FAMOUS GUEST STARS??AND ARE BETTER FOR IT. TRACEE ELLIS ROSS TEACHES US ALL ABOUT ALLITERATION WHILE IN BED WITH HER STUFFED BEAGLE A BURROWING BEAR A BANANA A BOUNCING BALL AND OF COURSE BIG BIRD. LIKE ANYTHING FEATURING TRACEE ELLIS ROSS THE SCENE IS EFFORTLESSLY RESPLENDENT. THE SECOND EPISODE FEATURES A PROMINENT GUEST ARC FROM ALAN CUMMING WHO IS HILARIOUS AS MUCKO POLO THE GREATEST GROUCH EXPLORER IN THE WORLD. ??I SEARCH FOR GROUCHINESS WHERE NO ONE HAS FOUND IT BEFORE AND I FIND IT TOO? HE EXPLAINS TO ELMO AND OSCAR THE GROUCH. ??YOU??RE NOT GOING TO FIND IT ON SESAME STREET? OSCAR SAYS IN RETURN. THE EXCHANGE KICKS OFF A CHARMING BIT ABOUT USING YOUR FIVE SENSES TO DISCOVER THINGS (IN THIS CASE THINGS THAT ARE DISGUSTING AWFUL STINKY SLIMY OR YUCKY) BUT COULD ALSO BE SEEN AS A KNOWING ACKNOWLEDGEMENT??AND PERHAPS KISS-OFF??TO ALL THE BEHIND-THE-SCENES GROUCHINESS THAT HAS FOLLOWED SESAME STREET??S HBO MOVE. A SHOW AS HALLOWED AND AS MUCH A PART OF OUR LIVES AS SESAME STREET??FOR SO MANY PEOPLE BIG BIRD AND ELMO WERE NOT JUST FUN FRIENDS TO VISIT BUT SURROGATE PARENTS THE COUNT A TEACHER??FOSTERS STRONG PASSIONS. AND NOT JUST FOR VIEWERS BUT FOR THE CREATIVES WHO HAVE BEEN SWEEPING THE CLOUDS AWAY FOR ALL THESE YEARS. CHIEF AMONG THEM IS JOEY MAZZARINO SESAME STREET??S FORMER HEAD WRITER WHO PARTED WAYS WITH THE SHOW IN SEPTEMBER OVER THE HBO MOVE. ??AFTER ALMOST A YEAR OF BATTLING FOR WHAT I BELIEVE IS THE HEART AND SOUL OF THE SHOW I LOST THE WAR? HE WROTE ON FACEBOOK. WHILE NOT TANTAMOUNT TO BIG BIRD FLYING THE COOP IT??S AN INDICATION THAT NOT EVERYTHING WAS SUNNY ON THE STREET AFTER THE HBO BAILOUT. FOR A SENSE OF WHAT WAS IRKING THESE PEOPLE WHO HAD GROWN ACCUSTOMED TO CREATIVE FREEDOM AND AN ENDLESS BUDGET?ŸNEW YORK MAGAZINE GIVES JUICY??AND HILARIOUS??DETAILS ABOUT WHAT JEFFREY DUNN THE FORMER CEO OF NICKELODEON WHO WAS HIRED BY SESAME IN 2014 TO REORGANIZE OPERATIONS AND CUT COSTS WORE TO THE ANNUAL HALLOWEEN PARTY. HE DRESSED AS THE COUNT. IT??S EASY TO UNDERSTAND WHY MAZZARINO THE SHOW??S CREATIVES OR EVEN BIG BIRD MIGHT FIND THEIR FEATHERS RUFFLED OVER THIS MOVE. VIEWERS TOO. HBO ISN??T FREE. THE PARENTS TELEVISION COUNCIL EVEN?ŸLAUNCHED A CAMPAIGN AFTER THE ANNOUNCEMENT FOR THE NETWORK TO MAKE THE EPISODES AVAILABLE FOR FREE BOTH KEEPING IN LINE WITH THE SHOW??S HISTORY OF EDUCATING UNDERPRIVILEGED CHILDREN??THE FAMILIES THAT CAN??T AFFORD A $180/YEAR HBO SUBSCRIPTION??AND AVOIDING ANY MORAL COMPLICATIONS THAT WOULD ARISE FROM SUBSCRIBING TO A NETWORK KNOWN FOR EXPLICIT CONTENT IN ORDER TO GAIN ACCESS TO A CHILDREN??S SHOW. BUT AS FOR MAZZARINO??S INSINUATION THAT ANY HEART OR SOUL IS MISSING FROM THE SHOW WE KNOW AND LOVE I??M NOT SURE THAT??S TRUE. AND FOR WHAT IT??S WORTH I??M A TV WRITER AND AS SUCH HAVE WATCHED DOZENS OF PILOTS AND PREMIERES FOR NEW AND RETURNING WINTER SHOWS IN RECENT WEEKS. NOTHING ENTERTAINED ME MORE THAN THESE TWO EPISODES OF SESAME STREET. THE HBO MOVE AND SUBSEQUENT UPDATING MAKES SESAME STREET LIKE THE NEW CONDO THAT??S TOWERING OVER THE OLD NEIGHBORHOOD. SURE IT??S NICE IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT. BUT THE ORIGINAL BUILDINGS ARE THE ONES WITH REAL CHARACTER. PBS IS AIRING ??BEST OF? EPISODES FOR THE NEXT NINE MONTHS UNTIL THEY GET ACCESS TO HBO??S ORIGINALS.

SHOW US YOUR IDEAS.? U.S. OFFICIALS SAY THAT??S THE MESSAGE PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA HAS SENT HIS MILITARY COMMANDERS IN THE WAR AGAINST THE SO-CALLED ISLAMIC STATE. THE ADMINISTRATION IS TAKING THE GLOVES OFF AFTER MORE THAN A YEAR OF RELUCTANCE TO TARGET THE TERRORIST??S CORE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR FEAR OF HITTING CIVILIANS OR RISKING THE LIVES OF AMERICAN TROOPS. TWO RECENT STRIKES ON ISIS CASH DEPOTS ARE EXAMPLES OF IDEAS ONCE CONSIDERED TOO RISKY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOW EMBRACING AND ONE OF THOSE ATTACKS MAY HAVE DESTROYED FROM HALF A BILLION TO THREE-QUARTERS OF A BILLION DOLLARS TWO U.S. OFFICIALS SAID WEDNESDAY. FACED WITH THE VIRULENCE OF THE ISIS BRAND AND THE CLOCK TICKING DOWN ON PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA??S LAST TERM ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS ARE GREEN-LIGHTING AGGRESSIVE PROPOSALS THAT HAVE BEEN LANGUISHING FOR YEARS AND ASKING FOR MORE IDEAS TO CHECK THE GROWTH OF ISIS FROM SYRIA TO LIBYA AND BEYOND ACCORDING TO MULTIPLE U.S. DEFENSE OFFICIALS. THEY SAY THE CHANGES IN TACTICS ARE STILL ??INCREMENTAL???MILITARY COMMANDERS AND INTELLIGENCE CHIEFS ALIKE ARE LOATHE TO PUT FORWARD ANY SWEEPING PROPOSALS LIKE EXPANDING THE SINGLE NEW ELITE SPECIAL OPERATIONS AND INTELLIGENCE FUSION CELL IN NORTHERN IRAQ TO FOUR OR FIVE REGIONAL CENTERS. BUT THEY SAY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS AT LAST LEANING INTO THE FIGHT. ??YOU HAVE TO PROCEED IN A WAY THAT INCORPORATES PARTNER FEEDBACK? FROM IRAQ OR OTHER COALITION MEMBERS A SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL TOLD THE DAILY BEAST ON BACKGROUND. ANOTHER OFFICIAL WHO ALSO SPOKE ON CONDITION OF ANONYMITY SAID THE U.S. CAN??T ASK FOR PERMISSION TO DISPATCH MORE ELITE FORCES UNTIL IT PROVES THE WORTH OF THE ONES IT??S ALREADY SENT. OFFICIALS SAY THE NEW AGGRESSIVENESS IS PARTLY IN RESPONSE TO THE ISIS-DIRECTED AND INSPIRED ATTACKS IN PARIS AND SAN BERNADINO WHICH SHOWED A VIRULENCE THAT PRODUCED VIOLENCE FASTER THAN THE ADMINISTRATION EXPECTED. AT THE SAME TIME THERE IS AN EYE TO THE OBAMA LEGACY. THE PRESIDENT WHO WANTED TO BE KNOWN AS THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF WHO DECIMATED AL-QAEDA DOES NOT WANT TO GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS HAVING CEDED THE BATTLEFIELD TO AL-QAEDA??S SUCCESSOR ISIS. TOWARD THAT END SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ASH CARTER SAID IN PARIS LAST WEEK THAT EFFORTS TO HIT ISIS WOULD INTENSIFY EVEN AS HE NAGGED COALITION PARTNERS TO UP THEIR EFFORT. CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF GEN. JOSEPH DUNFORD TOLD REPORTERS THAT HE MAY RECOMMEND EMBEDDING U.S. ADVISERS WITH IRAQI UNITS AT REMOTE BASES TO HELP RECAPTURE MOSUL AND SPOKE OF A POSSIBLE MILITARY SOLUTION TO THE GROWING ISIS MOVEMENT IN LIBYA. U.S. OFFICIALS SAY THAT WHILE A SMALL BAND OF U.S. INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS AND SPECIAL OPERATORS MOVE IN AND OUT OF LIBYA TRYING TO FORGE LOCAL TIES TO FIGHT ISIS A MORE FORWARD-LEANING COALITION OF THE U.S. AND OTHER WESTERN COUNTRIES MUST WAIT FOR THE LIBYANS THEMSELVES TO AGREE ON A NEW GOVERNMENT. PREVIOUS TARGETING WITHIN IRAQ AND SYRIA HAD BEEN LIMITED MOSTLY TO IDENTIFIABLE ISIS CHECKPOINTS SAFE HOUSES IN REMOTE AREAS OR FIGHTERS ON THE MOVE WHICH MEANT WAR PLANES AND DRONES WERE EXPENDING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF ORDNANCE TO TAKE OUT A TRUCK OR A SHACK. THOSE TYPES OF STRIKES CONTINUE BUT THE SUCCESS OF A FEW RISKY CALLS HAS GIVEN THE ADMINISTRATION MORE CONFIDENCE AND GIVEN THE PENTAGON MORE ROOM TO MANEUVER. AMONG THEM: A SPECIAL OPERATIONS RAID INSIDE SYRIA LAST MAY AND ONE TO FREE ISIS PRISONERS INSIDE IRAQ IN OCTOBER AS WELL AS THE RECENT TARGETING OF THE ISIS OIL INFRASTRUCTURE AND CASH RESERVES. THE MAY 2015 RAID KILLED FINANCIER ABU SAYYAF BUT NETTED HIS WIFE AND A YAZIDI SLAVE PLUS COMPUTERS AND DOCUMENTS THAT CONTINUE TO HELP MAP THE ISIS NETWORK. THE LATER RAID TO FREE ISIS PRISONERS INSIDE IRAQ NETTED STILL MORE INTELLIGENCE. THAT CLEARED THE WAY TO A PROPOSAL TO BASE IN NORTHERN IRAQ AN ELITE SPECIAL OPERATIONS EXPEDITIONARY TASK FORCE THAT WAS DECLARED OPERATIONAL IN DECEMBER. IT HAD TAKEN SIX MONTHS FROM IDEA TO DEPLOYMENT WHICH FRUSTRATED SOME MILITARY COMMANDERS AND ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS BUT THAT??S LIGHT SPEED CONSIDERING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION??S ORIGINAL RELUCTANCE TO INCREASE U.S. TROOP NUMBERS. TARGETING ISIS??S OIL NETWORK HAS ALSO LED TO A SUDDEN CASH CRUNCH THAT HAS FORCED ISIS TO HALVE SALARIES DRIVING SOME FOREIGN FIGHTERS TO LEAVE ACCORDING TO A SENIOR INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL. NOW MULTIPLE OFFICIALS SAY THE WHITE HOUSE IS ENCOURAGING MILITARY PLANNERS TO WIDEN THE STRIKE ZONE EVEN IF IT MEANS CATCHING CIVILIANS IN THE CROSSFIRE AND RISKING AMERICAN TROOPS?? LIVES. ??OUR HANDS HAVE BEEN TIED? SAID ONE SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIAL. ??NOW I THINK YOU??LL SEE A LITTLE MORE WILLINGNESS TO TOLERATE CIVILIAN CASUALTIES IN THE INTEREST OF MAKING PROGRESS.? THEY??RE ALSO MORE WILLING TO RISK SENDING U.S. SPECIAL OPERATIONS TEAMS INTO SYRIA TO CAPTURE MORE ISIS LEADERS ALIVE FOR QUESTIONING BY KURDISH AND IRAQI FORCES BOTH TO GATHER MORE INTELLIGENCE AND TO MAKE THE ISIS LEADERSHIP WONDER WHAT THEIR CAPTIVE COMRADES ARE SHARING. ANOTHER KEY MOVING THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE INTO FIGHT MODE HAS BEEN THE COMMUNICATIONS BRIDGE BUILT BY DEFENSE SECRETARY CARTER BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION THE PENTAGON AND CENTRAL COMMAND. CARTER MAY NOT HAVE BEEN THE ADMINISTRATION??S FIRST CHOICE AND HE GETS SOME KNOCKS WITHIN THE PENTAGON FOR KEEPING POLICYMAKING TO A VERY SMALL GROUP OF HIS CLOSEST ADVISERS BUT MILITARY AND INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS SAY HE HAS BRIDGED THE TRUST-AND-COMPREHENSION GAP BETWEEN THE WHITE HOUSE THE PENTAGON AND CENTRAL COMMAND. ??CARTER PLAYS A MORE ACTIVE ROLE THAN HIS PREDECESSOR. HE??S MADE HIMSELF QUITE PROMINENT IN THE ISIS FIGHT? SAID ONE SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIAL. ??HE??S A DETAIL GUY.?Ÿ IT??S BEEN WELL RECEIVED. THERE??S MORE CLARITY BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND THE OUTSTATIONS.? THE RECENT STRIKES AGAINST ISIS CASH DEPOTS ARE EMBLEMATIC. BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR CIVILIAN CASUALTIES CENTRAL COMMAND?ŸSENT THE THREE POSSIBLE CASH DEPOT TARGETS TO CARTER FOR SIGN OFF. HE SENT REQUESTS FOR MORE INFORMATION AND EVENTUALLY OKAYED TWO OF THE STRIKES ONE ON JAN. 11TH AND THE SECOND LAST WEEK TWO U.S. OFFICIALS SAID. ONE OF THE TWO STRIKES HIT THE EL RAFIDAYN BANK IN MOSUL AND DESTROYED UP TO THREE-QUARTERS OF A BILLION DOLLARS PLUS AN ESTIMATED COUPLE HUNDRED POUNDS OF GOLD SAID THE OFFICIAL SPEAKING ON CONDITION OF ANONYMITY. THE OFFICIALS WOULD NOT SHARE THE CURRENCY NOR HOW MILITARY OFFICIALS CAME UP WITH THE ESTIMATE BUT ACKNOWLEDGED THAT U.S. INTELLIGENCE HAD BEEN STUDYING ISIS??S COMMUNICATIONS AFTER THE STRIKES. THE THIRD TARGET REMAINS UNTOUCHED BUT ISIS FIGHTER MORALE HAS PLUMMETED AND FOREIGN FIGHTERS ARE DESERTING BECAUSE SALARIES HAVE BEEN HALVED ACCORDING TO THE TWO U.S. OFFICIALS AND A SECOND SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL. ISIS HAS SINCE MOVED MUCH OF THE REMAINING CASH TO A HOSPITAL IN MOSUL THE OFFICIALS SAID. CARTER HINTED AT MORE AGGRESSIVE MOVES TO COME FROM THE SPECIAL OPERATIONS EXPEDITIONARY TARGETING FORCE OR ETF IN COMMENTS TO REPORTERS AS HE TRAVELED TO PARIS TO ASK COALITION PARTNERS TO STEP UP THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS. ??AN ETF-LIKE RAID??THE ONE THAT TOOK DOWN ABU SAYYAF AND ALSO THE ONE THAT FREED 70 PRISONERS??THEY WERE BOTH LEARNING EXPERIENCES FOR US? HE SAID.?Ÿ ??THE MORE YOU??RE ON THE GROUND THE MORE YOU LEARN AND THEREFORE THE MORE OPPORTUNITY YOU HAVE.? THAT??S THE KIND OF RAID THAT THE MAN NOMINATED TO LEAD THE ISIS FIGHT KNOWS WELL. GEN. JOSEPH VOTEL ONCE LED THE JOINT SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND WHICH RUNS THE ETF RESPONSIBLE FOR COUNTERTERRORIST RAIDS LIKE THE ONES THAT KILLED OSAMA BIN LADEN IN 2011 AND ABU MUSAB AL ZARQAWI THE LEADER OF THE ISIS PRECURSOR AL-QAEDA IN IRAQ IN 2006. IN COMMENTS TO THE DAILY BEAST VOTEL HINTED AT A SWEEPING OPEN-ENDED FIGHT IN IRAQ SYRIA AND BEYOND. ??IT??S MORE THAN TAKING THEIR TERRITORY. IT??S PREVENTING THEIR ABILITY TO GOVERN NULLIFYING THEIR MESSAGE TAKING AWAY THEIR RESOURCES CUTTING OFF THEIR FOREIGN FIGHTERS? VOTEL SAID. ??I DON??T THINK YOU COULD PUT A TIME LIMIT ON IT? HE ADDED. ??I CERTAINLY WOULDN??T.? HE EARLIER TOLD AN AUDIENCE OF CURRENT AND FORMER SPECIAL OPERATIONS OFFICIALS THAT HE PLANNED TO GET AHEAD OF ISIS BY BEATING THEM TO THE COUNTRIES RIPE FOR A MILITANT-LED UPRISING. ??I SEE OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO ENGAGE IN THE AREAS WHERE ISIS IS NOT ESTABLISHED YET WHERE THEY DON??T CONTROL TERRAIN DIRECTLY BUT WHERE THERE ARE DISAFFECTED POPULATIONS WHERE WE CAN BEGIN TO GET IN AND WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS? VOTEL SAID AT THE NATIONAL DEFENSE INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION??S SPECIAL OPERATIONS AND LOW INTENSITY CONFLICT ANNUAL MEETING IN WASHINGTON. SPECIAL OPERATIONS TROOPS HAVE ALREADY BEEN WORKING IN SMALL NUMBERS IN PLACES LIKE SOMALIA MALI AND OTHER REMOTE PARTS OF AFRICA??A VANGUARD EFFORT THAT COULD BE EXPANDED. ANOTHER TOP SPECIAL OPERATIONS OFFICIAL SPEAKING AT THE CONFERENCE MICHAEL LUMPKIN HAS BEEN TAPPED TO RUN THE STATE DEPARTMENT??S INFORMATION WAR AGAINST EXTREMIST GROUPS INCLUDING ISIS. FORMER NAVY SEAL LUMPKIN WAS BLUNT IN HIS CRITIQUE OF ADMINISTRATION EFFORTS TO COUNTER ISIS??S MESSAGE SO FAR SAYING IT ??QUITE FRANKLY NEEDS BETTER DIRECTION AND MORE RESOURCES.? HE SAID SPECIAL OPERATIONS?? BRAND OF ??SPEED AND AGILITY? WOULD HELP FIND TECHNOLOGIES TO MEASURE THE IMPACT OF BOTH ISIS??S MESSAGE AND THE SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT PUMPED OUT TO COUNTER IT. IT WAS A BLUNT JAB AT THE EXISTING CAMPAIGN WHICH HAS PRODUCED LITTLE CONTENT TO COMBAT ISIS??S 200000-PLUS DAILY POSTINGS??AND THE CONTENT IT HAS PRODUCED HAS BEEN WIDELY PANNED. ??THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS NOT ALWAYS THE MOST EFFECTIVE MESSENGER TO CONTEST THIS PROPAGANDA? HE SAID. ??THE MOST CREDIBLE VOICES COME FROM ACROSS THE REGION AND WITHIN VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES.? WHILE THE NOMINATIONS OF VOTEL AND LUMPKIN SEEM TO GO ALONG WITH A MORE AGGRESSIVE WHITE HOUSE CAMPAIGN OVERALL THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS IN IRAQ AND SYRIA IS STILL NOT GOING FAST ENOUGH FOR SOME OFFICIALS. THEY COMPLAIN THAT CAPPING THE U.S. TROOPS TO LESS THAN 4000 IN IRAQ AND RELYING ON OTHER COALITION PARTNERS FOR OTHER TASKS TO KEEP U.S. NUMBERS DOWN CREATES AN UNWIELDY PATCHWORK OF TRAINING AND LOGISTICS. ??WE??RE SLOWLY COOKING THE FROG INSTEAD OF TURNING THE HEAT UP AND BOILING IT ALIVE? ONE SENIOR U.S. OFFICIAL SAID.
