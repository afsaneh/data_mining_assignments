technology and changing more have conspired to lower barrier of entry'and acceptability gatekeeper no longer exist what we have right now is closer to direct democracy than we 've ever seen and our civilization is regressing a a result one party the democrat already represents the liberal half of the nation the other half seems to consist of modern buckleyite conservative but also an increasingly large horde populist nationalist individualistic americans'who now have a megaphone and a vessel in the form of donald trump time change and political party adapt or are replaced and make no mistake if the party of lincoln becomes the party of trump it would essentially redefine what it mean to be a republican conservatism a coherent political philosophy look a if it 's being replaced by messy right wing populism just a the political party sorted themselves out so that there are no more 'conservative democrat or 'liberal republican i fear we may be entering a new stage where there are essentially two distinct political tribe one tribe consists of minority and educated elite while the other tribe increasingly consists of working class white the trend that brought u this situation have been in existence for decade but may be remembered a the year when we broke apart and political difference became primary cultural signifier disagreement about ideological principle or even policy preference seem to be taking a back seat to identity politics it doe n't matter what you believe in so much a what grouping you belong to and how willing you are to fight for the sliver of america you represent wa the year of tribalism our politics are le high minded than ever if tribe strike you a primitive it 's not just you tribe tend to assign leadership not based on experience or wisdom but based on strength much of what we are witnessing today is very base no pun intended and essentially come down to machismo the other guy are out to get u so we need our toughest guy to get them first this is the major rationale for trump supporter who see him a an 'alpha in a sea of wishy washy beltway insider conservative once hated identity politics and victimhood'but then again we once supported free trade too perhaps our disdain for tribalism wa always a high minded yet doomed effort to suppress the natural carnal state of a fallen humanity you and i may view politics a being about idea and human flourishing but a lot of people believe it 's really about power'about making sure scarce resource are allocated to 'our people although i did n't see the trump phenomenon coming i think i sensed the populist zeitgeist that led both to him and to this larger breakdown into tribe here 's something i wrote back in april for the beast'long before trump wa in the race 'i think there is a huge underserved constituency in the gop'and that constituency is what might best be termed populist conservative these folk tend to be white and working class and who feel they 've been left behind in america they are culturally conservative'but they also want to keep government out of their medicare mitt romney wa arguably the worst candidate republican could have ever nominated to appeal to this constituency but while candidate like huckabee and rick santorum flirted with going full populist something always seemed to keep them from really doubling down on it ' the last time someone really tried this wa when 'pitchfork pat buchanan and then ross perot ran in it resonated then but that wa before the 'giant sucking sound really kicked in whether it 's globalization or immigration'or whatever ' ation might have taken your job'it stand to reason that the same grassroots phenomenon that helped buchanan and perot tap into an underserved constituency might be even more potent today i still think there 's a decent chance that this fever'which ha been aided by an economic downturn obama 's election and the rise of isis'will break and i think that the rule governing the way the gop allocates delegate will probably benefit someone who is a more mainstream and thoughtful conservative like marco rubio it 's easy to see how a rubio presidency could help reorder thing in a different way'in a way that i believe would be healthier both for america and in term of making sure conservatism can survive and thrive in the st century a rubio presidency would have the potential to grow the conservative movement by modernizing not moderating it'to make it more appealing to hispanic urbanites and millennials if conservatism is about idea like freedom and entrepreneurship not merely cultural signaling the stereotype being that the definition of a conservative is a white guy with a gun rack then there 's no reason the guy who order an uber should n't be a conservative but this only work if the conservative want to actually grow their number by choosing a modernizer the last cnn orc poll i saw suggested that if you add trump 's supporter together with those of ted cruz and ben carson you were at about two third of the national gop primary voter the rejection of candidate favored by the gop establishment this past year ha been unprecedented the republican base at least right now is rallying to the candidate who embrace this new tribalism earlier i said the rule have changed and indeed they have conservative used to care about electing men and woman who have wisdom experience or expertise and will comport themselves in an appropriate or 'statesmanlike manner and who have a conservative temperament they were deeply invested in defending abstract concept like a culture of life the rule of law and religious liberty while also worrying about thing like unintentional consequence they wanted to unleash the power of a free market of product and idea to encourage human flourishing these are the hallmark of conservative philosophy consistency and a coherent worldview'something that look increasingly pas to republican voter in some case much of today 's gop base is skeptical or even hostile to these conservative value for example they believe a conservative temperament is an antiquated concept guaranteed to produce weak leader who wo n't fight and that conservatism a a temperament wa essentially designed to fail how else can you explain the near triumph of contemporary liberalism and the fact that the gop ha only won the popular vote in a presidential election once since the end of the reagan era it 's hard to summon people to their better angel when those people feel aggrieved it 's hard to advise those people to 'keep your head when all about you are losing theirs 'when there are literal beheading taking place around the globe the problem is that people like me are calling for civilized behavior and for modernization at a time when republican voter want to get medieval belonged to donald trump but the real question is this who will own matt k lewis is author of the forthcoming book too dumb to fail how the gop betrayed the reagan revolution to win election and how it can reclaim it conservative root,20968.0

highly anticipated tent pole on which warner bros and dc 's ambitious superhero hope hang zack snyder ha one eye firmly on the future that 's why the director did n't bat a lash when fanboys exploded over the seemingly major reveal of the major villain in last month 's trailer 'i know what 's in the movie so i know there 's other stuff snyder laughed checking in via phone from los angeles where he 's putting the final touch on the march release among the december trailer 's controversial revelation is a first look at long rumored baddie doomsday a brawny fleshy cgi adversary created when jesse eisenberg 's lex luthor spin some insidious science on the corpse of superman 's man of steel enemy general zod michael shannon 'if man wo n't kill god the devil will do it luthor sneer snyder admits that he and warner bros wrestled with just how much to reveal to fan with two month of pre release buzz building to strategize 'we had a long conversation about just taking ownership of that of giving it to the audience in a controlled way that i felt wa consistent with the escalation of the campaign said snyder a commercial veteran last week snyder took a brief pause to stump for the doritos crash the super bowl filmmaking contest which will award one of three finalist a cool million buck fan can vote online for the winning entry which will be broadcast during super bowl 'and land the winning filmmaker a job working with snyder in the wb dc franchise snyder sent dc fan aflutter recently while promoting the super bowl contest 'in a weird way justice league is the next step for these character to form a bigger team he teased 'maybe there 's a bigger enemy to fight did he mean darkseid brainiac ever ambiguous snyder hinted at what he may or may not have in mind for justice league 's 'bigger enemy 'well you have doomsday right he doe n't just crawl out of the ground he ha his own mythology right so that ha to be explored ' the tight lipped snyder 's not giving up much more than that for now but he doe want audience to begin thinking of dc 's superhero brand in macro term 'to u it really made sense to give doomsday to the audience now i really wanted to make the audience a promise that'though i 'm super excited and happy and fulfilled by the conflict of batman and superman there 's also a bigger world to start to think about that bigger world is of course the greater dc comic superhero universe'and warner bros ha a lot of catching up to do using 's superman origin tale man of steel a a canonical jumping off point the studio announced ten more shared universe superhero flick to weave together chasing the heel of disney and marvel 's competing avenger film franchise and a the shepherd guiding the direction of warner bros and dc 's cinematic future snyder 's the one laying down the roadmap 'it is constantly evolving but we 're starting to get a handle on where we 're going with the world he said 'that 's fun because it allows u now to be driving toward a goal that we do n't have to make up a much the rule can be the rule and the movie can exist in a closed universe'it allows u to tie thing together if there 's a movie over here doing this and we 're over here doing this now we 're all on the same page 'it allows for a coherent universe which is important he added 'i think that make the experience a little more satisfying because we know where we 're going so the misdirects can be stronger and the reveals can be bigger next up in the dc movieverse is this fall 's david ayer helmed suicide squad'set to feature a cameo by ben affleck a batman

justice league part one which snyder is currently storyboarding a he fly between los angeles and london where he 's prepping the justice league shoot and is also a producer on wonder woman now filming under director patty jenkins snyder 's long spoken of his allegiance to dc 's iconic 'transcendent superheroes 'they 're not just like the flavor of the week ant man he told the daily beast in september firing shot at the competition 'they 're actually opposite side of the same coin it 's interesting because batman 's a man and superman 's a god if you think about it in those term so their relationship is very contentious what superman see a batman 's limit batman see a superman trying to control him acting like an absolute dictator the grave tone and somber mood of his batman v superman promise to set dc 's brooding hero apart from marvel 's band of spandexed jokesters'although even the avenger are set to get serious and subtextual in may 's captain america civil war a the real world get scarier it can feel like humanity could use a supergroup of hero willing to band together despite their ideological political or philosophical difference plotting the future of justice league and beyond snyder say he and screenwriter chris terrio have put a lot of thought into the real world theme and implication of their superhero movie and what it will mean when batman superman and wonder woman are joined by the like of the flash aquaman and cyborg 'the great thing about having chris terrio a the writer of this project is it 's hard to get him not to do that it 's in his dna he said 'when we talk about it in mythological term we 're always talking about what doe it mean to the world what doe it mean mythologically to u now what is the why of all of it 'those conversation are a big part of the genesis of all of the idea he continued 'it also offer an opportunity because you have now a variety of perspective on a single issue that allows the conversation to be bolder

with a nostalgic description of the town where i went to high school full of the promise of a romantic teenage crush that would hopefully lead to a happily ever after ending but instead it repeated a story we all know too well boy like girl girl doe n't know he exists'in other word charlie brown and the elusive little red haired girl but unlike charlie brown the man in the story never muster the courage to speak to his crush a a boy and even when given a second chance a a young man fails to speak his truth he wo n't gain the courage to tell her how he feel about her until he anonymously share his story with two writer for an online magazine twenty year later since i 'm the featured object of his affection i assumed it wa only fair that i respond here 's my take on their story feel free to criticize on twitter we all want to believe in love we want the poor love sick boy to win over the popular girl in high school marry her have child and grow old with her we want to hear the story of a boy who had a crush and who wa reunited with her year later to find that she too wa in love with him that they would find themselves in a place in their life when their world magically collide and fate take it course but then there 's the side of us'and this is the attitude that hang over the piece'which want to hear that his muse his 'beautiful asian woman never felt loved did n't know her worth and became a stripper and when she see him in the club during her half naked round in search of lap dance that she is reminded of the girl she once wa realizes she is 'broken and run off never to be seen again if he had spoken to her that day on the street he may have been surprised to find out that she did n't have a lot of friend even though she wa a cheerleader that she wa n't out of his reach for conversation and friendship and maybe even love she may have accepted an offer of a date and gone out with him they may not have been compatible she would have most likely still moved away from the small town where she went to school but then he would never have to wonder for decade what if i ca n't recall who kj is but i do vaguely remember saying something to a boy working on his car while walking home from school there were also a few guy who came into the strip club where i worked year later that i had gone to school with so that part of his story could also be true but the suggestion that woman choose to strip because they are broken do n't know their worth or lack self esteem is n't entirely correct i used to be enraged when men would tell me i wa 'too pretty or 'too smart to be a stripper i remember debating with customer about my choice to be in a job where i took my clothes off for money what these men did n't know about me wa that i had already worked three job at a time to pay the bill one of which included daily sexual harassment that the management would never address i had passed the real estate exam at taken on my first business and been married at and by the age of wa relieved to finally have a job that i loved that paid me something close to the true value of my time this job actually enabled me to put myself through college though i would only complete one semester i did n't end up a a stripper i chose to be one if i did run out the back door of the club that night it may have been because i did n't want to be at work some night going into the club and going on stage were necessary for me i needed the attention and thrived on the generous albeit false adoration while i had a few admirer in school i wa n't one of the 'pretty girl guy wanted to date me but nobody really told me i wa beautiful most of my clothes came from kmart and we could n't afford designer shoe i wa grateful on the day i got to wear my cheer uniform so that i could finally be like everybody else'except i knew i wa n't like everybody else what i did n't realize wa that the very thing that made me different wa also what made me beautiful it took three month of working in a full nude bar to grow into the woman that i would become a woman who wa driven who wanted everything this life had to offer who no longer cared to fit in with everyone else but instead had a longing to be who she wa it wa there on that dark smoke filled stage that she gained the courage to be herself night after night i enjoyed the performance aspect of my work and i liked being able to be sexy to feel desired but on my term i had the chance to explore my femininity my sexuality and my persona without consequence i found myself in the pair of thigh high patent leather boot that climbed their way onto the pole and into my soul i let go of the straight a self conscious over achiever that i wa and let the angry passionate dangerous side of my personality explore my self confidence soared every night i became my alter ego but there were also night that i wa vulnerable i just needed to be home to be in solitude to be quiet and gentle with myself i 'm guessing that might have been the case the night kj came into the club we may have exchanged word about him being from hesperia i may have not wanted to make small talk that night i may have felt exhausted at the prospect of having to pull word out of this shy man 's mouth in order to eventually get a lap dance out of the encounter i may have just decided to leave work that night or i may have been getting off from an earlier shift had kj told me that he used to have a crush on me i may have stayed and talked to him it wa n't all about the money i got just a much out of being in the club a many of the men who visited i got to be the object of someone 's affection just a much a they were the object of mine it did n't matter if there wa a monetary exchange for the transaction both party were adult human being with the need to feel seen feel desired maybe even feel loved had kj understood this part of strip club culture he might have finally had the courage to spend more than just a fleeting moment with miyoko fujimori being present speaking our truth sharing our need and desire with those around u is n't always encouraged we constantly play game pretend to be people that we are n't worry about what other people think of u and ultimately live our life a a slight representation of who we really are so to kj and every other person who ha a similar story about the one who got away'why not

student meredith kercher ha spoken publicly outside a court of law for the first time giving his version of the story in a pre taped multi camera interview in the tailoring classroom of the viterbo prison in central italy guede wearing a gray sweater and glass spoke about his life and the murder for which he is now serving year the ivory coast native wa a far cry from the scruffy man the press described a a drug pusher and ex con in fact he said he had never tried hard drug and his record show that despite report to the contrary he had no previous conviction for any crime he maintained his innocence pointed the finger at seattle native amanda knox and refused to name her italian boyfriend raffaele sollecito knox and sollecito were convicted acquitted reconvicted and definitively acquitted of kercher 's murder over the course of the last eight year the interview aired on italy 's prime time maledette storie 'cursed story which chronicle the country 's most controversial story to a wide audience on thursday night guede speaking polished italian and presenting an extremely cultured if not intellectual image spoke clearly and concisely about his life including how at the age of he wa taken from his mother 's arm in the ivory coast after his father 'reclaimed him in italy image of his prison art project and the crime scene were interspersed among the long take of his candid interview but it would take a true kercher murder junkie to really separate the wheat from the chaff there are many inconsistency in his story and what he said during the interrogation that led to his conviction guede who wa arrested more than a week after the murder'after he escaped to germany and after knox fingered her congolese nightclub bos patrick lumumba'maintains his innocence guede described in blushing detail how he had met kercher a few month before her murder and how on halloween the two shared a kiss on the dance floor of a local nightclub saying it 'is n't that difficult to get a kiss on the dance floor in a college scene he brushed off report that kercher 's friend denied such a kiss with what amounted to a wink and a nod and talked about how dark a nightclub really is he stood by his original story that after that dance floor kiss kercher had invited him over the next night nov and he happily obliged arriving at her house after dark he said she opened the door for him and that they sat in her living room he drank a juice and then they engaged in 'petting but stopped short of sex because neither of them had a condom and he added because she had been in other relationship he would n't go further unprotected when franca leosini the show 's interviewer pressed him about why if he had gone there to continue the romance from the night before he had n't taken a prophylactic 'just in case he shrugged it off guede then described how kercher complained to him about her roommate knox saying she had stolen her money and how she wa a slob then feeling the effect of a spicy kebab he had eaten earlier he had excused himself to one of the bathroom in the apartment where he spent 'around or minute and listened to two and a half song before a scream 'louder than the music from my headphone startled him that scream he said came after knox whose voice he recognized'somehow despite his loud music'had come home to confront her roommate then he said he hurried to finish his business and ran out of the bathroom leaving the toilet famously un flushed a he raced out to see what happened there he saw a man he said a random man it would seem at that someone he did n't know someone foreign to him someone who after all these year he ha come to know a part of his own theory but who remained nameless he then quoted the court document that named that man a raffaele sollecito though he refused to do so himself sollecito it might be noted had spent the week prior to the airing of the highly anticipated interview threatening to sue guede if he wa named in an attempt to stop the show from being broadcast a it turn out sollecito need n't have worried since guede did n't name him but knox guede said more than once wa there 'i am percent certain amanda knox wa there he said before describing how the unnamed man warned knox that they had 'been discovered and ran out of the building but not before saying 'black man found guilty found guede said he knew knox from flirting with her at the bar where she worked and he described in detail how they found a connection when he told her he also had a friend from seattle then guede said two thing that even the most seasoned kercher murder watcher may have found surprising he admitted to going into kercher 's room after knox and the unnamed man left with fluffy towel to try to stop the flow of blood from the stab wound to kercher 's neck then he said he fled the scene out of a combination of fear and paranoia that he conveniently regret he went to germany he said but only because that wa where the next train wa going adding that he might have just a easily ended up in russia then he told leosini that when he fled kercher wa completely clothed in 'the same clothes she wa wearing when she opened the door for me but the fact beg an explanation since kercher wa found semi nude with her jean and underwear in a heap on the floor her bra'which wa covered with blood splatter implying she wa wearing it when she wa stabbed'had been cut from her body and lay in shred on the floor sollecito 's dna wa originally found on the tiny metal hook of the clasp of that bra but that evidence wa largely discounted because the cut clasp had been collected some six week after the murder took place 'she wa dressed when i left guede said undoubtedly knowing very well the accusation such a statement would imply guede also said that when he ran out of the house he left kercher 's bedroom door open which of course is not how it wa found the morning after the murder knox and sollecito were alone in the house and say kercher 's door wa locked from the inside and had to be broken down one of the few place where guede 's dna and fingerprint were not present in the murder room wa on the outside of the door which wa absent of any usable forensic evidence except the fingerprint of sollecito who said he tried in vain to open the door curious indeed guede and his interviewer said no money wa exchanged for his exclusive interview and indeed it will have no impact whatsoever on the case which is now officially closed after knox and sollecito 's case wa thrown out by italy 's high court in guede who wa convicted definitively a one of three assassin chose not to pursue a retrial after his presumed co conspirator were let go a it could have resulted in a new conviction and a longer sentence but no matter since guede will be free soon a well he ha been eligible for work release for almost two year but ha chosen to work on his study in prison instead considering he had no prior criminal conviction before his murder conviction and his apparent good behavior in prison he will most certainly be eligible for parole by the forgotten protagonist in the story a leonisi so poignantly pointed out in her interview with guede is kercher who would have turned on dec and whose version of the story which would clearly be the definitive one ha sadly gone with her to her grave,279494.0

republican see one time 'queen of porn and marco rubio supporter jenna jameson who recently said 'i certainly do not agree with the left wing political view of her former profession this leftward tilt is largely because porn honcho and performer have not forgotten about president george w bush 's 'summer of censorship or republican presidential nominee mitt romney 's vow to crack down on porn

glass shuffled into the basement meeting room of the estherville public library last friday to hear from a sander staffer about senior issue estherville is in emmet county located in deep red northwestern iowa a county that hillary clinton tied for first with john edward in the caucus you could barely find a demographic more skeptical of sander ' political revolution aside from republican of course but that 's exactly why they were all here a caucus night in iowa draw near both campaign are working hard to motivate their base but also to shore up their weakness with clinton that mean blunting sander ' advantage with young people on college campus to accomplish that clinton ha already deployed katy perry and lena dunham to iowa event and is sending singer demi lovato this week for sander the goal is to improve his standing among older iowan he trailed clinton to of likely caucus goer over in the latest de moines register poll to help with this taskhas sander ha bruce koeppl bruce enters the estherville library 's meeting room on his motorized scooter with walking cane wedged between his knee navigating his way around the table to set up at the front sporting a beard and ponytail bruce ha the look of your typical sander outsider type supporter but he 's actually an old pro at this bruce ha worked on caucus campaign since his college day serving in staffing role on ted kennedy walter mondale joe biden and paul simon 's iowa operation for the past year he 's worked for aarp on their advocacy side including a a state and regional director he retired this march but could n't stay out of the policy and political world for long joining up with the sander campaign a a senior adviser to start off the meeting bruce play a minute video of sander ' position on these issue sander himself narrates speaking directly to camera while slick graphic flash over the screen to explain social security 's solvency and other topic hi this is senator bernie sander the video begin much of the medium often approach politics a if it were a baseball game or a soap opera who 's leading in the latest poll how much money did a candidate raise did someone say something really dumb last night that 's what a lot of the medium think modern politics should be about i disagree i 'm old fashioned i guess notably sander begin and end with a call to distribute the video to friend family and neighbor this wa specifically designed scripted and shot for organizing work bruce often leaf a dozen or more extra dvd behind this iowa caucus cycle ha seen a wide mix of strategy old and new for winning the all important lead off state social medium organizing and massive rally from sander in town large and small ha many thinking his campaign ha found the key to turning out first time caucus goer to score the upset against clinton but they 're also sticking with tried and true organizing tactic like these well away from the medium spotlight to seal the deal bruce begin his discussion by asking the attendee what they spent their social security cost of living increase on this last year the room chuckle there wa no increase i do n't remember being able to buy a cup of coffee with mine one man say several around the table share their story on dealing with medicare one man 's mother had an expensive knee operation that wa covered by it another wa amazed and frustrated with how much prescription drug cost despite being cheaper in other country bruce notice a framed picture on the wall of three horse pulling farm machinery and say it reminds him of sander that he 's a workhorse he recount the many battle sander ha fought on these issue and argues that something special is happening in this campaign that could change washington some of the attendee are skeptical this is steve king country after all where local democrat have seen their candidate defeated at the federal state and local level in many of the past election cycle single payer sound nice to them but they know the reality of the shortcoming of democratic politics like few others they pepper bruce with question how can sander really get it done would n't he need a democratic congress what if he selected elizabeth warren a his vice president to hand the torch off to after some time the question are n't hostile just honest and bruce walk them through the possibility in a calm and collected manner we need a champion to take on big pharma bruce asserts softly hitting the table with his hand bernie ha n't taken their money on raising the cap for social security income it 's not a complicated fix it 's having the will to go fight for it despite the temptation to talk only political positioning the group seems to enjoy the issue discussion that 's what bernie 's got to do force the republican back to talking about the issue say dale green a year old retiree from estherville i 'm impressed because he talk about issue not personality the party used to be a lot more similar i voted for dewey my wife voted for truman it wa n't a big deal they were n't that different back then carol and jerry plouth of estherville came to the meeting undecided even though they both caucused for clinton in the plouths nodded along to many part of the sander video and seemed engaged with the discussion but they still had their doubt i thought it wa educational lot of good point i took a good long look at his stand on social security that 's a big scare for people our age carol said afterward i do n't know those top two democrat are a toss up i want the democrat to get in so bad but i do n't know if he can quite cut the mustard added jerry i think he 's got some good idea maybe if he can get people interested in voting but bruce ha found plenty of new convert in these meeting before sometimes it just take some prodding from the faithful at a meeting in algona earlier in the day a group of seven gathered in the library 's kitchen rental fee nearly all sander supporter already they were there to get more information to disseminate out to their friend i belong to two social organization in fenton valerie cole a year old from fenton said after the meeting a she strategized how to win over her friend you get familiar with these lady you go up for coffee i find out a lot more that 's where all the gossip is at i can leave some packet up there surprisingly a lot of the outreach work with older iowan in these rural community is being done online everyone at the algona meeting talked about how they would share the information on facebook when he first started saying thing on facebook that 's where i started paying attention to him cole said of how she first came to know about sander on the senior front sander himself ha just recently switched up his famously focused economic inequality stump speech to a more social security focused message near the top of his rally message behind the scene however this work ha been going on for some time bruce will complete his th of these meeting soon and wo n't even venture a guess at how many mile he 's put on his van turnout for his small meeting only range in the dozen but they 're slowly moving a difficult constituency over to sander ' side it 's an old fashioned approach to an old fashioned audience and one that can be difficult to quantify but if you read the recent polling in iowa something is clearly happening here and if sander can win over just a few more older iowan to his corner on caucus night he might pull off that upset i used to be a hillary supporter but i 'm not anymore cole said 'when i got this stuff from bernie on my computer that 's what changed my mind we wa just telling u what actually wa going on in congress,2669.0

that he is not saying despite all the howling from the right is that he intends to take away american ' gun yet equally significant is the realization that individual citizen are unwilling to free themselves of the destructive weapon that are wreaking havoc on our society numerous american care more about their individual freedom than our collective freedom and they are unable to see how these individualistic desire undermine the essential fabric of a democracy this democratic fabric includes the second amendment that ha been contorted misinterpreted and applied in a way that destroys it intended meaning and threatens the safety and stability of our nation and a the president pointed out on tuesday this grotesque emphasis on the second amendment impairs other american ' ability to freely exercise many of the other amendment a president obama forge a lone path toward gun regulation we must wonder how we a a society have arrived to a point where 'a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arm shall not be infringed ha morphed into allowing individual citizen to posse firearm for their individual protection with little to no concern about the security of a free state it is well documented that gun sale and gun related death have increased since obama came into office but the supreme court 's decision in district of columbia v heller pdf which opened the floodgate and redefined the second amendment rarely receives mention the court 's decision in the case went against year of legal interpretation of the second amendment that stated in united state v miller that the 'obvious purpose of the second amendment wa to 'assure the continuation and render possible the effectiveness of the state militia and the amendment 'must be interpreted and applied with that end in view in heller and then in mcdonald v city of chicago the supreme court in a pair of decision determined that federal state and local government could not create restriction that could prevent an individual the right to posse a firearm in the home for self defense the intent of the second amendment had shifted from allowing citizen to own firearm so that they could band together in an organized and regulated militia run by either local state or federal government to allowing citizen to own gun for their own purpose so long a they fell under the individual 's definition of self defense not surprisingly countless american purchased more and more firearm to protect themselves from the 'inevitable moment when the government or 'obama wa going to forcefully take their gun away not surprisingly a byproduct of this new interpretation of the second amendment ha been a rise in unregulated militia or american terrorist group who challenge the authority of federal state and local government ammon bundy and his posse of men who call themselves the citizen for constitutional freedom who just this week forcefully took over a federal building in malheur national wildlife refuge in oregon are just one such iteration of this emboldened unregulated militia movement in america the oath keeper formed

looter to prevent the destruction of property they also advocated that ferguson resident obtain firearm so that they could protect themselves from the police instability terror and death are the inevitable outcome of a heavily armed citizenry yet in the case nunn v state of georgia pdf an integral case that the supreme court used in the heller decision the state of georgia'my home state'argued that arming citizen and allowing them to openly carry firearm created a safer environment and the referencing of this decision only continues the supreme court 's idyllic reimagining of america 's southern state georgia in wa a slave holding state where african american were counted a three fifth of a person and were not allowed the right to vote firearm at this time were regularly used to keep black in line and sustain the south 's racist oppressive society additionally duel were a regular occurrence in the south during this time period in this volatile environment carrying a firearm out in the open actually did bring about stability the reason for this wa that carrying a concealed weapon wa illegal therefore the assumption within society wa that most white men owned or carried a gun so being able to see everyone 's gun made it le likely that anyone would be killed by a surprise bullet additionally gun could not be removed from the society because they were needed to oppress intimidate and terrorize black in the state this wa a society whose infrastructure and logic regarding social stability should no longer be applicable to modern society yet in recent year it ha been to disastrous effect democracy and valuing human life were not principle that were celebrated in the pre civil war south but far from rejecting that old logic we 've embraced it and the application of the south 's antithetical principle have brought instability danger and a disregard for human life to rest of the united state armed and dangerous and unregulated militia are on the rise in addition to the numerous lone wolf attack that befall school office shopping center and public space at a disturbing frequency right now the second amendment is being applied in a way that take away the right of thousand of american each year and the president must address this crisis to ensure the safety and stability of not just the american citizen who are threatened by gun violence but also the ideal and institution that govern our society that are being threatened by the archaic notion of stability from a racist and oppressive society and the unregulated militia of today that openly advocate armed conflict against the government obama is not going to take away america 's gun i would argue that he should a countless american have displayed a gross misuse of the social responsibility that come with gun ownership except that using force to attempt to disarm people of their firearm might inevitably lead to more violence and bloodshed gun owner should want to regulate and reduce their gun usage for the greater good but our society is too consumed with the myopia of employing lethal force to resolve minor dispute that it can not imagine an environment without widespread gun usage and countless american are unable to see that their gun usage actually jeopardizes the very freedom and liberty they have chosen to fight for and defend via the barrel of a gun,46359.0

what the two allegedly did 'it could possibly be my last wedding because i do n't want to be in this kind of situation again clemons said ever since he discovered his blessing could cause an unholy outcome the pastor say he 's been repenting 'in prayer the behind bar love affair becoming an official marriage could grant a lifeline for two accused killer like any wedding nelson and fletcher set a date december and a venue a visitation cubicle inside the jackson county missouri detention center 'there wa glass between them pastor clemons said of the unorthodox ceremony 'we had phone and we prayed and we talked about studying the bible nelson wa outfitted in an orange jumpsuit and a kiss wa out of the question so the couple improvised 'palms on glass clemons said 'no exchange of ring no kiss i left them alone after that and at the time the pastor never had any reason to question their motif either 'we were there because they felt like god had brought them together and they wanted to be joined in holy matrimony he said and they seemed to be smitten 'i read people 's face and i feel i can see love in people 's face it wa there at the same time i 'm looking at them not knowing they may have committed murder he said that 's what prosecutor say happened on september last year when nelson and davis rolled up to fletcher 's home at p m a source close to the investigation confirmed that nelson 's new girlfriend wa embroiled in 'drama with fletcher who had only just begun dating rollins for 'a few week a source and family member confirmed 'shellana had an issue with the new girlfriend bianca the source said nelson the police report note wa 'sick of it so nelson and davis barged into fletcher 's home 'unannounced to 'chill according to police instead nelson began quarreling with his ex by most of account save for nelson 's where he told cop he wa 'asleep for most of the day and denied any involvement tension rose to the point where fletcher 'threw a diaper at nelson which struck him according to the police report that quote nelson telling his friend mark benson what happened the cop heard two version of what happened next one wa from benson who said the alleged murderer confided in him about the killing the other wa his fianc e davis who gave her own account of the bloodletting either the diaper disgraced nelson rose up pulled out a pistol and fatally shot fletcher before hunting down her boyfriend and his own son otherwise it wa davis that had actually killed nelson and then forced her boyfriend to prove his love by rubbing out potential eyewitness in fletcher 's boyfriend and his own boy benson told police that nelson and davis picked him up following the slaying and that davis wa inconsolable wailing a they all drove off together when they arrived at nelson 's home the two talked on the porch nelson according to the police report announced 'i wa there and saw it so other thing had to be done benson say nelson right then copped to the worst of crime 'i did something bad he said 'i did something i do n't think i can live with ' i killed them i killed them the diaper toss forced nelson to go berserk 'i lost it he told benson according to the police report when asked why nelson shot to death fletcher 's boyfriend and his own cry son he answered point blank 'witnesses apparently the report add nelson felt that jojo 's cry would have drawn too much attention nelson allegedly gave the murder weapon and a bag of shell casing to benson who told authority he got rid of them benson also said that nelson charbroiled his and davis 's blood stained clothes in a barbeque pit and that nelson 'showered numerous time and washed his hand with bleach davis 's version mostly square with benson 's save for a few detail she told police that the visit to fletcher 's seemed civil that the couple wa sitting together inside fletcher 's living room that word got heated fletcher asked why nelson brought along his new flame to her home then thing went wrong nelson ordered fletcher to sit down and according to davis she refused instead she tossed a 'household item at nelson which missed him 'nelson then shot fletcher according to the police report a frozen davis winced a she watched a nelson 'check to see if she wa dead davis said then she 'heard another gunshot and turned her head away before she 'then ran out of the house she did n't remain outside for long nelson apparently ordered her back inside to collect 'as many shell casing a she could find cop ultimately caught up to nelson and prosecutor hit him with a raft of murder charge while davis remained free a detective were busy trying to build a case that she wa at least culpable in the triple homicide davis reached out to pastor clemons about getting married to the accused murderer sitting in jail 'shellana wa very emphatic clemons said 'she contacted me several time and and wanted to get in there and do this the first call he remembered davis simply asked if he could marry incarcerated couple 'she called and asked 'do you do wedding at the jackson county detention center ' and i told her 'i had done them we can talk about it and meet down there the caseworker ha to approve it and there 's plenty of time to talk ' the pastor is struggling with the fallout since the news hit the couple wa hitched yet he insists there were others in place to put a halt the couple 's wedding 'i did not research their background the people that issue the license do that it ha to go through a caseworker in the jail it went through a string of people before i wa allowed to come into that environment and do that a month before nelson and davis became husband and wife jackson county 's prosecuting caught wind of the pending nuptials and raced to depose nelson before it wa too late 'the state ha now learned that on october the defendant and m davis have filed an application with the jackson county missouri recorder of deed for a marriage license jean peter baker wrote in a motion otherwise davis 's 'testimony in some respect could become unavailable to the state after she is married to the defendant so the the prosecutor pleaded with the judge to be able to 'preserver davis ' testimony by deposing her on video unfortunately it appears the judge did n't act in time to approve the motion prosecutor have since filed another motion for special bond condition so that nelson 'be ordered to have no contact with any of the witness in the case including his wife the fact that nelson ha 'shown a willingness to contact witness ' ha been done for the purpose of impacting testimony the prosecution face multiple obstacle before the trial get underway in october especially regarding any statement by the former miss davis against her new husband say frank bowman a professor at the university of missouri law school first she may have some criminal liability even if she did n't kill anyone since she allegedly admitted helping cover up the crime bowman said therefore she can avoid testifying simply on the basis of her fifth amendment to not incriminate herself which would be available to her even if she wa n't married to nelson the prosecution could surmount this hurdle by asking the judge to grant her immunity from any charge in this case bowman added second missouri ha a 'spousal testimony privilege that mean the new mr nelson can refuse to testify against her husband about thing 'that happened during the marriage but also thing that happened before the marriage bowman said like these killing however if the prosecutor can convince the judge that the marriage wa a 'sham entered into for the purpose of creating a testimonial privilege the privilege could be rendered void 'even if that marriage had all the bell and whistle like a marriage certificate'if it wa meant to bar her from testifying then the privilege doe n't apply bowman said a partial solution to the privilege problem may lie in the fact that missouri law void the spousal privilege in case with victim under a two of the decedent were bowman said using this statute might require two different trial one for the minor victim and one for the adult finally if mr nelson ca n't be compelled to testify against her husband you might think the prosecutor could use the statement she made to the police before she married and clammed up however those statement may be barred by the 'confrontation clause of the constitution and rule against 'hearsay both those barrier might vanish if the judge belief the defendant engineered his 'wife 's silence by marrying her her father andrew hill doe n't believe it wa a match made in love 'i 'm trying to get answer he told the daily beast adding that nelson corrupted his daughter 'she wa on a good track and then she fucked it up she met him and he 's a bad person and he ha a bad history 'i 'm lost right now and trying to figure out how this happened still getting pas the legal hurdle will be easier than getting over the three life lost that night 'at the end of the day a loved one is gone rollins ' uncle lee washington who say he helped raise the promising dancer told the daily beast 'no matter if this guy and his woman go back in the jail for the rest of their life i do n't get any satisfaction because shannon 's life wa taken the family ha been 'pitching in to raise rollins 's son who is now fatherless the fact that his nephew 's alleged killer are now married further salt the wound torn open by bullet 'the only way we get justice is if we kill that motherfucker ourselves and that ai n't going to happen he said 'and if they dupe the system it really doe n't matter because we still lost shannon we still have a great kid gone that ha a child left here without a father the funeral wa especially tough his uncle said 'we buried him on his th birthday washington remembered of rollins a a handsome heartbreaker 'shannon had a great smile and very likeable and wa too smart for his own good he said 'shannon had so many girl it wa ridiculous we had to change school because had so many girlfriend the proud father who worked night shift at various odd job to support his baby wa a mean to a greater end 'his main goal in life wa to get into showbiz washington said rollins went by the moniker akira kenzo a k a whiteout in a series of homemade solo dance video featuring rollins gyrating his body to base thumping heavy synthed track sometimes he collaborated with another kc dancer named motherboard to form 'whiteout but for all his talent and natural athleticism it wa a slow rise to fame a few month back put up a testimonial on youtube admitting how much of a struggle it 's been to shine a a dancer in his hometown 'everybody on here y'all my family i love y'all ' this

i 'm straight man that 's all i need help me out the grieving uncle who helped raise rollins said he wa very much a victim of 'being at the wrong place wrong time but the real tragedy is that the gun toting nelson became unhinged over a diaper toss 'we have a society that turn out people like joseph nelson washington said 'he came up through the system he wa abandoned and he wa forsaken 'nobody

to his freedom a evidence that he had been in the shootout 'joanne chesimard she worked on taking it out vickers reported to the first informant vickers 's account shifted to the name chesimard adopted a she became known a the soul of the black liberation army 'assata shakur she took the bullet out vickers said vickers recalled convalescing for a time in new jersey and continuing on to philadelphia 'then i wa ready vickers told the first informant 'we started some more shit police believe that this included the assassination of foster and laurie who had served together with the marine in vietnam only to be gunned down in the street of new york a duffle bag wa found at the murder scene containing a number of item one a bomb making manual 'when those cop got killed down in the village my fingerprint showed up on some stuff that wa laid behind on a couple of book vickers told the second informant 'my fingerprint show up on a couple of book but they could n't get me on nothing a month later vickers wa arrested for the non fatal shooting of a cop in newark n j the fingerprint from the scene of the double assassination in new york proved only that he had handled the bomb making manual at some time and he wa not charged he wa indicted for the earlier shootout in harlem in which two cop were wounded but a mistrial wa followed by the acquittal that made even vickers

the little coke baggies but they were n't being disruptive and it wa n't worth a confrontation it also did n't really bother smith a year old freelance writer that much when she could hear the couple having sex on the couch even though they had specifically rented out a bedroom space with you know a door 'we 're like 'that 's weird they have a room ' but we thought 'whatever it 's new year 's eve ' we 're not going to be like 'stop having sex on out couch ' that 's just impoliteness smith just wa n't too thrown by the partying airbnb guest even though she had gotten married only hour earlier

wa our wedding day and eight hour before we got an instant booking smith explained 'we called to cancel but they the guest said 'please do n't it 's going to be impossible to find a new place ' so

going to have their naked friend on my couch they 're not going to clean up their mess that wa my train of logic while certainly logical most people would let their outrage get the better of them at this point instead smith spoke to her husband who seemed remarkably even more polite and level headed about the unexpected airbnb fracas he went to the bedroom in the apartment where the two people who actually booked through airbnb were sleeping she said 'my husband knocked on the door and said 'i 'm sorry to wake you but there are stranger on our couch ' according to smith the couple who she

additional canadian dollar for having more guest than they reported but other than that she had no long term ire towards the group 'they 're from ottawa it 's a boring town they probably came to the city and went a little too crazy they probably realized it wa inappropriate but they were just enjoying being young and crazy and not really regarding the consequence smith said she also appreciated that the guest did make an earnest effort to clean her apartment 'they did n't deep clean my apartment or anything but they did a good job cleaning it wa n't a half assed cleaning a trying a this

fought he agreed to live next door carlos aucapina did not respond to request for comment on this article from the daily beast in november carlos aucapina told the east hampton star he consented to his wife 's request for a protective order because she needed 'more space a the daily beast previously reported lilia aucapina wa last seen oct at a medical practice parking lot in wainscott that morning carlos aucapina had confronted lilia and a male friend in a heated encounter that prompted the friend to call police authority said aucapina had reportedly brought along lilia 's brother carlos parra and both left before cop arrived relative confirmed lilia 's college aged son reported his mother missing that night after relative were unable to reach her southampton and east hampton police separately arrested carlos for violating the order of protection shortly after lilia 's disappearance it 's unclear what 's become of criminal contempt charge against him meanwhile duchi told the daily beast that the day lilia aucapina got the protective order 'she wa so happy it wa the best day of her life on behalf of aucapina 's family advocacy group latinojustice sent a letter to southampton 's town supervisor asking for the aucapina case to be reopened by the suffolk county police department which'unlike local departments'has a dedicated homicide squad the dec missive highlight what activist call a weak investigation especially since aucapina 's body wa found in 'plain view in this lightly wooded area east com reported 'whatever their exact reasoning the town police viewed the discovery of her body a confirmation that she had committed suicide and continued their refusal to expand the investigation or have trained homicide detective take over the letter state the letter came one week after people gathered outside southampton 's town hall to demand justice for lilia holding poster board with her photo and sign that read ' day to find body that wa min from home incredible 'even if police completely blew the search or this wa a staged suicide there 's evidence of criminality or certainly they should have continued to look at it a a crime maer said maer told the daily beast that aucapina 's family wanted to search for her but police warned against it and duchi told the the daily beast 'we wanted to search around her house and in the area and the detective kept telling u not to do it because we were going to get in trouble if we did telling u that we could damage their investigation 'and we all know that this wa not a good investigation due to the fact that with cadaver dog and so much help from different agency they could n't find her body she said when asked why cop canine did n't find lilia 's body southampton police lieutenant susan ralph told east com 'it can be the wind direction and if the wind is blowing the scent away from the dog the dog would n't pick it up it wa heavily foliaged plus the ground cover wa high so it is thicket that you would have to be able to get into ralph added 'with all those factor she wa missed astarita carlos aucapina 's lawyer also seized on the foliage explanation telling east com 'police had searched the area but in the last six week the leaf have dropped and the area ha been more accessible but advocate for lilia aucapina are n't buying it 'what stunned everybody here is that she is hanging in the wood a couple hundred foot from her house a couple hundred foot from the street maer told the daily beast 'police said they did repeated search throughout the area that very same spot 'at first we presumed boy they did a really bad job unbelievably bad that they could leave body hanging at eye level he added but then latinojustice called police expert dan montgomery to independently evaluate aucapina 's case latinojustice had previously used montgomery a retired colorado police chief with year ' experience to analyze gabriela armijos 's death like the aucapina clan armijos 's family is also calling for a new investigation by suffolk county police instead of the hampton ' cop armijos had left ecuador for east hampton in summer of in sept of that year she went to her job at a hair salon and never returned her family reported she often walked through a wooded area to get there they say they checked the supposed no man 's land'which is littered with liquor bottle and broken lawn chair and is reportedly a hangout for drinking and drugs'then called police east com reported the woman 's body wa discovered there the next day by a family friend searching the area according to east com armijos wa seeking asylum in america after escaping an abusive childhood with her father day before armijos 's death her family grew concerned when she came home late with her clothes mysteriously covered in dirt armijos told her sister she 'd gotten lost on her way back from work in his september report for latinojustice which wa reviewed by the daily beast montgomery observed that 'police unreasonably refused to go into the wood to search for m armijos because it wa reportedly 'too dangerous ' for them to do so the night before her body wa found montgomery also questioned the east hampton police work saying investigator allegedly failed to secure the crime scene to protect potential evidence among other alleged oversight armijos 's brother in law told crime scene investigator he saw two set of footprint about foot from the woman 's body according to montgomery investigator allegedly never took photograph of the print nor they did examine an abandoned mattress nearby montgomery said in his report investigator also failed to 'thoroughly investigate and interview an ex boyfriend armijos had broken up with before her death the man met armijos online before she moved to the united state and she dumped him because he provided a false profile photo of himself montgomery wrote 'this matter need to be fully investigated by trained homicide investigator montgomery concluded in his report 'there are simply what seasoned investigator call too many 'loose end ' east hampton police have n't commented on montgomery 's report which became public in october back then police captain chris anderson told the independent 'all i can say is after an investigation wa conducted in conjunction with the medical examiner 's office it wa ruled a suicide and the case wa closed armijos 's sister alexandra pucha told the daily beast that report of lilia aucapina 's disappearance hit too close to home 'for me it wa very difficult the year old said through a translator 'it wa like seeing my sister 's case all over again 'i 'm not convinced by what police said happened to her pucha said about her sister 's alleged suicide 'whenever i asked

ambitious provocative macintosh ad which cast apple a rabble rouser disrupting some orwellian dystopia and in a way saving the human race through computers'specifically their computer job is on a tear hell bent on kicking off the macintosh launch event with his computer speaking the word 'hello there 's a glitch and the team might not pull it off an inexcusable turn of event that would ruin everything job is setting out to do destroy the a space odyssey esque notion that computer are scary thing with sharp edge he want to make them friendly and accessible human even michael fassbender the actor who ha already earned golden globe screen actor guild and critic choice award nomination for his portrayal of job laugh when he think about how committed to that mission job wa and how successful it became 'when the macintosh first came out people were like wow it 's great but it 's a toy i would n't know what to do with it he say 'it 's funny that it wa the first evolution of what would later become the imac the computer that were candy colored you almost wanted to lick them or eat them if job ' goal wa to foster a relationship between human and these machine it 's undeniable that all these year later he accomplished it 'now we live in a world where people take their laptop into bed with them and keep their phone besides their bed and have phone in their hand most of the day fassbender say 'it 's almost like another limb it went beyond a functionary thing we 've developed relationship with these device for me i thought that wa extraordinary in many way though fassbender is outlining what would become the biggest hurdle for the steve job filmmaker in creating a movie that attempted to make big scary steve jobs'with his own hard edge otherwordly reputation and deified cultural status'like that macintosh in accessible it 's a movie that set out to change our relationship with a man we 've sainted a a visionary and whose notorious drive'that vision'defined him it set out to make him human fittingly there 's a line in steve job that 's job 's own 'hello job is asked by longtime collaborator steve wozniak played by seth rogen how he manages to perfect the creation of product that are revolutionizing how human interact with the world all the while failing in his own interaction with the people in his world his response 'i 'm poorly made it 's a pivotal moment in aaron sorkin 's screenplay halting a whirlwind time spanning narrative with a jolt of emotional clarity 'the object that he 's making he wanted them to be better fassbender say 'but these machine they could n't take him beyond his own personal limitation and shortcoming you know much of steve job center on the character 's likability or rather the frustration of those in his life that he wa n't always that 'it 's not binary wozniak tell him 'you can be decent and gifted at the same time at another point job say 'i do n't want people to dislike me i 'm indifferent to whether they dislike me but it 's three word '' i 'm poorly made 'that jettison the importance of his likability altogether it alters our understanding of who steve job wa forget likable or machiavellian or arrogant or genius it 's simpler than any of that he wa human fassbender is on his second round of press in support of steve job now on the campaign trail for what he hope will be a best actor oscar nod for his performance the website goldderby com which aggregate prediction from the industry 's top award blogger and professional suggests that fassbender 's nomination is all but a certainty even if the film 's best picture hope have dwindled a bit few film released this year earned more press and medium fascination'perhaps predictably'than steve job but it 's been ruled somewhat a disappointment at the box office something that danny boyle himself owned up to when the film opened in the u k a month after it stateside release it million domestic gross almost exactly mirror the much derided job biopic starring ashton kutcher which grossed million despite having more than twice the budget fassbender once playfully joked 'i studied kutcher when asked how he prepped for his own performance fassbender is a confused a many culture writer a to why the film wa n't a much of a commercial hit a pundit pegged it to be 'i think the landscape of how we watch film a adult ha changed he say predicting that most of the film 's target audience will likely devour it at home when it becomes available 'i think that 's evident in film that are at cinema mainstream wise where the demographic are teenager teenage boy and that 's the reality of the landscape so that would be my guess still praise for his performance ha been near unanimous hour before our conversation fassbender had picked up a trophy at the palm spring film festival for his performance could he win the oscar the talk around tinseltown is deafening about leonardo dicaprio 's work in the revenant namely all of the survivalist trial and tribulation the actor had to endure while shooting the film that 's all well and good but fassbender had to weather the machine gun dialogue of an aaron sorkin screenplay pulling that off is it own harrowing act of survival but what 's more interesting perhaps is the way in which sorkin director danny boyle and fassbender work together to buck what ha become a groan worthy award season trend biopics that canonize it subject at the expense of offering a human truth 'truth of course is it own conversation in relation to steve job which play fast and loose with timeline history and quite flagrantly with a few fact in the effort of serving it daring story structure 'historians tell you what happened dramatist tell you what it felt like is sorkin 's defense of that the result is something maybe more compelling a true to fact depiction of history the depiction of a legacy perhaps because of this those close to the history like current apple ceo tim cook have criticized the film cook called it 'opportunistic fassbender himself expressed concern that job ' family might feel 'betrayed by his depiction 'you 're playing a person who 's got loved one he say clarifying that he ha n't heard from any member of job 's family since the film wa released 'i wanted to totally respect that and respect the man but coming just four year after job ' death doe the film affect his legacy 'i think the legacy is all around u fassbender say 'he did change the world i think when you change the world you leave yourself open to our story being told he himself commissioned someone to write an autobiography about him so obviously he wanted the world to tell his story fassbender go on to list all the way job ha changed the way we live our life how we communicate how we play how we watch movie or listen to music even how we shop 'outside of that i do n't know what steve job wa like he say 'i never met the man i never spent time with him the only impression i had wa from the medium and what people said about him but like i say the legacy is the legacy and that is something you ca n't argue with because we 're all living it that legacy of course go in tandem with an image an indelible image of a man in a black turtleneck and blue levi 's gazing through small spectacle a he changed the world it 's an image that nearly did n't appear in steve job at least not until fassbender himself spoke up much wa made before the film went into production about how fassbender and job look nothing alike 'it 's actually something i said myself to danny when he approached me with the role he say 'i said 'i do n't really look anything like the man ' he said 'i 'm not really interested in that i do n't want to do an imitation ' boyle actually felt that an actor who too closely resembled job would be a distraction with the audience spending too much time marveling or dissecting the exactness of the look by making a strong statement from the start that this actor doe not look like this person the audience can get over it in the first five minute originally fassbender wa set to wear a suit for the film 's third act but suggested while they were still filming the second act that the put him in job ' iconic uniform for the finale 'i thought the audience would appreciate that and we should give it to them he say for moviegoer it 's an exhilarating moment the sharp edge had softened this wa steve job it 's also when fassbender fittingly enough say he felt most like the character 'in the uniform it really felt like i had arrived at the vision that the person had arrived ha he worn a black turtleneck since 'i have not he laugh 'but that 's not to say i wo n't again,5266.0

also known a revenge porn goldberg serf on the board of the cyber civil right initiative ccri and a a volunteer attorney for the organization 's end revenge porn erp initiative when someone'usually but not always a woman according to erp statistics'discovers that sexual image or video of herself have been posted online without her consent her first instinct is usually to get them taken down right away but rushing to remove them goldberg say can make it difficult to penalize the offender who in the majority of revenge porn case is an ex boyfriend 'the kneejerk reaction for most victim is to immediately do whatever they can to remove the content even though the content is really necessary to prove a criminal or a civil case said goldberg goldberg 's brooklyn law firm specializes in case of internet privacy abuse domestic violence and sexual consent in her practice she advises revenge porn victim to record a much evidence a they can including message sent by the offender view count upload date and even the comment section below the post ' comment tend to be very violent and graphic goldberg explained 'comments are instructional because if you 're trying to get the police or a judge to understand the harm of revenge porn'and how the consumer of revenge porn end up becoming harasser by proxy'then the comment show that wa the year when silicon valley finally began to take revenge porn more seriously twitter facebook reddit and google all formally announced ban on the practice in which sexual photo taken without consent or within a relationship are disseminated online often alongside the victim 's full name or contact information in october pornhub the largest porn website on the internet also launched a new content removal form for revenge porn victim to file takedown request more easily it wa also the year when revenge porn legislation crossed a tipping point now twenty six state and the district of columbia have law pertaining to revenge porn with bill pending in several other state but even a legislative and technological support for victim grows many woman are still uncertain about what they should do in the immediate aftermath of discovering image of themselves online one week ago for instance a reddit user posting under a burner account on the twoxchromosomes subreddit said that she wa shocked to find pornographic video of her and her boyfriend on the internet 'what are my option she asked 'where do i turn the most reliable option is digit long the ccri run a free helpline for u s victim of nonconsensual pornography in addition to calling that number goldberg ha several crucial piece of advice for revenge porn victim first she say victim should quickly adjust their social medium privacy setting setting up two factor authentication for added security 'as soon a the victim realizes that she 's been the victim of revenge porn she need to lock down her social medium she said this step is essential because ex and other offender often post the image on dedicated revenge porn website along with identifying information or derogatory statement about the victim that may encourage stalking harassment or hacking attempt forty nine percent of respondent to an erp survey said that their nonconsensually posted image were accompanied by their social medium handle or a screenshot of their profile sixteen percent said their home address wa attached to the material an important aside although goldberg tell victim to make their social medium account more secure she also advises against blocking the offender from sending incoming message a vile a they might be so that they can be used in a criminal or civil case then to discover just how far the revenge porn ha spread goldberg recommends that victim google themselves alongside derogatory term such a 'slut or 'my slutty ex 'the victim 's name alone might not come up with link to revenge porn but if you add the word 'whore ' after her name or something that the offender would have posted alongside her name that can lead to more material she told the daily beast 'it 's so important for the victim to know the breadth of the attack after evidence collection victim face two concurrent task taking legal action and getting the offensive material wiped from the web the latter task can be dizzyingly complex but erp 's online removal guide contains instruction for submitting removal request to social medium service like facebook instagram twitter reddit and tumblr and to search engine like yahoo google and bing without a removal form victim must directly contact webmaster asking for removal and stipulating that all metadata be preserved for future litigation'requests that goldberg say often wo n't be honored without a subpoena barring that if a victim can claim copyright to the material'a selfie for instance'a digital millennium copyright act dmca takedown letter might do the trick 'there are n't a lot of rule on the internet but one set of rule that most online service provider and webmaster take seriously are copyright rule so that can be a very powerful tool for victim said goldberg legal recourse for revenge porn victim is a similarly patchwork system although the majority of state now have revenge porn law on the book not all law are created equal some require proof of intent to cause distress in order to prosecute some have weak punishment others have exemption for public figure goldberg hold up illinois ' new revenge porn law a an example of an ironclad piece of legislation but say that otherwise the field is 'split between effective and ineffective law 'these case should be very easy to prosecute because the distribution is the proof she said 'the fact that the image are on the internet is the proof of the crime but they can prove challenging nonetheless if the victim and the offender live in different state for example law enforcement in each state may a goldberg say 'tell her to report it to the other state if victim ca n't get revenge porn legislation to work in their favor'or if neither they nor the offender live in a state where these law apply'litigators still have other option in addition to pursuing civil action revenge porn may often involve other related crime that can be criminally prosecuted 'if the victim doe not live in a state where there is a revenge porn law there may be other law that were broken goldberg explained were the picture taken without consent that could be covered under unlawful surveillance law say goldberg is the victim underage child porn law would likely apply is the offender stalking harassing or threatening the victim that can be reported too in many instance a victim can also seek a restraining order against the offender and take action if he violates it 'frankly i a a civil lawyer do n't have the patience to wait for every state to pas law goldberg told the daily beast 'it is a space where there is no playbook we 're creating the method a we go along above all goldberg tell victim to get in touch with erp right away so that they can understand that they are not alone and that this nightmare is not their fault 'we deal with victim of privacy invasion and this form of sexual violence all day every day she said 'and victim likely do n't know anybody else who 's dealing with this it can be a very isolating miserable experience so it 's important that they get in touch with support a soon a possible,11542.0

where cosby will face accusation of sexual assault by andrea constand is a rematch between defense attorney brian mcmonagle and kevin steele the new district attorney of montgomery county pennsylvania two year ago the two attorney battled in court over another powerful man accused of drugging and sexually assaulting a woman under his influence for the past year mcmonagle ha defended high profile client like killer cop alleged mobster and accused rapists'and he ha won a large majority of case thanks in part to his experience on the other side of the courtroom a a prosecutor from to mcmonagle worked in the homicide unit of the philly d a 's office earning admiration of colleague and defendant alike the public servant said he entered private practice to earn more money for his growing family but that did n't dull his edge 'i like battle and i like competition he said in a tv ad for his law firm 'when you hire u you 've hired someone who may not guarantee you a win but will guarantee you a war arguing the government 's case against cosby is steele a year veteran of the d a 's office steele wa elected to be top prosecutor in november after beating the former d a bruce castor who left but wanted his old job back steele used castor 's decision in not to prosecute cosby in order to paint castor a soft on predator mcmonagle and steele declined to speak to the daily beast for this story steele is possessed by a similar drive a mcmonagle evidenced by the wristband he is said to wear every day that read 'david grove grove wa a wildlife conservation officer who wa murdered and steel wa called in by another county 's d a to assist in getting a conviction thanks to his experience in trying and winning capital case steele did just that helping send send christopher johnson to death row in a year later another high profile case landed on steele 's desk robert kern wa the chairman of the montgomery county republican party and a partner at the kern pearlstine onorato hladik law firm in november a grand jury charged kern with aggravated indecent assault the same charge a cosby for allegedly drugging and raping a woman who worked for him with steele standing besides her district attorney rose vetri ferman announced kern 's arrest and detailed the state 's case against him in a press conference on october a year old paralegal at kern 's firm went to a company party at a restaurant the woman said she had a few drink and wa concerned about driving herself to a nearby mall to go shopping with a friend kern said he had to go there anyway and offered to give her a lift saying he would also take her back to the restaurant later to retrieve her car instead according to prosecutor kern gave the woman wine laced with drug then assaulted her in the parking lot and again in her own home an affidavit in the criminal complaint said the woman sustained injury that were visible six day later and internal bleeding that lasted day the woman said she awoke the next morning alone in her own bed nude from the waist down covered in dried vomit her shoulder blade and vagina were sore scratch and bruise were present on her thigh which she photographed with her cell phone the woman said she found her missing pant and underwear on the kitchen counter along with a wine glass that held a bill the woman went to the hospital where medical staff performed a sexual assault examination that noted the presence of a man 's dna and genital laceration the woman told detective she had few clear memory of the night before but remembers getting into kern 's car and he telling her to pour two glass of wine from an open bottle she said she drank some but did not see kern do so kern had laced the wine with the sleeping drug ambien grand jury found investigator obtained a search warrant and found vomit inside his mercedes and found in the trunk pink duct tape an open bottle of vodka and lubricating jelly kern told detective the alleged victim had started vomiting in the car and that he stayed in the mall 's parking garage while tending to her before taking her home detective also taped phone conversation between kern and a friend at his firm who agreed to be recorded he denied assaulting the woman when asked directly but when the friend told him that the woman had injury consistent with rape and that the evidence against kern seemed strong 'if it is it is kern said 'you know that 's why i got mcmonagle at a preliminary hearing the first and only time the accuser appeared in court she testified she had only 'obscure dream like memory of my head up against the window of the car and pushing kern away once at home she said she knew it wa happening but it wa like i had no wherewithal to do anything about it mcmonagle pressed her to provide detail of event that she had already testified occurred while she wa either unconscious or incapacitated'like what time she had removed her pant and underwear hospital record did 'depict some bruising mcmonagle admitted but there wa no evidence indicating 'that there had been intercourse of any kind in this case he told the judge before asking him to dismiss the charge of rape and aggravated indecent assault prosecutor samantha cauffman who argued the case at kern 's preliminary hearing told the judge that the woman 'has penetration injury she ha tear and rip violent intercourse is the only thing that could have caused damage to her inside the judge ordered the case go to trial but then mcmonagle hired two expert to analyze the toxicology report that found ambien in the wine and they found an error in how the report had been interpreted to the grand jury that meant the grand jury had indicted kern based in part on misleading testimony on march steele told a judge that his office wa dropping the charge because of the technical error mcmonagle gave prosecutor a nod for their swift action to remedy their mistake 'i 'm confident that this wa an honest mistake made by the district attorney 's office and upon learning of it they did the right thing and put an end to this horrible nightmare he said in october citing misstep in the kern case d a ferman and steele announced they had commissioned a third party to review the prosecution and were creating two new position to oversee trial and professional standard the pennsylvania attorney general took up the case and kern later pleaded no contest to two misdemeanor he wa sentenced to two year probation made to register a a sex offender pay a fine of and pay his victim in restitution steele will have a much harder time proving cosby sexually assaulted and drugged constand if for no other reason that there is no physical evidence this time instead steele is going to try to use cosby 's own word against him from a deposition in constand 's civil case in that deposition cosby admitted to giving woman drug before he had sex with them though he say it wa consentual but there 's a catch mcmonagle 's filing last wee to dismiss the charge contained a claim that steele 's 'new evidence from constand 's civil suit is off limit to the prosecution because ex d a castor promised that his office would never bring criminal charge against the comedian for the alleged assault in return for cosby 's deposition castor emailed steele 's predecessor a d a a few month ago telling her he 'agreed more than a decade ago not to use cosby 's civil deposition in a criminal case against him cnn report 'i can see no possibility that cosby 's deposition could be used in a state criminal case because i would have to testify a to what happened and the deposition would be subject to suppression steele say the email doe n't stymie his case because castor 's verbal promise is not legally binding for steele 's office 'there is a specific legal method to grant immunity that wa not done in he told cnn indeed mcmonagle 's motion doe not cite any explicit agreement not to prosecute mcmonagle 's motion also reference steele 's political campaign built around cosby the motion cite steel 's own description of tv commercial public statement and flyer critical of castor 's decision to not prosecute cosby 'a crucial new phase of his campaign mcmonagle say this should rule steele out a an impartial broker so the judge should disqualify him from the trying the case 'my office doe not try any case in the court of public opinion steele said in a statement last week 'we try them in a court of law we will be filing a response to their motion and we will let our legal response to their motion speak for itself if a judge let the trial proceed steele will ty to strengthen his case against cosby by bringing forward a many a woman to testify that cosby did the same thing to them a constand pennsylvania law allows 'other crime wrong or act to be offered a 'habit evidence against defendant prosecutor will try to establish cosby 's alleged pattern of seducing drugging and assaulting woman mcmonagle of course will argue they should n't testify if they do mcmonagle will not go easy on them for example in mcmonagle defended philadelphia police officer fred gaethers who wa charged with raping a woman he had offered to pay for sex the woman wa a a health care professional but mcmonagle forced her to admit she had once been a prostitute when gaethers wa found not guilty he grinned and thanked the jury meanwhile his alleged victim reportedly 'buried her face in her hand and began sobbing in the back row of the courtroom still mcmonagle will have his work cut out for him say michael pileggi a federal civil right and criminal defense attorney whose client were recently cross examined by mcmonagle 'you have all of these woman coming forward so it 's not just the credibility of one witness pileggi said 'he 's got some mountain to climb i 'll say that he 's going to have to attack each and every witness that includes constand 'from a lawyer 's perspective i think you always have to tread lightly with these type of case pileggi said 'it doe come into the credibility issue it 's always a factor but you know with these sexual case you have to strike a balance because oftentimes it can look like you 're trying to intimidate the witness and that turn jury off on the other hand that 's the one area of attack that he ha the credibility of the witness mcmonagle will have to wait for his first shot at constand on february both side will argue over his motion to dismiss the charge if the magistrate denies it then steele must still meet mcmonagle again at a preliminary hearing to convince to her honor there 's enough evidence to take the case to trial then the rematch will really begin,36398.0

politician he expressed regret 'our public life withers when only the most extreme voice get attention the president said 'it 's one of the few regret of my presidency ' that the rancor and suspicion between the party ha gotten worse instead of better there 's no question this is urgent unfinished business by many objective domestic measure america is better off now than we were seven year ago but we have fallen further behind on this front in then senator obama campaigned on the slogan 'one america an implicit dis to senator john edward proto populist 'two america riff four year before he first rose to national prominence by proclaiming that 'there are no red state or blue state there is only the united state of america the republican field is now littered with first term senator running for president but they are running a divider rather than uniters reacting to a polarized base that seems to reward the loudest and least responsible voice on the democrat side of the aisle an anemic field is essentially bifurcated between a clinton restoration and a resurgent liberal populism led by an avowed democratic socialist the two party are more polarized than ever before and at least one stomach turning poll found that of a majority of millennials do n't think it essential to live in a democracy no wonder president obama said combating this cynical self defeating drift into disillusion and hyper partisanship wa 'maybe the most important thing i want to say tonight in the process the president took aim at trump and tribalism warned against identity politics and offered a three part prescription for reducing polarization in american politics demagogue have always been the dark side of democracy the appeal of a strongman who promise to solve every problem through brute force dividing the country into 'us against 'them wa a fear of the founding father that fear is now embodied by donald trump the president fired off a few brush back pitch in the donald 's direction an unusual move in a state of the union 'we need to reject any politics that target people because of race or religion this is n't a matter of political correctness it 's a matter of understanding what make u strong ' when politician insult muslim when a mosque is vandalized or a kid bullied that doe n't make u safer that 's not telling it like it is it 's just wrong it diminishes u in the eye of the world it make it harder to achieve our goal and it betrays who we are a a country this full throated defense of diversity of a source of strength patriotically name checking muslim and mosque alongside mention of gay right and marriage equality and an extended conversation about climate change is a reminder of how much president obama ha changed the term of the debate over the past eight year and this cultural shift help fuel the frustration of conservative populist who want to 'take america back of course eight year ago it would have been hard to imagine an indian american female governor of south carolina giving the republican response to the first black president our country is changing and perhaps not coincidentally nikki haley also found time in her speech to implicitly dis trump 'some people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference that is just not true often the best thing we can do is turn down the volume when the sound is quieter you can actually hear what someone else is saying and that can make a world of difference haley 's vp audition wa a timely reminder that neither party ha a monopoly on virtue or vice and that good people can disagree civilly in our democracy this dovetailed nicely with president obama 's core caution about the coarseness of our civic debate these day 'democracy doe require basic bond of trust between it citizen it doe n't work if we think the people who disagree with u are all motivated by malice or that our political opponent are unpatriotic an assumption of goodwill between fellow citizen is essential to democracy and that ha eroded with anger and anxiety pimped out by professional polarizers who profit personally and politically from division from talk radio to the split scream of cable tv to the social medium mob who shout down any hint of disagreement the result ha been a ceding of the field to the most hardcore partisan while more modest moderate member of society look at all the mudslinging and think they 've got better thing to do with their time this is the way inmate take over the asylum the result is already a dynamic we recognize 'as frustration grows there will be voice urging u to fall back into tribe to scapegoat fellow citizen who do n't look like u or pray like u or vote like we do or share the same background so how do we begin to heal these division and fix our politics the president laid out three broad prescription redistricting reform 'we have to end the practice of drawing our congressional district so that politician can pick their voter and not the other way around surprisingly this got applause from the assembled member of congress many of whom would n't be in office for decade despite rock bottom approval rating if it were n't for the rigged system of redistricting after all a the president joked 'it 's not much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in america who are going to work the same job in the same place with a health and retirement package for year are sitting in this chamber he wa right to call out gridlock created by legislator afraid to vote for bill they privately support because it could make them vulnerable to a primary challenge even speaker ryan ha denounced this cowardly habit of voting 'no while hoping a bill pass independent redistricting reform is the solution but that wo n't happen until after the census and there need to be leadership well in advance to take advantage of that once in a decade opportunity reducing the influence of big money in politics 'we have to reduce the influence of money in our politics so that a handful of family and hidden interest ca n't bankroll our election the president 's comment stopped well short of calling for a constitutional amendment to overturn citizen united a both hillary clinton and bernie sander have done but that 's not going to move forward a long a republican control congress on the gop side filed under blind squirrel get nut donald trump is the one candidate who ha called out the corrupt bargain behind the super pac charade but aggressive enforcement of existing law by the currently toothless fec would rein in some of the absurd abuse election reform 'we 've got to make voting easier not harder and modernize it for the way we live now and over the course of this year i intend to travel the country to push for reform that do obama also called for this on the night of his re election in response to report of long line at polling place and a bipartisan commission produced an anodyne report that failed to gain much traction amid rolling back of the voting right act but ambitious reform are needed to expand access from online voting to same day registration to reexamining why tuesday remains the only day set aside for voting presidential leadership is needed to make even modest improvement in the stale status quo none of these three are easy or likely to solve the rot on their own they deserve more detailed repeated discussion from the president if they are going to be more than pablum but they are worthy step in the process of pulling our political culture back from the brink the alternative is more dysfunction division and disillusion and ironically some of populist appeal from trump co feed off of voter frustration at the ineffectiveness of washington but their solution is more of the same if you like government shutdown and ideological gridlock you 'll love president ted cruz the alternative vision is competing party representing different philosophy but united by a belief that government can work to solve common problem the presence of paul ryan in the speaker 's chair and nikki haley giving the official response offer reassurance that this vision is not yet dead in the republican party but the larger political shift will require relearning foundational civic truth that george washington first offered up in his farewell address 'citizens by birth or choice the name of american which belongs to you in your national capacity must always exalt the just pride of patriotism more than any appellation derived from local discrimination with slight shade of difference you have the same religion manner habit and political principle we are of course far more diverse than we were a a nation in but the same idea still endure a president obama said in those 'voices that help u see ourselves not first and foremost a black or white or asian or latino not a gay or straight immigrant or native born not a democrat or republican but a american first

's best and whitest then after a beat sorry'brightest it wa a tongue in cheek acknowledgement of one of the biggest scandal to plague the oscar in more than a decade every single acting nominee wa white worse in a year when selma a film about martin luther king jr wa the best reviewed film of the year'but shut out in every race but best picture this year the joke is no longer funny in a year when diversity representation opportunity and normalization wa the driving conversation of show business'and rightfully so'we can now say that this is the whitest oscar ever if you 're looking for a benchmark this is the whitest oscar since last year is n't that disgusting not a single acting nominee this year is a person of color idris elba wa widely predicted to be nominated for beast of no nation he failed to receive a nod the academy found christian bale 's glass eye in the big short more intriguing instead unlike last year which wa infuriating in it own right when selma received a best picture nomination but not a best director ava duvernay or best actor david oyelowo nod there 's not even a black film or a film that concern people of color in the best picture race last year the hashtag oscarssowhite circulated in outrage over the situation this year i 'd be surprised if we could even muster the character anger maybe we 've resigned ourselves the situation is so glaring we need sunglass hollywood need some shaming well allow me here 's the situation yes all oscar nominee are white is that a surprise no there wa really only one person of color who wa considered a likely contender to be nominated'the aforementioned elba he starred in a movie that debuted in netflix which had never launched an award campaign the prevailing sentiment though he wa deserving wa that netflix 's naivet in the world of award push wa going to hurt his chance this ended up being correct despite deserving unequivocally to be nominated and possibly to win for the kind of soul shaking transformative performance that make you reconsider your place in the world and you know give meaning to this ridiculous business of show and validity to the vapidity of hollywood elba find himself shut out beast of no nation wa about child soldier fighting in africa instead the academy rewarded what they consider to be the greatest hardship plaguing society actor doing accent and otherwise whimsical thing oh my god did you even hear the accent christian bale had in the big short it wa well it wa n't clear what it wa but it wa not his normal speaking voice mark ruffalo too he i guess shouted once inspotlight give him an award no give it to that british guy who wa so charming in give me an oscar i 'm a spielberg film 'excuse me bridge of spy at the very least give it to sylvester stallone who give a semblance of a performance last year we all took on a cause a body that wa percent white percent male and an average of year old failed to nominate a single person of color for the most prestigious and important award in entertainment for the first time in almost two decade this year they did n't nominate a single person of color for the first time since last year worse there wa a sense of dread among those in the industry leading up this morning 's nomination in anticipation of the whitest oscar ever since last year crap they whispered those blogger are about to lay into u yes yes they are because they ca n't be bothered to lay into themselves they failed to nominate elba they failed to nominate straight outta compton for best picture the film about the rap group nwa that wa widely considered by reviewer and moviegoer alike one of the best made film of the year it did well at precursor ceremony that are supposed to predict such thing like the pga award and the sag award but not the white washed oscar no the oscar did n't it give the predicted best picture nod it deserved straight outta compton ha an percent rating on rotten tomato that 's not a high a selma which had a score last year when it became the beacon of snubbed diversity but it wa the film that wa ruled the contender for people of color this year because apparently they only get one straight outta compton wa better reviewed than the revenant the most nominated film this year it rotten tomato score wa an capped off by a mid screening snooze by yours truly this movie wa ridiculously long but more importantly i guess it wa considered the one film the one film anyone who care about diversity get it 's been a year in cinema where tangerine rotten tomato score changed the conversation about what filmmaking is and humanized one of the most topical issue of our time but why nominate that when there 's a spielberg film about a war to sleepily check off on your ballot it 's been a year when a black filmmaker and a black actor revitalized one of cinema 's most hallowed franchise with creed rotten tomato score and screened to standing ovation for audience and reviewer alike that 's nice let 's give the one white guy involved an oscar nod ryan coolger and michael b jordan are oscar nominee in my heart it 's been a year when samuel l jackson who wa only in the past week passed a the highest grossing actor of all time gave the performance of his career in the hateful eight but failed to pas the test for actor who get campaigned for a tarantino film that test is are you white jennifer jason leigh passed with flying color it 's been a year when bryan cranston and will smith both did silly accent in best picture contender but only of them had a serious push for an oscar nomination because he wa in a movie about important thing like white movie writer who have been mistreated and not important thing like african doctor attempting to change the world 's mind about the value of an entertainment institution that could possibly be killing people ha no not the oscar the nfl but good guess this is to say that there wa arguably a plethora of movie that were made by and featured people of color and their story this year but they were not for whatever reason deemed campaignable or oscar worthy and if they were it wa only in the service on ensuring that there wa n't another white washed nomination list that could be picked apart by outraged internet writer like me it 's infuriating that for the second year in a row the organization with the power to challenge society to be a catalyst for at best forward thinking or at the very least wisking u off to a different world one that make u contemplate our own doe n't deem a story involving a person of color worthy especially when film that did all those thing and nonchalantly featured people of color were worthy why doe the revenant or trumbo or bridge of spy or mad max fury road feature into an award conversation when beast of nation straight outta compton tangerine or will smith doe n't look at the face of the people on screen and then at the people voting for them it 's simple last year 's selma 's snub wa probably more egregious than the lack of nomination for any of those film though i 'll argue that the fact that none of those film were campaigned a hard a their white counterpart to be institutionalized racism in it own sort but the fact that those snub last year kindled such cultural fire about the lack of diversity in the academy and the tangible repercussion for omitting recognition for story about people of color and then this year we repeated the mistake is inexcusable but it 's not the only thing we need to work on not one of the best picture nominee wa made by a woman female filmmaker in the midst of a conversation about equal pay equal opportunity and equal recognition were snubbed entirely maybe there wa n't an oscar worthy film by a female filmmaker but maybe there also wa n't an opportunity to make one following a trend that began last year the best actress and best supporting actress race featured performance that were in film that were n't deemed good enough for best picture only saoirse ronan for brooklyn brie larson for room and rachel mcadams for spotlight can say that they are acting nominee for film that are also among the best of the year twice a many male nominee and every directing nominee can the message here do n't invest in movie that have woman in power role or that tell their story the academy of motion picture art and science the body that vote for the oscar each year is headed by president cheryl boone isaac isaac is a black woman she is a black woman fronting a historically racist and sexist organization of course issacs 's involvement with the award should n't serve a a mandate or even provide an expectation that the body she governs reward diverse talent no that should be on u we should be the one not tolerating this that shame the old white male organization that ha the power to mint the kind of cultural touchstone that can change society our thinking and at least make u think we should be the one who roll our eye at conversation about progress and change when one emmy award happens to reward people of color'we did it everyone give yourselves pat on the back 'but the academy award continues to limit the conversation to story about the white male experience that confuses the existence of the singular shonda rhimes for actual change maybe no film this year starring or made by people of color or by a woman deserved serious oscar consideration maybe this is truly the best slate of nominee but that 's an issue in and of itself the story that are being told and the people who are being allowed to tell them is too limited if that 's the case this not even starting the conversation about carol a film that received orgasmic review by critic scored two acting nomination and wa otherwise ignored and robbed for a best picture nomination should we be surprised that the award group that gave crash best picture instead of brokeback mountain and only reward film about the queer experience when it 's a straight actor bravely and daringly playing gay hi eddie redmayne cate blanchett and rooney mara probably not is the right answer piece about snub this year may mention idris elba maybe straight outta compton they 'll talk about helen mirren being passed over for trumbo pixar 's dwindling influence no good dinosaur and a veteran ridley scott being passed over in best director for exciting new talent like room 's lenny abrahamson new talent how novel funnily enough this year chris rock is the host of this year 's oscar there ha n't been a person of color hosting since'the last time chris rock hosted that wa more than year ago in that year jamie foxx won for ray and morgan freeman won for million dollar baby don cheadle catalina sandino moreno sophie okonedo and foxx a second time were nominee it wa one of the most diverse oscar ever and kicked off a decade ostensibly committed to the cause of normalization and opportunity in film'two word we see all the time when talking about this golden age of television it could n't be more glaring that nothing ha changed,110128.0

young parent that traveled from alabama for their month old daughter 's reconstructive windpipe surgery wa a heart wrenching one one with a tragic ending while his child recovers from a successful surgery wesley lander sits in jail his wife year old mary ann lander is dead from a reported heroin overdose a a recovering heroin addict with child of my own i wondered how could this have happened the fact are shocking even to a seasoned veteran of addiction like myself the mother found dead the father extracted from the bathroom a gun in his pocket and a needle still in his arm fatefully revived with naloxone the lander 's family photo on facebook and gofundme reveal little of a battle with heroin but parent who abuse opioids lead a shadowy existence where any knowledge of their substance abuse could lead to loss of their child exposure of child to illegal drug activity is also addressed in state ' criminal statute a a former heroin user i am continually grateful my child were born long after my active addiction in my search for parent with dependence on opioids i wa shocked when close to individual contacted me in le than hour they 're addict with child child of addict 'functional user and those who recovered along the way to parenthood all wished to remain anonymous and name have been changed throughout 'i 've really wanted to talk about this for quite a long time one told me he repeatedly mentioned that he had never spoken about addiction with anyone else another wa a father who lost his child due to heroin use 'it 's awful he wrote 'they are my whole world in fact they are probably the only reason i 'm still alive because i want to be in their life 'i can relate to the cincinnati story he said 'when my daughter wa born i had to stay well by using heroin for the two day we were in the hospital after she wa born and i wa on methadone when my son wa born he said he recently 'made the decision to tell my parent everything ' and hopefully gain full custody for the time being until i can get my life together there wa a common thread among the parent i talked to a man who used the alias john batt summed it up to me by writing 'we have a problem that doe n't mean we love our child any le we want the best for our child and we want them to be better than we are we teach them right and wrong we 're just like you imperfect addict parent are not unique in their struggle the national institute of health nih estimate that over million american currently abuse opioids and the national survey on drug use and health nsduh reported million child live with a parent who is dependent on or abuse illicit drug in case where help is requested system are frequently unprepared to meet the need of family system where substance abuse is an issue many family like the lander fly under the radar autumn lee is a single mother raising a toddler and a seven year old 'i 've been familiar with opiate for almost five year now from occasional use for the first year or so to ' now iv heroin she told me ' i stopped for about a year and now i 'm back to using anywhere from three to seven day a week after an incident where autumn 's child ended up at the hospital for a spiking fever 'her father had come for u with drug for me when we got home i went ahead and did some i felt lousy for doing it even though my daughter wa deemed healthy it made me feel guilty and pretty selfish that i wa willingly detaching myself from the situation nothing bad came from my dose and my stressful night morning had come to an end i 'm not telling you this because the situation wa caused by my using but that i chose it to cope in asking what she feel make her different from other parent autumn said 'along with the normal parental struggle i need to make it possible to be well while i probably should be spending that money on the kid it 's spent on myself'though my girl never go without so to speak they always come first just like i would go without food for them to eat i would never place them behind my own wellness or wellbeing they 're happy healthy smart little lady and that will always be my primary concern'just like any other parent autumn told me that she 'gets up at am to get my oldest ready for school some of the time she will get a ride but for the most part i walk her to and from school after that we do homework dinner movie entertainment bath bed i know that all sound redundant but that 's my day john batt wrote that my wife had been in pain management for some serious issue with her back when she started it wa legitimate and abusing the prescription really wa n't a thought to u but that soon changed thing escalated for the couple over time 'as with most pain management i assume the prescription were low he said 'however over time the quantity and dosage increased for about the last year she wa prescribed mg oxycodones along with fentanyl patch and some other medication we thought we hit the lottery and that there wa no way we would ever run out again but a is the story what would last u a month became three week then two and by the end we somehow managed to go through that in a week during this time we would supplement with heroin eventually the prescription stopped altogether and we were solely using heroin we 've been using heroin via iv for about two year now'we did n't even realize we were addicted until it wa too late john 's story echoed autumn 's 'we are like any other parent we help our child with their homework we play and color we hug and dance we teach and discipline a addict we have a much love in heart for our child a a clean parent the difference come with the lack of the drug 'once we 're well again everything go back to normal john wrote child welfare expert would disagree according to a report pdf on child welfare and substance abuse being raised by a drug dependent parent lead to poor cognitive delayed social and emotional development depression anxiety and other mental health symptom physical health issue and substance use problem for the child user argue that the stigma surrounding their use creates many of these problem unable to reach out for support for fear of losing their child parent with opioid dependence are frequently pushed into isolation where they can not access resource that are widely available for parent 'i think the stigma associated with abuse is abhorrent in general autumn told me 'yes there are some very sad case but a drug doe n't necessarily dictate your parenting just because someone ha vice doe n't make them a bad person or parent'just like being clean wo n't guarantee a good one there ha been much speculation in the a to why the young parent overdosed in the bathroom at the hospital the consensus seems to be that a user from out of state they would have been unfamiliar with potency of the drug available in cincinnati in addition the area surrounding cincinnati ha been plagued by heroin tainted with fentanyl pdf whatever the case using in unfamiliar surroundings could have exacerbated their problem leading to the fatal overdose wesley lander remains in jail on numerous charge and only time will tell if he be

posted wednesday night anderson vehemently rebuts the idea that her office wa ideologically predisposed to punish the pro lifer 'anyone who pay attention know that i 'm pro life anderson said 'i believe abortion is wrong but my personal belief doe not relieve me of my obligation to follow the law daleiden and merritt activist from the center for medical progress who have long alleged that planned parenthood illegally profited from the practice of fetal tissue donation have both been indicted on second degree felony charge for tampering with a governmental record based on their use of fake driver 's license while posing a representative of a biomedical research company daleiden ha received an additional misdemeanor charge for soliciting human organ since the indictment a planned parenthood lawyer ha said that daleiden sent an e mail to the organization in june asking to buy fetal tissue for even though anderson 's belief do n't align with planned parenthood she told doubter in her wednesday video statement that the grand jury had to follow the evidence 'the inconvenient truth of a criminal investigation is that it doe n't always lead where you want to go the harris county grand jury cleared planned parenthood of any wrongdoing so far none of the many state level investigation into the organization sparked by daleiden 's undercover video campaign have turned up evidence of criminal behavior that ha n't stopped the tinfoil hat from coming out in force to protest this first criminal indictment of the anti abortion activist first outlet like the anti abortion

decision making 'that is simply not true she said 'in august the day after our lieutenant governor asked me to investigate the allegation of misconduct by planned parenthood this prosecutor notified me of her affiliation with this organization indeed last august anderson announced to the press ' reeder will not be involved in any manner in this investigation if at any time in the future reliable

minor who have used fake id to buy alcohol but the law 's the law anderson reminded them 'the defense attorney also said today that the 'tampering with a governmental record ' case should not have

showing off one 's impressive body to your many adoring fan through social medium and for female celebs no physical asset is drawing more attention than the as case in point emily ratajkowski of

white checked bikini bottom the pic of what the mirror gushingly described a a 'majorly toned rear even managed to steal the thunder from ratajkowski 's valorized breast and 'sent instagram into meltdown according to ok magazine but ratajkowski 's ability to send social medium into a tizzy with a nearly bare shot of her rear ha a long precedence that is a testament to the as 's magnetic and sometimes dark power throughout history and yes that is a history that go back well before kim kardashian 'broke the internet with her shiny derriere on the cover of paper magazine'which in conjunction with nicki minaj 's booty centric 'anaconda led my colleague kevin fallon to declare the 'year of the butt certainly the as admiration cannon extends back in the annals pun intended of western culture before sir mix a lot declared he could not lie about his passion for big butt and sir mix a lot doe not stand alone in his buttock fixation though it doe not and ha not always stemmed from the fact that 'when a girl walk in with an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face you get sprung century even millennium of depicting glorifying and valorizing the butt through art and culture have been fueled by much more than sexualization something about the butt ha deeply fascinated western society for better and sometimes for worse the rear ha a certain quality to be both erotic yet playful one of the sexiest part of the body yet also one most often utilized a comedy fodder even the word 'butt 'bum and 'ass elicit laugh in a way 'boobs 'tits or the many slang term for male and female genitalia do not at the same time if one trace the depiction of the female as throughout history it 's clear that sexual more and racial stereotype have also long surrounded the obsession with the butt rachel kousser a professor of art history at city university of new york cuny 's graduate center explained to the daily beast that while the greek and roman were comfortable with depiction of nudity it wa the male nude who wa more often 'eroticized while female were nude 'usually in narrative scene when they were about to get raped or injured that changed with the revered praxiteles ' sculpture aphrodite of cnidus which kousser called the 'first valorized female nude viewer could take in aphrodite from all angle including her as karen leader an assistant professor of art history at florida atlantic university told the daily beast that she suspect the butt may have been le taboo in antiquity because simply put both lady and gent have them 'if i think of representation of woman from behind they are usually le sexual because a woman 's body and a man 's are not that different from behind'whereas a female nude from the front is obviously female the female nude from behind by it nature is le sexual in traditional history it doe n't invite the same kind of sexual response of course that 's presuming the viewer is a heterosexual man with his 'male gaze 'if you imagine that for most of the history of art the presumed viewer is a man then a man looking at a female body see breast and a female crotch a sexual area because men do n't have them explained leader 'so it 's something they want and enjoy seeing in art a woman from behind is not overtly sexual that 's the reason leader think that butt have taken on a certain acceptable sexuality'dare we say a cheekiness 'from behind there 's something just a little more chaste and i think it 's not that different from a man 's body she said 'very often the female nude in the history of western art ha had some little attempt to cover up a bit said anne eaton a professor of philosophy and art history at the university of illinois at chicago she cited the pudica gesture a pose of a woman trying to cover her breast and genitals'but not her bottom 'you see that pose all the way through italian renaissance period ' there 's an attempt to cover yet reveal this idealization of a woman being both erotic yet chaste in covering the front but flaunting or mostly flaunting her rear speaks to a larger double standard that still applies today said eaton 'there 's a really deep tension that run all the way through western art and pop culture between these two demand for woman it 's the 'lady in the street but a freak in the bedroom ' phenomenon noted eaton 'she ca n't be a chaste prude but she 's got to have some modicum of modesty eaton pointed out that many of our popular brand today play on what she called a 'deep sexual double standard 'that 's victoria 's secret she said 'they 're hardly wearing anything they 're not naked because a little covering is sexy'and that is because modesty is a virtue for woman just a a flirty flash of butt can be considered a sufficiently modest expression of female sexuality showing too much or having too large an as ha an ugly history of stereotype about dangerously excessively sexual women'especially woman of color 'the idea that woman of color have bigger behind and are also more highly sexual is an age old stereotype and a really vile one said leader one of the most obsessed over female behind wa that of saartjie

activist identified a greg pound wa speaking monday in front of the florida house criminal justice subcommittee expressing his support for hb that bill would make abortion completely illegal in florida except when pregnancy threatens a woman 's life or interferes with the treatment of an 'already life threatening disease 'and only then if two physician 'certify in writing that this is the case the bill would also remove the stipulation that abortion is permitted in order to 'avert a serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function claiming that this exception for a woman 's health 'impedes the state 's protection of viable unborn human life the net effect abortion would be illegal for any woman who would not die from pregnancy or childbirth the proposed legislation would also slap anyone who performs an abortion or operates an abortion clinic with a first degree felony charge which could carry a prison sentence of up to year a the miami herald report the patently unconstitutional bill easily cleared the subcommittee by an vote the supreme court ha repeatedly ruled that state can not place an 'undue burden on woman seeking an abortion before fetal viability let alone try to ban it entirely at every stage but for one christian lawmaker'and apparently a racist activist with too much time on his hands'the supreme court 's

implement blatantly unconstitutional abortion ban after roe v wade most recently north dakota passed a 'fetal heartbeat law in that wa intended to ban abortion after six week it wa blocked in federal

candidate not overly noxious to the full range of libertarian sensibility pollster at zogby gallup and pew find larger percentage of libertarian based on response to question about the role of government in promoting moral regulating the economy and providing basic good and service in any given national election the libertarian vote is enough to swing thing in one direction or another that may also hold true in various republican primary too and for all his reactionary position cruz doe approach libertarian sensibility in some meaningful way he 's in favor of strong second amendment right and among the gop hopeful he is second only to rand paul on ending bulk collection of metadata and reining in the surveillance state he ha been outspoken against idiotic and environmentally destructive corn based ethanol mandate a position that surprisingly ha n't hurt him in iowa and cruz say that he is a strong federalist meaning that most political decision should be pushed down to the most local and theoretically representative level possible among federal state and local government this is why he talk about having the definition of marriage decided by the state rather than the federal government of course had the supreme court ruled differently last year on the matter one assumes cruz would be ok with that too because he rarely miss an opportunity to invoke 'traditional marriage that 's the main problem with federalism in the end it is always result driven and depending on what a particular person want in a given situation he will always claim an exemption to a general rule just ask the democrat during the contested election when they reversed everything their party stood for and insisted that no really the florida vote wa a state issue and ask the republican who insisted that no really the fate of terri schiavo wa a pressing concern for the federal government the state 's right position cruz typically take are not libertarian david boaz told me in a recent interview 'a firm federalist would push for the repeal of federal drug law said boaz the executive vice president of the cato institute and author of last year 's the libertarian mind 'cruz doe n't do that cruz also belief the federal government should govern abortion which make you wonder why he think gay marriage should be left up to the state that said there 's overlap on some issue that might provide common ground between cruz and libertarian cruz ha recently 'evolved on marijuana and after attacking president obama for failing to enforce federal law in colorado and washington now say he 's open to the state experimenting with legalized pot boaz rightly observed to me that cruz turn off libertarian 'with his heavy emphasis on evangelical issue such a gay marriage and abortion the apocalyptic extremity of his rhetoric is off putting even beyond it content and there 's a strong case that cruz ha blown up any possible of rapprochment with libertarian voter but he'and the rest of the gop field a welly'would do well to start courting libertarian if they 're serious about driving all the way to the hoop in the campaign whoever becomes the republican nominee is in luck for he will almost certainly face hillary clinton a candidate a repugnant on virtually every level a the current crop of republican on the other hand there 's a reason why most current candidate are dead even with her in hypothetical matchup and it 's not because the gop is insufficiently hateful toward gay syrian refugee and ebola patient the percent'or more'of the electorate that reliably trend libertarian and have shown a willingness to vote republican in the past are out there but it wo n't vote gop unless they believe the party is serious not about praying and making sand glow but about reducing the size and scope of government that may be too much to ask for even and especially from a candidate and party that is constantly talking about smaller government but it 's hard to see many libertarian pulling the lever for anybody who only talk the talk,16634.0

n't even live in the united state ten month before election day member of the u k based gambling site betfair have spent over million betting on the outcome of the u s 's primary and general election it 's a market where vice president joe biden who swore off a presidential run in october currently ha better odds to win the presidency than chris christie or martin o'malley on some site that accept bid on the election elizabeth warren al gore and michael bloomberg currently have a far better shot at the presidency than a to bet on ben carson the republican polling at percent in iowa according to gambler betting market are more accurate than poll for predicting election a majority of betfair user correctly predicted the winner of the and general election after the race were reduced to two candidate whereas poll fluctuate by week by location or by polling agency betting market tend to exhibit more stable trend but this election cycle ha thrown even the most statistically minded gambler for a loop today a dollar bet on a donald trump primary victory will turn a profit of on betfair his odds are ranked the best of any gop candidate on the site trump 's share price to win the entire election reached it all time high wednesday on predictit a site that allows user to trade future on candidate ' chance trump 's price sits tied with bernie sander for second place at cent and cent behind leader hillary clinton at cent per share at press time trump hold a cent lead over marco rubio for the republican nomination trump is now surging on the site up cent week over week and cent on wednesday alone but while trump 's poll number have charted sky high since his summer campaign launch the betting market have been slow to invest earlier this summer a dollar bet on trump would earn a return of nearly on betfair while first jeb bush then marco rubio led a the betting man 's favorite 'for or week in a row we saw jeb bush ahead then rubio pulled ahead of him around december st trading on the site went up significantly and recently trump pulled ahead said predictit spokesperson brandi travis 'it say that people did n't really think he would get the nomination until around now according to prediction market expert these late in the game lead change reflect unusual volatility in the betting market one that suggests a deeper divide in gop politics 'i think that what 's different about this year is that you have people with strong but incompatible opinion say rajiv sethi a professor at barnard college who ha published a study on pattern in political betting market 'there are people who have felt people who have publicly expressed the view that trump could n't possibly be the nominee they felt very strongly about that and very comfortable betting against that outcome and really that view ha started to change the rise of trump in the prediction market ha been driven by the breakdown of the narrative that he could n't possibly win for a market that pride itself on objectivity political gambling ha tripped over the same judgement a television host that something would inevitably lead to donald trump 's downfall be it his attack on immigrant his criticism of john mccain 's war record his anti islam rhetoric or that he once tried and failed to sell 'extremely greasy frozen steak at the sharper image david rothschild an economist who run prediction tracking site predictwise say the betting market finally came to term with trump at the beginning of the new year 'you really see this kind of crossing sometime around january where trump started to really shoot up rothschild say according to predictit 's internal data trump and sander both moved into nd and rd place respectively right around christmas trump ha enjoyed a consistent lead over ted cruz for the gop nod since january th rothschild link trump 's upshot to his comeback after a brief polling drop in iowa 'in the polling for a little bit i think people saw it a 'it 's finally going to happen ' the first time he lost after leading something'but then he bounced back in the poll in iowa and continued to hold firm in new hampshire he said 'i think in many sens it 's just a matter of time slipping away trump 's new acceptance in betting market also indicates a trend towards a broader acceptance of anti establishment republican candidate rothschild belief he classifies the gop race a not one election but two 'semifinal battle between establishment candidate like jeb bush and marco rubio and anti establishment candidate like trump and ted cruz 'you saw a sense of stability in the sense that a jeb bush went down and rubio went up they kind of traded off that weight he say of earlier betting market 'and similarly you 'll see now that a trump ha held on firm in the last few week against cruz 's charge you see them kind of trade off support in the market overall you see the market tend to give incrementally more weight to the non establishment a the candidate have progressed into the year a time dwindles in the primary competition a bet against trump is becoming a true gamble and even those who believe he will fail in the general election where betfair value hillary clinton at overwhelming odds would rather bet on trump than risk on rubio but for those looking to predict the next president sethi caution that reading the betting market can be a 'chicken and egg situation 'we do n't know yet whether the price moved first or the change in public perception of the race he say 'it 's an interesting question but will take some time and careful empirical work to answer it 's worth noting that these site skew towards a particular kind of person an internet savvy gambler with some money to spare and an interest in national politics 'we skew heavily male with most of our user between the age of and their late s said predictit 's travis according to data sent to the daily beast from predictit of the site 's trades'or percent'were made by user between the age of and over of those trade came from user in either new york or california even with it homogenous userbase travis say predictit is a much better indicator than one might think it is after all the only u s based online prediction market since intrade 's shutdown in and since real money is on the line travis say she 's learned user are more likely to bet with their wallet than with their heart 'i talk to the trader who show up to predictit event and they say 'there 's no way i would ever vote for say hillary clinton but that 's who i would put my money on ' she said and the number back that up a university of iowa study concluded that prediction market are ' percent closer to the actual outcome than polling and the result get even more accurate day out from a vote 'it 's what you think is going to happen said travis 'not what you want,10152.0

miniseries about bernie madoff one could n't help but hope the enraged comedian might portray the world 's most devious ponzi schemer ala that part went to seasoned actor richard dreyfus while black ha taken on the role of ezra merkin also known a 'the rabbi who managed to avoid jail time despite funnelling billion of dollar to madoff the madoff series come smack dab in the middle of a busy run for black who stood out a the short tempered anger in pixar 's oscar nominated inside out last year and is currently performing on a national stand up tour in which fan are encouraged to submit their own video rant for him to play onstage at the end of each show on top of all that black expects to return to the daily show for one of his classic 'back in black segment next month though even he doe n't know what he will be ranting about this time despite all the change on that show over the past year black remains it longest serving contributor'he made his daily show debut year ago when it wa still being hosted by craig kilborn when the daily beast spoke to black last year he had some very positive thing to say about bernie sander with the iowa caucus around the corner we caught up with him again ahead of the madoff premiere on february below is an edited and condensed version of our conversation what can you tell u about the character you play in the new mini series about bernie madoff i play one of the prick i 'm the guy who delivers elie wiesel and his money to bernie so he 's a sweetheart and how did you approach playing that character i wa just more of a prick than i normally am laugh no i did n't have that kind of part i wish i did have that kind of a part but i got to wear a yarmulke which is always a treat i had n't done that in year so i could feel truly pious and like a prick you 've joked in your stand up act about how the bernie madoff saga is stranger than fiction and too good to be true given his last name what make this story such a perfect encapsulation of american greed how do i put this the triumph of self confidence if i appear to be if i look like if i 'm confident if i 'm more confident than the guy in front of me ' but it 's also the whole concept we have of acquisition at this point it used to be keeping up with the jones when i wa a kid now it 's like keeping up with the military industrial complex 'boy i hope i 'm doing better than a third world country what level of madness is this donald trump 's run for the presidency is in a way of the same cloth 'i 'm so confident you do n't even know what to do with me i 'm that confident you see similarity between trump and madoff i 'm not going to go there because then he 'll go 'i saw this thing in the daily beast this son of a bitch lewis black ' but what i do see is the idea that there 's something inherently important about making money to certain people more important than it is to other people who have other value a a friend of mine said you do n't see trump 's name on a hospital or a college i believe you 've just done one 'back in black appearance on the daily show since jon stewart left how do you think trevor noah is doing so far i think it 's a hell of a task i think he 's doing a well a can be expected it 'll just take time it 's like i love what stephen colbert is doing on cbs stephen who is already a seasoned professional is having to overcome his other show the colbert report and i think he 's certainly moving it in that direction it 's just going to take trevor that kind of time it 's a huge transition he ha to find his voice and the show ha to find it voice in the end it 's going to end up being based on his point of view and his sensibility well there is certainly plenty of material to work with in the race which of the candidate is infuriating you the most these day the one that i found most astonishing is ben carson how doe ben carson become a legitimate candidate i just do n't understand it i literally do n't understand it at all 'i wa doing surgery one day and i thought gee you know i could be president what what i 've learned from him is that if you speak softly in a reasonable tone and you close your eye so that they 're just a third open much like a lizard you might see baking in the sun you can say any batshit crazy thing you want and people will find it reasonable apparently well it 's really extraordinary stuff will come out of his mouth and you just have to say 'no that 's it you 're done in the same fashion republican can talk about it and do all their rigamarole and jump up and down but they 're the one who wanted trump you made the pact with the devil when you let trump run the republican party did not behave like adult in term of the tea party and now they 're getting ted cruz running a a result and then trump wa going to bring eyeball and a soon a trump said what he had to say about mexican that should have been it who allows someone to run for the titular head of your party after he come up with a comment that is basically for all intent and purpose let 's say percent racist and then it take them thing later to be like 'now you crossed the line he seems to be testing the water too because this past week he said he could go in the middle of th avenue and shoot someone and he would n't lose any support i wish he would shoot me if he 's going to shoot someone get rid of me if he 's going to win my real take on it is what we see with trump is what we saw initially with palin and then trump and palin together what we saw is precisely the intersection of reality and satire i ca n't be funnier a a comic than what 's going on year ago i 'd say 'michael jackson and the audience would laugh now my opening act go 'donald trump and get a huge laugh i come on later and go 'donald trump and it get a huge laugh it 's all you have to say a of now the gop side ha turned into a battle of donald trump v ted cruz which of them do you think would be worse for the country they both would bring a certain amount of baggage i think they 're equally bad for the country in their own special way which do you think ha a better chance of becoming president at this point i would say trump every time we come back to this point in time every four year somehow iowa and new hampshire become the center of the universe and somehow i do n't really buy that i do n't think ethanol is the most important thing on earth right now we 'll see what happens but to me it 's skewing the election this time and the other thing is the candidate did n't help people always go you 're a democrat i 'm really not i just do n't like them i am a bernie sander supporter and it 's only because it 's the first time i 've ever had a candidate i 'm a socialist i finally have a candidate and he 's not going to win why because he said he 's a socialist but are you surprised to see him out polling hillary clinton in iowa and new hampshire no because it 's just fatigue with her she 's been in front of u for so long it 's like watching my parent who are married forever my parent have been married seventy year i do n't think they hear a word each other ha ever said after a point you do n't hear it the same thing occurs with the president by the time obama took office we 'd already seen him too much they are in our face it 's ludicrous nobody can survive that except apparently kim kardashian you memorably portrayed anger last year in pixar 's inside out which is nominated for best animated feature will you be attending the oscar no i think if we had been nominated for best picture we might have but they told me at least that the cast doe n't get invited that may change but i think the chance are slim what do you make of the boycott by will and jada pinkett smith i can understand why they want to boycott it i also think what really need to be done is to look at the voter most of whom are older and white the boycott will help if nothing else what the boycott did wa get these idiot and the press to finally pay attention to who 's voting this ha gone on for a while i do n't know if straight outta compton deserved a best picture nomination i do know that there are certain movie that i 've seen that i think should have been nominated before this year that never got nominated in term of black themed motion picture but what else is fucking new did mad max get a nomination yeah for best picture and a bunch of other award see that 's the one to me that is really beyond my comprehension i really think that is the most senseless nomination i 've seen in quite some time it wa what you call a chase film it wa like an old western 'they 're coming after u we 're gon na get to this next town and once we get there oh no now we 've got ta go back what kind of a fucking'it wa like watching that game where you try to run to the base without someone tagging you what the fuck kind of a movie is that you compare that to straight outta compton and that 's the one you nominate some people are calling for chris rock to pull out a host assuming that doe n't happen what are you hoping to hear from him i think he could n't be in a better position i think his being in that position is a strong a a boycott for him it 's stronger because he can go after it because of how fucking funny he is,27246.0

begin if you want to explain the hilarious incredibly dense subversive comic book universe that is the long running adult swim cartoon the venture bros the simple answer is this the show started out a a parody of jonny quest the ' s cartoon about a boy adventurer and his super scientist dad but the venture bros explores a world where there are actual real world repercussion to a childhood that wa spent battling costumed villain and all manner of super powered being with plan for world domination many of which saw kidnapping him a a mean to that end a you 'd expect dr thaddeus 'rusty venture ha grown up to become a pill popping seething cauldron of insecurity and neurosis resentful of his far more successful father and wholly unable to get over the fact that he peaked in celebrity and promise a a year old he ha n't 'invented much of anything that is n't a rehashing of his dad 's now obsolete s gadget and he 's not even a real doctor clinging to an honorary degree to cover for the fact that he never graduated from college in his desperate pathetic attempt to live up to the life that wa both thrust upon him and promised to him the familial history is repeating itself this time a comedy his two son hank and dean are emotionally stunted hardy boy ish goof isolated on dr venture 's sprawling compound homeschooled and socially inept way too eager to leap into the next battle against dr venture 's many antagonist granted said antagonist are just a flawed bungled human being a dr venture himself and their grand plan to 'destroy him are revealed to be an empty game filled with melodramatic sound and fury sans any desire to actually do harm a the monarch dr venture 's archenemy say after breaking into his lab 'what can i do to this guy that life ha n't already i almost feel sorry for him the larger answer to what the venture bros is it 's a show about failure not just dr venture 's personal failure but also the failure of the ' s jet age to live up to it promise 'it 's me voicing my disappointment that we do n't have that kind of magic going on any more that level of enthusiasm and hope creator jackson publick said in a reason interview 'that extends to the kind of cultural stuff that wa going on in the ' s a youthful generation thinking they could change the world i 'm voicing my displeasure at having been born in a time when some of that magic for lack of a better word is gone and some of those promise that were made in all of our pop culture were never met my laptop is the coolest thing that 's come out of that i 'm still waiting on my jet pack a writer producer doc hammer added in the dvd commentary to the season one episode 'home insecurity failure is the thread that tie all the character together 'it 's about that failure happens to all of u he said 'every character is not only flawed but suck at what they do and is beautiful at it and jackson publick and i suck at what we do and we try to be beautiful at it and failure is how you get by it show that failure 's funny and it 's beautiful and it 's life and it 's okay and it 's all we can write because we are big failure that might scan a bleak or morose but i guarantee you the venture bros is a comedy'and a hilarious one at that'while simultaneously containing a world a complex and intertwined a the marvel comic universe or any serial drama on television today take this scene from the season premiere 'hostile makeover spoiler alert hank venture is ziplining from the top floor of venture industry ' new baxter building like mega headquarters to save a young woman that he belief

ensuing rage and desire for revenge against the force of darkness drove him to become the night dick hank 's reaction a barely stifled giggle it 's a brilliantly surreal action packed beautifully shot scene and publick and hammer simultaneously punctuate and deflate all it puffy overblown cinematic glory with an inspired bit of juvenile silliness a dick joke in a post credit scene just to drive the gag home a he 's exiting alongside star and garter a lingerie clad captain america the night dick glumly complains that 'he laughed at the name and for all the heroic derring do everyone involved failed hank did n't save the damsel in distress and the night dick i 'm still giggling loses all of his tough guy bravura openly mocked by the teen he just rescued granted getting the full belly laugh doe require a knowledge of the entirety of the sprawling mythology that publick and hammer have created that can be daunting given the immensely detailed intertwined history the character share to get a sense of the massive size and scope of what we 're talking about here this eight minute recap of the first four season should get you started the supersized episode 'all this and gargantua served in large part to clear the deck or at least prune a few extraneous narrative thread though only one character wa killed off it set the stage for the venture clan to move to new york after doc inherited his far more successful brother 's fortune it 's not exactly a reboot but in term of the overall arc we 're higher up on a spiral at the same point in term of latitude and longitude but with the entire weight of the show 's history still lingering underneath i spoke with publick and hammer by phone and they said 'that 's an incredibly accurate way to put it would these change mean that we 'd finally get to see doc succeed 'i 'm not sure how much of a success inheriting your dead brother '' money is hammer said 'that might be considered a blip in some macabre way but i would n't call it a success 'i think it 's a 'success ' at least on the level that it doe put a new spring in his step and you 'll see this season it doe make him kind of evaluate his priority publick said 'but if you look at the psychological benefit of succeeding he would n't have any of those because everything came to him through a will so i think he 's the same kind of scared jackass 'it 's like falling in love again hammer added 'where you 're like 'oh my life 's so much better and so much different ' you 're really the same asshole you just have another person that doe n't know what an asshole you are yet this season is a little like falling in love again i mentioned a note they had received from an adult swim executive after the first season that the show wa 'too nerdy too any objective viewer far from taking the note it seems a if they 've doubled down 'when we double down on something it 's with a purpose'to illustrate the value said publick 'that wa probably at the beginning before he realized what this show really wa and what culture we 're preaching to you know hammer continued which yes the geeky superhero and sci fi obsessed world that the venture bros both satirizes and adores wa still very much seen a a subculture when the show first premiered in it 's not just that seemingly every single movie being made is part of the marvel star war and or batman axis it 's that the way a devoted fanboy will interact with and consume culture ha become the norm there is no popular entertainment product without a dedicated following ready to pore over and debate every single character and plotline to the nth degree in a sense we 're all henchman and delving deep into how the smurfs reproduce in the midst of a crisis for hammer and publick that can present a problem in and of itself 'we were just doing this and it seems like the world ha kind of jumped on board hammer said 'it got a little farther than i thought i mean it 's very difficult now to make a show when you know that everything we show somebody can make a screencap of a downloaded high definition version of the show and pore over it we have to look over every still of the show knowing somebody 's going to look at it with these eye of making it canon it 's difficult it make me wish i wa writing a fucking flintstone episode where it doe n't matter hammer doe take great pleasure in 'poring over the detail and i do like going 'oh this is going to be on the screen for two second i 'm going to make it the most beautiful thing in the fucking world but now i feel like i have to ' then again 'who would n't love to write a flintstone episode that 's what i 'm saying he said of course the flintstone never gave two of their male character breast or allowed hank to spend multiple episode gallivanting around in an iron man ish super powered exoskeleton that wa made for a woman 'when you first want to experiment with drag the best way to do it is to be invulnerable hammer explained 'yeah a fucking gender conquistador publick chimed in i asked if the notion of the comic book geek fanboy world a largely a woman free domain is what led to the show 's examination of gender issue after all the stereotypical notion still exists that if these dork would just put down their darned funny book maybe they 'd get laid or at least be able to speak to a potential sexual partner without turning into a quivering pile of emotional goo 'you 're answering your own question actually hammer said 'we are playing inside of a world that ha always been this kind of young male dominated thing so when you 're playing around in that and stretching thing to their ultimate and quasi realistic end that 's where you 're going to get your gender issue 'nobody on this show seems to have a mommy publick added 'and just like the way child think or old male oriented action wa set up all woman were either just a creature you ob over that you ca n't have or they 're the dragon queen who 's trying to destroy you 'yeah they 're untouchable or they 're the femme fatale said hammer 'it seems like we 're starting to slip more woman into the world and maybe that 's because they 're in new york now and because also nerddom ha changed 'we are kind of adapting sort of subconsciously a our character start to mature a little and a the culture around these kind of genre and stuff change also our stock and trade is commenting and playing with nerd comic book culture a it change we do given that publick and hammer write and direct each and every episode on their own in addition to providing the voice for many of the character there 's often a long wait between season it 's been two and a half year since the end of season five but that degree of creative control is part and parcel of their process one that start with 'throwing a bunch of shit up on the board and kind of loosely discussing the major thrust or the bigger arc that we want to make sure we hit and then you know we 've just got a handful of dumb premise and it 's just a matter of which one of u latch on to one of them sometimes character have sprung from writerly challenge 'we have a long history of writing down our worst idea and then daring one of them to do it and then getting something kind of good out of it hammer said one such example is dr henry killinger an otherworldly mary poppins slash villain whisperer who sound and look like the former secretary of state and carry a 'magic murder bag said brainstorming session also lead to one liner about jacob riis when dean briefly move to new york in 'bright light dean city he snag the only apartment he can afford'a crappy sro when dr venture check out his son 's new pad he quip 'are you waiting for jacob riis to take your picture it 's not just showy erudition there 's a reason behind the sea of reference both high and lowbrow that pepper the show 's rapid fire quip tastic dialogue 'we learned a long time ago and maybe it wa a bad thing for u to learn that no matter what joke we make somebody will get it publick said 'the little joke are really for these people that are never going to have a joke about their life on television ever again hammer said 'when we mention stiv bators in an episode there 's a small group of people going 'wow my childhood ha resonance i thought that i wa completely alone in the world ' it 's a big joke to not that many people

the comparison is closer to the devotion of fan in storied baseball franchise like the new york yankee and boston red sox than it is to pro football in most nfl city where the atmosphere of a college football game can be imitated but never duplicated in august the wall street journal ran a misguided story titled 'at alabama fan are getting a little bored with all the winning the writer ben cohen argued that 'amid all this prolonged dominance there are sign that boredom if not downright apathy ha started to creep in cohen cited an item from the school newspaper which reported that perhaps percent of student football ticket went unused by student in i 'll wager my autographed kenny stabler football card that cohen never attended an alabama game or he would have found that the reason so many student do n't use their ticket is because they can sell them for the kind of money that could put you on the yard line when the new york giant play the new york jet alabama 's football team is a rising tide which lift all boat a the new york time put it last fall 'alabama 's football pre eminence on television and in the postseason along with an aggressive plan to extend the university reach beyond the state ha helped attract a more academically minded student body in the past decade from all over the country and served a the catalyst for more than billion in fund raising according to those who have engineered the explosive growth the result is that over the decade alabama ha surpassed notre dame a college football 's national brand the fighting irish have n't been number one since since then alabama ha topped the final poll four time including a victory over notre dame three year ago in the title game for many year the only area where alabama could n't top the irish wa in the popularity poll known a the heisman trophy vote during the th century notre dame had winner to alabama 's none not even joe namath the number one pick in the draft who lost out in the voting to notre dame 's john huarte who ended up playing just game in the pro 'alabama never had a heisman trophy winner wrote dan jenkins in his classic book on college football saturday 's america 'because they never needed one under bear bryant and the men he learned the game from it wa always the philosophy to share the ball other team got the heisman alabama got the national championship trophy now alabama get both ingram became the first tide player to win the award a college football 's outstanding player in the year alabama won it first national title under coach nick saban this year the heisman went to running back derrick henry who had gained yard and touchdown against a schedule estimated by usa today 's power rating expert jeff sagarin a the toughest in the nation henry finished the year with yard and tds that schedule by the way is one of the thing that hone alabama 's dynamo and keep it fine tuned year after year the tide play in the southeastern conference far and away the college game 's toughest football league and saban regularly schedule at least one ranked outside opponent at the beginning of the season in order to test his player this past season alabama 's opponent when not playing alabama won of regular and postseason game far and away the toughest competition of any team in the country another factor is a recruiting program that not only haul in the most talent from the football rich territory of the southeast but blue chippers from the rest of the country a well this process began about half a century ago when the greatest of all college coach paul 'bear bryant began raising the crimson tide from the level of regional to national power by reaching out to rural pennsylvania and grabbing the hottest quarterback in the college draft joe namath prior to that bryant 's favorite kind of football player wa a he famously put it 'guys who are n't very talented but do n't know it now the program attracts top flight nfl bait such a green bay packer running back eddie lacy new england patriot linebacker dont'a hightower and atlanta falconswide receiver julio jones and put them through the same rigorous training under nick saban a in bear bryant 's day alabama wa probably one of the leading football school in the nation from the time it team journeyed north to play northeastern behemoth such a penn and fordham in the s and s but without national television and a national press following them few knew it then in a rising young abc executive named roone arledge came up with the idea that college football could become a staple of network programming it wa arledge who transformed the college game from an occasional entertainment into an autumn saturday afternoon american tradition the first college game arledge produced wa the opener of the season between alabama and georgia in birmingham the crimson tide had already won a trophy room full of award from rose bowl and sugar bowl along with a few national title but marked the first time the tide had ever been featured on national television once fan all over america got a good look at alabama cheerleader heard the million dollar band blaring 'yeah alabama and saw the craggy outline of bear bryant outlined against a blue gray september sky it became a habit to tune in alabama game every fall tex noel former executive director of the intercollegiate football research association say 'since alabama ha had the most successful program in the country measured by a combination of victory strength of competition and bowl appearance perhaps though the most significant reason why alabama is the most influential football program of all time is the one offered by bear bryant himself 'when we have a good team at alabama i know it 's because we have boy who have good mama and papa the sophisticated are ill advised to sneer at this prescription for winning it could well be the main reason why on monday night alabama is a point favorite to win it th national championship ' a they say in tuscaloosa and counting,5413.0

exhibited total biblical illiteracy and had a many wife a an old testament patriarch but none of that matter when the billionaire mogul spoke at liberty university this morning he got a rapturous welcome that showed just how much evangelicals love him'and why the obsequiously warm reception he received may upend conventional wisdom about what conservative christian want from their presidential candidate and that 's great news for trump fox news morning programming warmed up the strong crowd and then the university 's hipster christian worship band led student in song 'we worship you today because you 're the great celebrity in this place prayed david nasser the school 's senior vice president for spiritual development addressing god the boisterous crowd'some of whom woke up at a m to get good seats'proceeded to worship trump trump 's performance certainly drew some sneer especially when an attempt to pander fell flat after trump mispronounced a biblical reference a 'two corinthian instead of 'second corinthian but despite that his overwhelmingly warm reception confirms that he 's just a competitive a any other republican among evangelical christian voter this wa not always obvious many conservative christian power broker including penny nance of concerned woman for america and russell moore of the southern baptist convention have harshly criticized trump and his call for barring muslim from immigrating to the u s worried many conservative christian who prioritize issue of religious freedom but that doe n't matter jerry falwell jr the university president and son of moral majority founder jerry falwell introduced trump to the crowd and left no doubt about his feeling for the golden haired mogul 'in my opinion donald trump life a life of loving and helping others a jesus taught in the great commandment he said then he compared trump to reagan 'my father wa criticized in the early 's for supporting ronald reagan over jimmy carter for president i should say because ronald reagan wa a hollywood actor who had been divorced and remarried and jimmy carter wa a southern baptist sunday school teacher falwell said 'my father proudly replied that jesus pointed out that we are all sinner every one of u 'jimmy carter wa a great sunday school teacher falwell added 'but look what happened to our nation with him in the presidency the implication wa clear a a bell evangelical christian should n't stress about trump 's personal life but falwell did n't just compare trump to reagan he also said trump reminded him of his father generous and pragmatic and he compared trump 's presidential campaign to the university itself 'i 'm proud that liberty is now strong enough financially to refuse gift if they come with objectionable condition he said 'and it is clear to me that donald trump is the only candidate in this national election to make that same claim he can not be bought he is not a puppet on a string like many other candidate the crowd erupted in cheer 'he is not a puppet on a string like many other candidate who have wealthy donor a their puppet master he continued essentially indicting the entire rest of the republican field the trump liberty love is a mutual one after sauntering on stage to sustained applause trump announced that the turnout at the event wa a new record for a liberty university convocation perhaps unaware that student attendance at these weekly meeting is mandatory and said he would dedicate the impressive feat to martin luther king jr seriously a spokeswoman for the university said people attended the event and did not confirm if trump actually broke a record or what the previous record wa trump said that being compared to jerry falwell the elder wa 'really an honor for me then he reiterated his promise that department store will say merry christmas if he becomes president christian love that you know 'i have friend that are n't christian he noted 'they like to say merry christmas they love it everybody love it he also noted that he is a big fan of the bible saying it is the only book to top the art of the deal 'everybody read the art of the deal he said 'who ha read the art of the deal in this room everybody i always say a deep deep second to the bible 'the bible blow it away he added 'there 's nothing like the bible he spent the bulk of the speech talking about iran isi and the sad mendacity of the national medium 'twenty five percent are good two percent are great said sad national medium he argued ha failed to report on just how support trump ha won 'you 're not getting a real picture of the silent majority which jerry sr had something to do he said 'and that 's a phrase you should be really cognizant of because it is a silent majority but i think i 'm gon na up it a little bit because it 's no longer so silent it 's really a noisy majority trump wa n't especially articulate there but the appeal wa clear his success is n't a fluke rather the implication wa that trump 's supporter come from a long tradition of grassroots conservative who seek to use the political process to change cultural norm see christmas war on and trump 's pitch wa perfect 'he spoke to the liberty audience and culture almost a if he wa a part of it said johnnie moore former senior vice president at the school 'as if he had been a part of it ' a graduate or an alumnus or someone who had had kid go there moore said that 's because despite his 'two corinthian flub he came off a authentic 'not a single person in that crowd this morning thought i wonder if he 's lying to me moore said he noted that evangelical christian have two basic approach to politics some want candidate to have a much in common with them a possible they embrace long shot contender like mike huckabee and rick santorum because they share their identical conviction about christianity 's role in public life the falwells are n't in that school of thought rather they like winner even if that mean backing candidate who used to be pro choice and have a few divorce under their belt that 's why jerry falwell sr made good with john mccain after the arizonan called him an 'agent of intolerance and it 's why their family wa so undyingly loyal to the bush even a george h w bush struggled to win evangelical support the falwell family ha n't lost it single minded interest in winning and that 's why jerry jr had such kind word for trump 'it wa clear that he would be extremely comfortable if trump wa the candidate moore said this should surprise no one in a few month before obama 's re election trump spoke at the university for the first time jerry jr praised his most controversial stance in an affectionate introduction 'in after failed attempt by senator john mccain and hillary clinton mr trump singlehandedly forced president obama to release his birth certificate falwell said dead serious and the student roared that year trump 's speech that year wa a little bawdier he encouraged student to get prenups 'i wo n't say it here because you people do n't get divorced right nobody get divorced ok so i will not say have a prenuptial agreement to anybody in this room and he stirred controversy by telling them to 'get even with people who wrong them luke definitely is n't trump 's favorite bible verse despite that jerry falwell jr practically begged him to run 'it 's not too late to get back in the presidential race is it falwell said after that speech and now trump is in and falwell seems to love it this put him a bit at odds with other evangelical leader a coterie of conservative christian influencers secretly agreed last month to coalesce behind ted cruz a national review reported but falwell is hedging cruz who announced his presidential campaign last year in the same room where trump spoke might be more faithful than trump and he might not have been married a bunch of time and he might have that neat harvard law degree but that doe n't necessarily make him a winner student at the school shared falwell 's energy for the candidate five bros wore shirt that spelled out the word trump'one letter per t shirt and spent the time before the event posing for photo and fielding medium question others woke up early to get front row seat for the mogul 's speech christian malave a student at the university said he like trump 's attitude 'he just think about everyone before himself he said 'and yet he ha the most money in the world sophomore emma jerore and freshman mary madison goforth said they were in line for the speech by a m so they could get good seat 'he 's a very wise businessman goforth said jerore said she is trying to pick between rubio and trump goforth said she faced the same dilemma 'today definitely motivated me a little more towards trump 's side she said 'we both got to shake his hand so that wa i mean enough in itself she added a number of student said they were trying to decide between trump and cruz brian teague a sophomore studying aviation who sported a trump t shirt said carson lost support when news broke in early december that he doe n't believe in hell 'a lot of people were leaning towards him because he wa so humble you know his moral teague said 'but when he left the idea of hell i think that 's when he lost a lot of people that said liberty is n't all trumpkins caleb fitzpatrick a freshman from tampa fla said he think the billionaire is the worst republican candidate 'i think he ha no idea what 's going on in the world he said 'i think he 's arrogant i think he 's a narcissist i think he 's perverted still student gave trump an adoring welcome if trump want to build a new moral majority he 'll know where to find footsoldiers,27789.0

215,9662504.0,2016-01-06T05:01:00+00:00,ted cruz 's dad the gop 's new mythical hero,dallas rafael cruz ha biography that seems made of red state american dream fleeing cuba coming to the united state becoming a born again christian falling hard for reagan and now trying to help his son ted inspire an evangelical resurgence in american politics it 's a compelling narrative and it make for a great tea party rally speech cruz wa his son 's most beloved surrogate during the texas senate race and the admiration he found from tea party crowd only grew but a rafael cruz 's star ha risen so have a multitude of myth about his life that team cruz doe n't exactly discourage like for example the one about how cruz is a freedom fighter from a 'hellhole who stood up against communism turned dallas based pastor with his very own church so while rafael himself and the cruz campaign have n't to our knowledge publicly said anything inaccurate about his personal history they have left uncorrected some tale that member of the medium and prominent conservative activist have woven about cruz the elder including tale that are totally divorced from reality and in some case easily found on the internet there 's rafael the man a fascinating and influential person in his own right and there 's rafael the myth an odd duck who fought communism and pastor a church outside of dallas it 's unclear where the rafael cruz mythology came from and how much they benefit his standing in the evangelical community but it 's clear that the myth are pernicious and that they 're impactful one of the first and most galling falsehood about rafael cruz 's past is the notion that he fought communism he did n't but that ha n't stopped some of his most vocal backer from repeating in contravention of all fact that he suffered under communism and took on fidel castro in fact glenn beck one of rafael cruz 's biggest fan argues a much in the forward to rafael cruz 's own book 'a time for action empowering the faithful to reclaim america released just this week published by worldnetdaily of 'long form birth certificate please fame ' w hen rafael cruz told his teenage son about the torture the fighting the oppression the murder and the communist hellhole he grew up in ' there 's no doubt that imagery shook his young son to the core and burned an unforgettable image and feeling that would never ever go away beck wrote cuba may have been a hellhole when rafael cruz wa growing up there but there 's one thing it wa n't communist a andy kroll detailed in his national journal profile of rafael cruz the future senator 's father fought against the island nation 's dictator general fulgencio batista and at one point the general 's force captured and tortured him 'behind every great man is an even greater father beck add 'and let it be stated for the record unequivocally rafael cruz is one of the greatest freedom fighter of his generation in reality the batista regime gave rafael cruz a student visa in which he used to travel to the u s two year later in castro became prime minister of cuba and the island nation became a communist country and when it come to literal fighting in armed conflict rafael cruz fought on only one side fidel 's but this false implication that he wa on the other side of history still find it way into the first page of his very own book this is n't the only instance of cruz world overlooking misperceptions about cruz the elder 's cuban background in when ted cruz wa running for senate there wa a controversy over whether the senator had perpetuated the myth that his father left cuba after castro took power the dallas morning news determined that then candidate cruz had never made that particular false assertion but they still criticized the candidate 'cruz though ha remained silent a journalist and political activist incorrectly placed his father among the many cuban who left the island nation after castro took power rather than a someone who fought on the same side a castro to topple a rightist dictator though he departed for texas before the revolution succeeded the paper wrote that report note that kelly shackleford who introduced cruz to the value voter summit said his family fled castro 's regime and cruz did n't correct him but that 's not the only persistent rumor multiple major publication have reported rafael cruz that he pastor a church in the suburb of dallas except that he ha n't ever rick tyler a spokesman for cruz 's campaign told the daily beast that these report are all wrong and that rafael cruz ha never pastored any church he is an ordained minister tyler said but ha never led a congregation instead tyler said cruz 's ministry focus on preaching sermon to group of pastor and that he wa ordained through a program based in texas called minesterios mundo de fe still story in major outlet ran saying cruz 'is a pastor at a baptist church in suburban dallas or that he wa 'raised catholic he became born again and is now a pastor at a dallas church even religion news service made the same statement on sept 'now rafael pastor a church in dallas and directs the purifying fire ministry ministering in the u s mexico and central america and campaign for ted among pastor the outlet reported they were hardly alone the incorrect assertion wa also part of a bio of rafael cruz for a family leadership summit where he spoke 'today rafael cruz is a pastor at a church in dallas and serf a the director of purifying fire ministry ministering in the u s mexico and central america said an information page about the event ralph holland who head mundo de fe emailed that his ministry ordained cruz 'rafael ha travelled to our network church in latin america and ha been very effective in his ministry holland wrote 'he is often solicited in the church i have personally accompanied him on many of those trip and witnessed firsthand his effectiveness holland added that cruz is 'very theologically versed any relation to 'purifying fire ministry by the way is another cruz mythology tyler said cruz initially branded his work preaching to pastor ' group with that moniker but ditched it when he realized that suzanne hinn wife of famous and sketchy televangelist benny hinn had a ministry with almost the identical name it 's an odd situation and if his son 's rise continues at the rate it 's going it could generate no dearth of confusion for people looking for the truth about the dad of the maybe president,11410.0
585,9907156.0,2016-01-13T20:05:00+00:00,the gop 's civil war get even more fun,'vice president nikki haley blared the blunt headline on eric erickson 's paean to the south carolina governor after her tuesday night state of the union response erickson is not a donald bro to put it mildly so haley 's obvious swipe that the gop front runner sent him over the moon and he 's not entirely wrong to write 'then there wa nikki haley she hit it out of the park it wa one of the best response to a state of the union address ever and the absolute best since barack obama 's election she showed humor passion and a willingness to hold the president accountable she went so far a to admit republican had to share blame with the president but presented how the gop would fix problem it helped create then there were those who uh disagreed most famous of course wa ann coulter 's tweet about how president trump should deport her a breitbart com article noted grumpily that the republican seemed to be using their little moment in the sotu sun to be bashing republicans'and not just the frontrunner but rank and file voter too 'according to rasmussen of conservative voter say the united state should not let in any refugee from the entire middle east ' the point of view republican leadership is presumably attacking with it state of the union rebuttal and there 's more we have laura ingraham who took the dan snyder esque all cap approach 'not smart and breitbart columnist john nolte who tweeted 'to the glee of our corrupt medium nikki haley is attacking our own frontrunner the gop establishment is garbage this is just five kind of awesome is n't it it 's yet more proof that the gop could actually break in two which will open the door to haley 's defender desperate to beat back nominee trump rushing to someone like'well like who is the problem but they 'll be desperate enough to find somebody now from what i can see'and i admit i can only read so much of this stuff'erickson seems to represent the majority view on what we might call the broad right and haley obviously did do a fine job last night and she 'd be a plausible a vice presidential choice a a lot of people especially assuming the democrat stick with hillary clinton but now that i think about it for which of the gop candidate would it make sense to pluck haley their birther battle aside cruz still want trump 's voter if the donald collapse somewhere along the way which mean it 's not an obvious choice for him marco rubio so the gop ticket would then have two nonwhite candidate and two southerner but it 's the two nonwhites that seems problematic to me and no i 'm not saying that because i think conservative are a bunch of racist i 'm saying it because percent of the general election electorate is still white so the only remotely plausible candidate jeb is no longer this who might choose haley it seems to me is chris christie currently trading at the long odds you 'd expect but what 's most interesting here is the haley narrative over the year and the us to which conservative have put her a needed she burst on the scene you 'll recall in she wa behind and kind of a 'who and wa going to lose to gresham barrett a congressman and citadel grad and everything a south carolina republican gubernatorial candidate wa supposed to be when bam sarah palin endorsed haley and everything flipped overnight barrett left the race something of a broken man which i chronicled back in suddenly post palin it wa new face of the gop a sikh of all interesting thing it helped that most american could n't tell you one thing about what a sikh wa just a long a it wa n't arab but yes she 's brown'but she 's conservative so she 's one of ours then she actually became governor although not by much'just four point in a heavily republican state there were glowing profile for a little while then a fairly major corruption scandal that nobody remembers a thing about anymore involving charge that haley screwed over the port of charleston in favor of the port of savannah in neighboring georgia because some crony donor of her stood to benefit down in savannah specifically she raised at a georgia fund raiser just day before her government lent it approval to the dredging of the savannah harbor for much of her first term her approval rating wa in the s but she weathered it and won reelection handily and she ha governed quite conservatively here 's her ideology score a determined by a site called insidegov com she 's to the right of new mexico 's susana martinez and florida 's rick scott and right up there with alabama 's robert bentley and she 's well to the right of chris christie just go to insidegov and plug in all their name and you 'll see plus she did the normal republican governor thing of screwing constituent out of health coverage by refusing to accept the medicaid expansion so everything wa basically fine with her on the right and then the charleston church shooting happened here fate grabbed her by the lapel and yes she did do the right thing when she ordered the confederate flag removed from the state capitol ground she even said it never should have been there in the first place she had a little support on the right for that one especially under the circumstance with the blood of those slain african american still spattered on the wall of a historic church but there wa also ton of blowback 'is the american flag next bayed one fox nincompoop said rush limbaugh 'it 's not going to stop with the confederate flag because it 's not about the confederate flag it is about destroying the south a a political force it 's about isolating targeting and identifying the south a dylann roof we have yet to hear from palin on haley 's sotu response she 's in a bit of a pickle or would be if anyone actually cared anymore what she thought but she 's spoken nicey nicey about trump in recent month now she ha haley whom she helped create attacking him where doe she go come to think of it what palin say on this one may in fact be instructive and the fact that what sarah palin say is indicative of anything say exactly what need to be said about the state of the gop,49810.0

learned wa mandarin chinese say hager 'so when i wa deployed to the middle east obviously i wa n't necessarily using that language but there were other system that i could run but all the languages'arabic farsi urdu pashto all those languages'we 'd be doing mission ' intercepting communication to warn people on the ground transcribing translating that sort of thing hager is hesitant about being more specific about what he did while deployed saying much of his day to day action are still classified because the air force us highly sensitive technology to pick up the ground based cell phone signal and short range radio that militant group such a the taliban may use to communicate but he did support american troop in iraq and afghanistan training his team to collect the electronic signal of the enemy translating and transcribing them and then sending the intelligence back to headquarters to be acted upon after six year however hager decided it wa time for a change

mineral used in smartphones that it border on slavery titled this is what we die for the report trace the cobalt from lithium battery that apple sony and other company use in their device to unregulated mine in the drc the page account build on earlier report that miner in this region risk abuse and death to make just day mining cobalt but on top of hazardous unethical work condition it expose an overlooked fact about the miner themselves at least of them are child if tech company are making billion churning out better and faster smartphones they may be doing it on the back of african kid to conduct the report amnesty'in partnership with african resource watch afrewatch 'visited five separate mining site in the southern portion of the drc from april may the country with a population of at least million is one of the poorest in the world in the world bank ranked it second to last on the human development index but if there is one thing that 's plentiful in the drc it 's cobalt expert estimate that more than half of the world 's supply come from that one country alone with percent of it from what are called 'artisanal mine for congolese who are able to tolerate the work it is plentiful'however it seems rarely if ever a choice the vast majority of the miner that the researcher interviewed said it wa the only job available one said they had to do in order to eat those whose child were working said they could n't afford to send them to school a handful that wa able to send their kid to school had to ask their child to work on the weekend artisanal mine where most work are smaller independent mine where an industrial sized operation is not an option without a large corporation behind it artisanal mine are somewhat of a free fall they are not a part of the country 's mining code and regulation meaning they are often unauthorized and extremely dangerous a a result the worker are subjected to dangerous condition that include poor ventilation lack of protective gear and frequent accidents'many of which prove deadly but it 's not just adult that are risking their life of the almost mine worker the organization interviewed of them were child working in high temperature rain and storm amnesty found kid a young a seven carrying sack of mineral ore heavier than themselves many suffered from breathing problem others from sickness and disease at least half reported being beaten for not working fast enough none it seemed had a way out one former worker loic reported severe back pain from the grueling work he did beginning at age nine a year old told

bone deformity respiratory issue and musculoskeletal injury most complained of excruciating back and hip pain others of chronic illness but beyond physical risk are le visible danger chronic exposure to cobalt can be fatal resulting in a condition called 'hard metal lung disease despite the prevalence of study confirming this amnesty found no evidence of protective equipment at the mines'no glove mask or even work clothes the worker had never been provided safety equipment nor given direction on what to do in a crisis without any sort of armor against the hazardous condition death is common while amnesty could not find an official death toll an independent radio station in the drc report at least five to six accident a month'some of which kill dozen at a time according to their report miner died in a fire near kasulo on december on september more were killed after a tunnel collapsed in mabaya many miner told them that the number are much higher but that many of the body due to the

chris wallace ha managed to excavate the host of fox news sunday'who apparently equaled megyn kelly per trump in the 'blood pouring out of his eye department for grilling the reality show billionaire about his business failure during the now legendary august debate'will get a second chance in the ring on thursday when he and his colleague kelly and bret baier moderate the final republican presidential gabfest before the feb iowa caucus 'you 're only human you do n't enjoy that wallace tell the daily beast about his fractious encounter with various political figure 'on the other hand if you 're going to be in this game this is hardball you 're going to be throwing tough question at them and you have to be ready to take tough answer notably wallace confronted an infuriated former president bill clinton who during a riveting september skirmish over his failure to take out osama bin laden hectored wallace 'you got that little smirk on your face you think you 're so clever then there wa gop presidential candidate newt gingrich who during an august debate in iowa accused wallace of 'playing mickey mouse game and even incited the crowd of to boo him after wallace asked the former speaker of the house 'how do you respond to people who say that your campaign ha been a mess so far the night after the cleveland debate in august trump phoned in to cnn anchor don lemon 's program'the one on which the candidate made his arguably misogynistic remark about 'blood coming out of her kelly 's wherever 'and did his best to demean the year old wallace with an invidious comparison to his famous father 'the great mike wallace wa a friend of mine trump told lemon referring to the minute star 'and the son is only a tiny fraction of mike believe me there 's a big difference between mike wallace and chris wallace because i watched him last night'you know blood pouring out of his eye too 'it 's not personal wallace say although trump 's invective sounded uncomfortably personal 'you understand that they 're doing it because they think they 'll win some support no politician ever got in trouble for attacking a reporter but doe it feel good not at the moment it 's happening wallace'who ha normalized relation with the republican frontrunner having conducted three sunday show interview with him since the great debate'is agnostic on whether trump 's repeated denial that he wa making a snide comment about kelly 's menstrual cycle denial that are widely disbelieved within fox news are to be credited 'i do n't have a clue he say 'i would n't ever presume to try to read donald trump 's mind wallace is more skeptical about trump 's insistence that in making fun of new york time reporter serge kovaleski during a campaign rally in south carolina he never intended to mock kovaleski 's physical disability a chronic condition called arthrogryposis which deforms and restricts the movement of his hand and arm 'i think that 's a harder one to deny wallace say alone among sunday show anchor to say nothing of almost everyone else on cable he ha steadfastly refused to allow trump to phone it in 'it wa n't so much that i enforced it but i wa shocked when the other show suddenly started doing phoner wallace say 'i had never heard of that to the best of my knowledge in the long history of sunday talk show i understand why some of my competitor did that you get a cheap quick rating hit by having donald trump on even if it 's a phoner but i think it kind of devalues the currency ' 'the sunday talk show is the place where you 're supposed to get in depth hard hitting well researched interview where you see the back and forth between the interviewer and the guest and you ca n't do that if you do n't know whether a politician is in his pajama or ha his talking point in front of him most of the heat surrounding the upcoming debate of course surround the medium 's expectation'make that hope'of firework between the republican frontrunner and fox news 's prime time star kelly since her brief on air statement month ago defending her debate question concerning trump 's sexist insult of woman she ha chosen not to respond to the candidate 's occasional swipes'and is perhaps the nation 's only television anchor who ha not interviewed the candidate since august over the weekend trump tweeted 'based on megynkelly 's conflict of interest and bias she should not be allowed to be a moderator of the next debate the network retorted 'megyn kelly ha no conflict of interest donald trump is just trying to build up the audience for thursday 's debate for which we thank him on monday night trump doubled down telling cnn 's wolf blitzer that he might even skip the debate if kelly participates'prompting fox news to respond that politician do n't get to pick which journalist question them and that of course kelly will be front and center the notion that a man who aspires to be commander in chief and leader of the free world would spend so much time and effort trash talking a television personality'or for that matter that a reality tv star would dominate a presidential nomination race'simply attests to the strange and unpredictable nature of the campaign trump 'has become quite an effective politician say wallace who ha been covering presidential campaign since and joined fox news in after a career at nbc and abc 'you can agree with him or not you can think he 's more of a showman than a serious statesman but the fact is in term of going out on the stump or running a campaign'he 's a very effective politician and i did n't quite appreciate that from the start wallace initially subscribed to the beltway conventional wisdom that trump wa at best a passing fancy but he began to see him a a credible contender after interviewing him in october 'i did n't appreciate his standing with a lot of the american public he say 'he really ha a very attractive brand for a lot of voter they see him a a tough guy a straight shooter somebody who'even though he 's a millionaire'kind of share their sense of frustration with politics a usual wallace say he 's 'just a shocked maybe even more shocked by the rise of vermont sen bernie sander a brooklyn accented democratic socialist'and a year old jewish guy to boot'who ha been giving hillary clinton fit in iowa and new hampshire 'i think it 's a testament to a couple of thing wallace say 'clinton is not the most galvanizing candidate we 've ever seen and i think the steady drumbeat of scandal involving the email and the clinton foundation have taken their toll and the same sense of frustration that 's propelling trump is also propelling sander 'as we saw in if people have a choice between change or experience unless they 're really happy'and they are n't right now'they going to choose change in the democratic campaign at this moment sander represents change and she represents experience wallace who back in the last century during the clinton administration wa close enough to the clinton ' trusted lawyer david kendall to share family vacation with him a friendship that apparently ha faded over time say hillary clinton a ubiquitous presence on the washington public affair show on the other network ha yet accept any of his weekly invitation to appear on fox news sunday 'i do n't know ask brooklyn he say referring to the location of clinton 's campaign headquarters when asked why he belief he 's been spurned especially since she wa happy to appear during the campaign against barack obama in contrast to fox news 's conservative reputation wallace is a registered democrat'a pragmatic choice he made so that his vote would count in the heavily democratic district of columbia where he life and pay tax that might come a a surprise to president obama and his minions'about whom wallace once remarked 'they are the biggest bunch of crybaby i have dealt with in my year in washington while obama continues to use fox news a a foil in speech and interview wallace say relation with the white house have measurably improved since he made his complaint in when then white house communication director anita dunn had declared a cold war on the cable channel 'they finally came to their sens and realized we are n't going anywhere he say noting that administration official regularly appear on his sunday show'most recently white house chief of staff denis mcdonough 'peace ha broken out still no other medium outlet ha the clout of fox when it come to republican politics and thursday 's debate is likely to have a huge impact on the race the last fox news debate attracted a record million viewers'multiples of the audience for such event in previous presidential election cycles'but wallace decline to predict whether thursday 's program will match or even exceed that eye popping rating 'this is very different from last august say wallace who ha been spending the past couple of week honing debate question with kelly and baier 'we get together and kind of mercilessly go over each other 's question he say 'last august wa the first time all of these candidate were on the stage so you were really kind of exploring where they on issue where potential conflict between those candidate on those issue were and now we 're right in the heat of the campaign'having a debate that will take place four day before the voting start in iowa unlike in august when an unwieldy group of candidate took the stage this one which air at p m will feature a more manageable six to eight candidate invited to participate based on an average of national and statewide poll the lineup of debaters'who will likely include trump ted cruz and marco rubio with probably jeb bush ben carson chris christie and john kasich in the mix'will be announced on tonight 's tuesday 's installment of baier 's p m news show special report 'to a certain degree you 're trying to be a consumer reporter here wallace say about the moderator 's job 'and

402,9787491.0,2016-01-10T05:15:00+00:00,how the whiskey industry is being hacked ',if you ask any major whiskey maker what their biggest problem is today every single one without exception will tell you they need more stock whiskey ha surged to be the number one spirit in term of annual revenue and is just a few year from outpacing vodka to be number on in volume a well but volume is hard for whiskey because the best product on the market is usually that which ha been aged longest in oak barrels'a process that take year it 's a problem people have been attempting to solve for year in a variety of industry dependent on oak barrel for aspect of their product'everything from wine and beer to vinegar joel paglione the grandson of a canadian winemaker of italian descent know this well he just funded a project on kickstarter that boast a product meant to impart all those oaky flavor associated with barrel aging in a fraction of the time oak bottle is a project built on the concept of surface area to volume ratio 'it 's a unit of measure used to gauge how quickly a vessel can oak infuse the liquid inside say paglione 'whether that 's an alcoholic liquid or whatever it is that you 're infusing joe recalled that his grandfather 's vineyard had used smaller barrel to increase the surface area while aging wine he applied the same concept to oak bottle 'i said let 's make the smallest possible vessel and that 's the bottle the oak bottle is also a fascinating innovation in it own right it 's a single piece of milled oak rather than a mixture of pre cut stave like you 'd see in a barrel that make for a more eye catching product in term of surface design but also creates a more consistent surface for liquid to interact with during aging a drastic improvement over the barrel if you consider leak and other defect caused by multiple piece of wood to be negative paglione is the first to do it in such a small vessel and he 's right that surface to volume ratio increase oak interaction he say he and other competitor in the field have created a category that he refers to a 'speed aging or spike aging it 's something that people have been playing with for decade to speed up the aging process or what they call the aging process but is actually oak infusion there are some process some chemical process but i do n't pretend to be an expert in this field oak bottle 's competitor on the market include a lot of other attempt to play with surface area from handful of oak chip and spiral of oak to miniature barrel and glass vessel with oak bottom it 's an industry with a lot of people trying different way to solve the same problem oak bottle is getting a lot of attention since the success of it kickstarter last year it 's been backordered for product and the growing demand ha given them the chance to add feature to the product like laser engraving but while it 's flying out of warehouse and satisfying customer it 's not necessarily the full answer to the problem of speeding up time for that you need to turn to bryan davis founder of lost spirit distillery 'people have been trying to figure out how to solve the barrel economics problem for a hundred year say davis whose company built a pharmaceutical grade reactor that solves the problem it 's always a bold step to call out your competition shortcoming but in his case he 's got the explanation to back the assertion 'the reason they generally fail he say 'has been that everybody keep looking for one silver bullet like this one thing that you do like 'we 're going to take wood and we 're going to increase the surface area or 'we 're going to take wood and we 're going to put it under pound of pressure davis say they 're not wrong just incomplete 'some of them have produced part of the profile of an actual aged product but none of them have ever produced the whole thing he explains 'and the biggest reason why is the process in nature is three or four main reaction but each of those reaction are affecting hundred of different molecule at the same time so the first thing is that it 's not one silver bullet it 's three or four and then it 's a bunch of tuning to get all of those lined up in the right pattern to be able to trigger a reaction davis 's reactor handle all of those process to the specification that you input in order to recreate the effect of aging on a particular alcoholic liquid and that 's a big accomplishment we did n't even know what those process are until davis did it he answered the question because like so many others the roadblock to making whiskey frustrated him 'i started distilling alcohol in high school because i could n't get a fake id davis explains that love of hooch continued into college before coming a legitimate business for a few year a davis moved to spain and opened an absinthe distillery after selling the property and returning to the u s davis decided to start a whiskey distillery until he saw the cost 'i do n't have million lying around and everybody who ha million lying around is n't keen to give it to me so instead he turned to the question which still needed answering despite a century of need 'the last time someone tried to comprehensively answer the question wa a paper by the u tax authority in it took him five year to answer it davis explains these process in a lot of detail and it 's clear he ha the knowledge to walk you through everything that happens in a barrel day by day for decades'listening to him describe them feel sort of like taking a biochemistry course at the graduate level what he get to in the explanation is a few bigger point there 's more going on than a simple oak contact reaction and that these thing happen at different time in multiple stage that 's bad news for people who are leaning on wood to get the job done because in wood those process occur naturally in real time so while you may increase surface area you 're not manipulating other process on the biological or chemical level just the space for them to happen to make them happen faster take help but davis think he 's figured out how to do year of those process in the right order effectively in eight day in fact lost spirit distillery already did it albeit with rum they released their first product last year having not fully solved the equation because one part of the process wa still giving them trouble they started with rum rum due to the constant warmth of the climate where it is made effectively did n't require that last puzzle piece they continued working on it though with bigger aspirations'namely whiskey 'it 's the pound gorilla say davis 'because everyone 's running out of stock no one ha enough to meet their demand since then they 've made progress 'we 've managed to get rye down we 're still tinkering with bourbon and we 've also done scotch in the lab quite successfully what is success according to davis it 's a copy or approximation of an existing product 'you go for similar it 's not impossible but it 's very very difficult to carbon copy a product he spends a lot of time working on 'legendary products'things that have been long out of production and are available in volume of maybe bottle in the world they do that fairly regularly it requires taking two sample and comparing those sample for standard deviation from there they essentially reverse the aging process to try and recreate the white unaged spirit a it might have appeared when it wa still made then they have to recreate that product from existing spirit which may take a blend of modern product before they even have the canvas to work on to add age davis elaborated a bit to explain the complexity of the next step 'so you can start aging it but once you start aging it you 've got to deal with 'okay well what kind of barrel were they using if they were pre used bourbon barrel then the bourbon would have stripped out a certain ratio of chemical from the wood so now we 've got to go make bourbon on the reactor using american oak and then take that leftover wood and put it into the aging process 'would they have been using missouri wood would they have been using virginia wood so now you 're running all those test and you 're also going 'are we sure they did n't throw some sherry cask in and if they did would those have been spanish oak sherry cask american oak sherry cask or french oak sherry cask and there are two different group of french oak'and if you did use some sherry barrel in there what kind of sherry like we said complex 'you sort of try to trial and error through it say davis 'to eventually match the chromatogram if i were to really aggressively say i 'm going to do this i could spend a year on it no problem he 's working on replicating more modern whiskey for existing client who want to capitalize on the lack of wait time the idea is that if you can make something pretty close to a year old scotch in eight day you can make quite a lot of profit blind test have been positive though they ca n't share many detail on the private project 'in my lab i can produce a liter a week which is not going to flood the market the actual production reactor of which there are two on the market they produce about gallon of cask strength a week that 's not a lot of product still but when they realize they need an extra gallon of some year old whiskey davis 's product can deliver it year month and week faster than anyone else davis say his larger customer are looking at it for augmentation and supplementation 'for the guy who are opening a new distillery and want to grow aggressively but are lacking those billion to fill the warehouse for those guy this present a really interesting opportunity because they can grow to their heart content so long a they have customer those reactor lease not sell currently for a price something like per bottle and another cent for wood and electricity 'you can pretty much say at a bottle you can turn it over 'the really cool thing though is that there 's no angel share that 's a really neat bonus perk because the angel 's share on a mature product is percent upscaling is the next great hurdle 'right now we 're working on research contract with pretty much all of the major to figure out how to do this for all of them he say 'so far we 've solved one sort of perfectly and then the rest of them we 're still working with we 're also building the reactor a fast a we can assemble them he 's been assembling these unit for six month so far he say they 're still extremely complicated and not terribly user friendly oh and they cost about to build 'they 're built by the top pharmaceutical reactor manufacturer our market for these is larger than the pharmaceutical industry 's demand for reactor but davis say you want that level of care because apparently a lot of the reaction 'take place very close to the point at which the thing explodes at the end of the day the big whiskey maker still have the advantage here since you 'll need wood and you 'll need alcohol and you 'll need the dollar machine but the entry point is much lower this way and requires fewer people for success and ironically it will get easier a time pass and davis 's product matures 'i think you might see of these operating in the next year he guess 'we 're limited by how many we can build but in a decade i mean who know,19579.0

to be his 'medicare for all program take center stage in a sander administration the candidate promise every man woman and child in america will share in a government run government funded health care system but the single payer system that sander is evangelizing is n't just a figment of progressive utopian fantasy single payer health care ha already been tried'and failed'in sander 's home state of vermont deciding why it failed in vermont is key to whether you buy into the candidate 's promise to extend the program nationwide according to critic from the new york time ' paul krugman to usa today 's editorial board sander 's single payer plan is something between a well intentioned fool 's errand and a political pipe dream an unrealistic idea that ha been proven not to work in the senator 's own backyard but closer to home activist say vermont 's failure even to implement it plan for universal health care wa a failing of political will not the policy itself in better hand they say the policy can still work to know the difference it 's important to understand how vermont got so close to single payer in the first place in the state 's democrat controlled legislature approved a government run government financed health care system for all vermonter the state 's new democratic governor peter shumlin signed the bill into law after campaigning on a pledge to enact single payer himself a cost estimate of the program known a green mountain care wa ordered but long delayed election came and went including shumlin 's own reelection which wa so close vermont law required the final decision to go to the legislature after shumlin failed to win a majority of the vote in november a the state waited for the legislature to take up the election result shumlin announced that he would not pursue single payer after all when the long awaited financial projection showed 'the promise and the peril of a single payer system the promise of course wa a chance to give nearly every vermonter reliable access to quality health care but the peril came in the cost for the program an estimated billion a year almost the size of the state 's entire billion budget to make up for the billion shortfall tax would have to go up a lot business would see an percent payroll tax increase on top of whatever they chose to provide for employee health care while individual income tax could jump by up to percent the report recommended against moving forward 'due to the economic shock and transition issue and shumlin agreed 'i wanted to fix this at the state level and i thought we could shumlin said but he called implementing single payer health care in 'unwise and untenable despite the ominous budget projection at the time single payer advocate now say shumlin 's decision wa purely political 'right up to the last gubernatorial election gov shumlin wa saying he wa going to do everything he could to make single payer health care a reality in the state that wa quite frankly why we did n't run a candidate against him said kelly mangan the executive director of the vermont progressive party 'almost immediately he turned around and said 'oh yeah we ca n't afford single payer health care it 's not going to happen mangan described single payer advocate today a 'fatigued and very disheartened a vermont 's state budget continues to be squeezed by medicaid cost she said the possibility of returning to the issue any time soon seems unlikely she also worry that vermont 's example will damage future prospect nationally 'i think it will have a ripple effect people will use it a an excuse to do nothing by saying 'if they could n't do it there then it ca n't be done ' she said dr gerald friedman an economics professor at uma amherst and a part time vermonter ha worked with sander to develop and calculate the cost of his plan and say the budget wa n't the problem for the vermont proposal the governor wa the problem 'on the economics it would have been cheaper but the governor just lost the political will friedman said but the professor acknowledged that any national health care proposal from sander would face the same political headwind that shumlin ran into 'it 's going to be a tough road and vermont is a lesson he said 'it 's unfortunate that it happened the way it did even with the vermont debacle in the rearview mirror and friedman 's own projection that the sander 's 'medicare for all would cost north of trillion over year the politics of single payer are still working for sander the latest kaiser poll showed percent of democrat favor a 'medicare for all proposal while percent of independent favor it too clinton ha dismissed sander 's proposal a unrealistic and a danger to the reform that have already been enacted through the affordable care act that argument seems to be falling flat in new hampshire where the latest wmur poll showed sander trouncing clinton by nearly point but at least clinton can count on some support

marquis de lafayette'a french aristocrat and a general in george washington 's army'in a strategy session with washington just before the battle of monmouth during the american revolution when sarah vowell went to see the monument a part of her research for lafayette in the somewhat united state she mention to a friend there that a character on one of the panel wa rumored to have been modeled on a young thomas edison he 's supposedly one of the soldier standing behind molly pitcher who brought water to the soldier and 'who wa either an actual woman named mary hay or a tall tale or the composite of a lot of actual woman including one named mary hay or not at different battle vowell writes after a discursion about molly pitcher'or mary hay or whoever'vowell note that none of the character depicted in the background particularly look like thomas edison vowell 's friend look up picture of edison on his phone 'by that i do not mean that he call up edison 's picture from the internet vowell writes 'he ha an edison portrait on his phone already in between snapshot of his kid which vowell explains lafayette in the somewhat united state is not a biography of lafayette or a history of the battle of monmouth or of the revolutionary war the underlying material of the book is closer to a history of lafayette 's two extended stay in the united states'first a the hunky elvis of the revolutionary period and many year later a the vega elvis on a valedictory tour of america in full on nostalgia for the good old day the book itself is sarah vowell 's exploration of all of this material and how she found it and what she made of it and why she 's writing about it it 's sort of a memoir about researching lafayette in the somewhat united state but only sort of if the book sound like an impenetrable mess then you misunderstand what 's happening here lafayette like vowell 's previous book is big sprawling discursive illuminating imminently readable and a bestseller we caught up with her to talk about the book her unusual approach to history and why she refers to antique lafayette memorabilia a 'merch were you looking for a topic when you found lafayette or did you find some other route into this material i wrote a short piece probably a decade ago about lafayette 's return trip to america in so he had been on my mind for a while the thing that drew me to that story initially wa n't the revolutionary war it wa lafayette coming back to the united state a an old man and the way the american people embraced him with whoop and holler he wa here for a year and almost every night there wa a party in his honor lafayette wa year old when he volunteered in the continental army so by he wa the last living general from the continental army it wa coming up on the th anniversary of the american revolution and his presence here whipped american people into this frenzy of affection we 're not a country known for our agreement or our mutual affection so those rosy aspect of his story appealed to me every other aspect of the story wa good old fashioned american rancor and inability to come to any kind of consensus he wa a lot younger than the people we consider to be his revolutionary contemporary part of lafayette 's appeal wa his youth i make an allusion in the book to young elvis and middle aged elvis lafayette wa this teenager in the american revolution and when he come back here he 's elderly there 's a certain fast forward rewind aspect to lafayette 's story he had trained with the french army and gone to riding school with future king he had more experience at than most of the people who were fighting with washington lafayette 's enthusiasm probably had something to do with his youth and some of his effectiveness wa bound up in a young boy 's quest for glory that seems somewhat ridiculous to me but the practical effect wa that'because he wanted fame and glory on the battlefield'he wa tireless on the battlefield meanwhile regular in washington 's army were deserting in drove you wrote a lot about how many more people came to see lafayette 's arrival in new york than when the beatles came to new york in that wa nostalgia for the founding father right yes that wa the first real nationwide iteration of patriotic nostalgia for the founder i wa a little kid during the bicentennial in and i remember what it wa like to be caught up in that part of it wa sentiment that washington the general the founder were mostly dead i think it wa also that wa the first time that american were going to have to elect a president who wa n't one of the founding father and it wa a very fractured campaign so some of it wa sentiment but some of it wa fear of now what you use a lot of contemporary language and analogy in the book'like calling lafayette memorabilia 'merch 'that you do n't see a lot in history writing i kind of feel like i 'm not eating my spinach i 'm alive right now so i write and talk like someone who is alive right now and some of it is rhythmic '' merch is just a stronger word and a stronger way to end a sentence than 'merchandise 'souvenirs seems too general 'merch ha the connotation of crass commercialism and it would be untrue to talk about lafayette 's return trip a a purely sentimental exercise people made a profit off of his image i 'm writing a a member of my culture trying to understand my culture when i mention someone live elvis people call that pop culture to me that 's just american culture it 's all just culture to me i do n't really make distinction i 'm probably actually le colloquial than i used to be i do n't think of it a colloquial a much part of the form of what you 're doing i 'm very aware a i read the book that most other popular historian operate from a conceit that they 're writing a cinematic novelization with real fact that 's not what you do which is more like a memoir of your inquiry into the material my book will never be turned into film probably because i do n't start out from a lofty place of expertise i do n't think cinematically my book are booky book and a lot of the detour and analysis are something that can only happen in a book i learn a i go and the reader learns with me a lot of what i do is analysis of what 's happening'like in the beginning when i 'm trying to set up the various theme of the book one of them is that american patriot could not have won the war without the help of the french government which wa the government of an absolute monarch the founding father were stickler about taxation in general but they were open minded about taking money from a french king who wa taxing his subject you could see that a a humorous aside but i 'm saying right up front that there 's a certain hypocrisy about that and i comment on it in a pretty blunt way my purpose is to be very clear and truthful about the situation accepting money from this government that 's way more punitive in the way it tax it people than the monarch of great britain wa really messy and doe n't lend itself to a two hour biopic a lot of that nostalgia wa for george washington in particular the founder are treated today with a certain amount of reference and for good reason'what they accomplished wa insurmountable and unprecedented'but they 're still people one of the thing i always come back to is this is a person george washington is a person the farther back you go people become almost like biblical figures'like someone who exists but in a mythic realm part of my book is about the slog of this war which last nearly year there wa a certain perseverance required of washington he threatens to quit at one point because there are conspiracy to get rid of him and the fact that he stick with it is one of the deciding factor of the war how did you figure that out that it wa ok to go your own way when other popular historians'nathaniel philbrick robert caro doris kearns goodwin'are writing what are essentially regarded a novel one thing i come back to a lot is that i had an incredibly protestant upbringing of the old time religion sort i wa brought up to believe that all human being are inherently depraved and evil but the democratic flipside of that is growing up believing that no one is better or worse than me it 's not a particularly cheerful way to grow up but in the long run it made me a more confident self contained person some of the way i write about history came from when i started writing the first time i wrote a distinct piece about an event in american history wa about the trail of tear for a radio documentary some of the book in the research were not pleasurable to read and reading ha been one of the joy of my life since i wa a little kid a lot of what i read wa n't clear or wa too simplistic i never found one version of that story that wa clear and sophisticated and fun to read some of the way i write now come from interacting with reader a lot of the detour that make my writing circuitous come from giving context there are tangent in the book where i 'm trying to explain what 's going on with the revolutionary war that come from reader telling me that they do n't read other history book maybe reader have n't considered that it wa n't just colonist v king sometimes it wa colonist v colonist the book is funny in a lot of place do you write somewhat a a humorist i like to think i 'm not a total drag my book are written by a person and people go through various emotional state humor is not my purpose it 's part of who i am but so is thinking about the management of the continental army 's supply system sometimes i joke around sometimes i 'm incredibly horrified sometimes i 'm thinking thing through sometimes i 'm telling a very anecdotal story sometimes i 'm making a point it 's just part of being a person i worked for a week once at the daily show i liked those people i like what they do and i admire it but everything wa supposed to be funny'which is the point of a comedy show on a comedy channel'but that wa just not appealing to me there 's some pretty dark stuff in american history it 's not all dark but a lot of it is some of the humor is just trying to deal with that darkness you had some people reading in the audiobook who are known for being funny but who do n't come across a hammy or ironic that wa on purpose right being a comedic actor requires a certain intelligence nick offerman is george washington who wa not a particularly funny person offerman'as a writer himself and a a person'has a certain gravitas he 's punctual he 's trustworthy he ha this authority and he 's also a wonderful actor having him read george washington wa a no brainer john hodgman ha an unwavering intelligence like john adam but also a hothead quality he 's good at being miffed some of these people are funny in their regular work but they have these other quality john slattery is a really good actor and he 's a hilarious person i like working on the audiobooks because you can see what people are capable of doing how did you put together the audiobook cast mostly it 's people i know from being around i have known fred armisen since i wa in school in chicago and he wa the drummer for some weird band he 's a fascinating person to work with before he read the part he writes a little play in his head of what the person is talking about he wa doing wilhelm von steuben the german general and to get himself into that character he wa talking in a german accent'like a german rocker talking about his day'and then he would do the scene to me the sleeper hit of the audiobook is alexis denisof who wa on buffy the vampire slayer he trained at the royal academy of dramatic art and did just about all of the british he did research on all the part and would say like 'this guy is from sussex and this is how they speak he came at it from this very scholarly shakespearean place what have you read this year i 've been on a japanese aesthetic kick i read a book that the architect arata isozaki wrote called japan ness in architecture i go on little research reading kick for my own enjoyment and i happen to enjoy japanese culture i also read detective novel there 's a writer named attica locke on the show empire who also writes great crime novel she wrote pleasantville which involves a dead girl and a political family in this traditionally black neighborhood in houston and i recently read the bloody bozeman by dorothy m johnson which is about montana during the civil war have you started on another project no i usually have kind of a mental hangover after i finish a book they read sort of breezily'at least i hope they do'but there 's a lot of information on every page corraling all of that into a structure really take a lot out of me,12143.0

audition for the role of special agent dana scully a medical doctor and fbi agent tasked with using hard science to disprove the alien conspiracy mumbo jumbo of her partner fox mulder david duchovny'then and known mostly for hosting showtime 's cheesy erotic drama red shoe diaries'charmed producer first 'he wa so intelligent and wry remembers danielle gelber fox 's former director of drama development he 'd already landed the role of mulder by the time he first read line with anderson in a hallway outside the office of fox network exec 'i have only a very vague memory of him i remember the hallway quite well anderson say phoning from los angeles the morning after the golden globe 'but i do n't know what i thought of him he wa very charming i do remember that she pause then remembers something else 'but i think he 'd just been charming to another girl right beforehand how very mulder i say a anderson break into guffaw 'yeah i think i went in a little bit wary of his charm anderson and duchovny 's legendarily potent onscreen pairing'rife with sexual tension yet ambiguous enough that a simple embrace could leave fan swooning for days'has been the object of heated obsession for decade ever since the x file a show that transformed serialized tv and elevated the potential of genre storytelling premiered in tale of alien abduction malicious government conspiracy shadowy figure and a plot to take over earth drove the series ' 'mythology arc in which mulder a believer and scully a skeptic hunted down the truth about what really happened to mulder 's missing little sister but it wa the unexpected magnetism between anderson and duchovny that truly gave the show it rabid appeal 'the chemistry wa there from the first day they ever appeared together in mulder 's office series creator chris carter tell me 'it wa not apparent until that first day that these two people were gon na click the chemistry you ca n't manufacture it wa just total luck the success of fox 's six episode x file event series which premiere with an episode written and directed by carter on sunday hinge in part on whether that chemistry'and the excitement and anguish of watching the agent clearly two half of a whole engage in the will they wo n't they dance'can be reignited again nine season two movie and year of x file history later at the time of her audition for the pilot anderson had but a few screen credit to her name'few enough that she did n't know what a 'mark wa she say or really how filming worked she cringes remembering her performance in the pilot 'i do n't knoooow if i handled it gracefully she say between self deprecating laughter her infectiously goofy laugh ha it own special place in x file history a a notorious instigator of crew wide giggle fit 'i just remember yelling at people a few time which i do n't normally do it wa pretty stressful back then the pressure wa humongous for the show it wa n't popular yet it wa costing a lot of money we were shooting ridiculous hour twenty four episode a season and there wa barely enough time to change clothes before having to get back to set to say another six paragraph of medical jargon it wa a lot by the show 's fourth season however anderson had struck gold taking home both an emmy and a golden globe for her work a the breathtakingly brilliant scientist scully had become a shoulder padded feminist icon at a time when few woman like her were lead character on tv she wa fearless complex and minced word for no one her story arc carried weight equal to mulder 's and despite her petite size scully wa never intimidated by men but while scully asserted her authority at every turn anderson found herself fighting just to stand on literal equal ground with her male co star the studio initially required anderson to stand a few foot behind her male partner on camera careful never to step side by side with him it wa another three year before anderson finally closed the wage gap between her pay and duchovny 's having become fed up with accepting le than 'equal pay for equal work 'i can only imagine that at the beginning they wanted me to be the sidekick anderson say of fox 's curious no equal footing rule 'or that somehow maybe it wa enough of a change just to see a woman having this kind of intellectual repartee with a man on camera and surely the audience could n't deal with actually seeing them walk side by side she laugh again this time at the absurdity of the notion of dana scully a anyone 's mere sidekick 'i have such a knee jerk reaction to that stuff a very short tolerance for that shit she say acidly 'i do n't know how long it lasted or if it changed because i eventually said 'fuck no no ' i do n't remember somebody saying 'okay now you get to walk alongside him ' but i imagine it had more to do with my intolerance and spunk than it being an allowance that wa made the work anderson put into securing equal pay back in the ' s seemingly came undone when it came time to negotiate pay for this year 's event series once again anderson wa being offered 'half of what they would pay duchovny 'i 'm surprised that more interviewer have n't brought that up because it 's the truth anderson say of the pay disparity first disclosed in the hollywood reporter 'especially in this climate of woman talking about the reality of unequal pay in this business i think it 's important that it get heard and voiced it wa shocking to me given all the work that i had done in the past to get u to be paid fairly i worked really hard toward that and finally got somewhere with it 'even in interview in the last few year people have said to me 'i ca n't believe that happened how did you feel about it that is insane ' and my response always wa 'that wa then this is now ' and then it happened again i do n't even know what to say about it she stammer for a moment at a loss for word 'it is'sad she finally say 'it is sad anderson and duchovny ultimately took home equal pay for the event series despite the pay issue anderson say she 's 'excited to experience fan ' reaction to the event series whether or not it 's a critical success 'if it 's meant to have a future life and if it 's something that is enough for people then great she say 'and if it 's not then it 's not i am ok with both version of thing anderson like carter say a resurgence of distrust in the american government induced by everything from the nsa 's breach of privacy to the lunacy of the current election cycle have helped carve a place in for the opening of new x files'a marked shift from the end of the show 's original run shortly after the event of september th ' the end of the x file wa during the bush administration and we learned very very quickly after that people could n't speak up openly in public about what they thought we should do or should n't be doing a the result anderson say 'most of our show up until that point was'and still is'about government conspiracy there are conspiracy now about the government having known about or having caused or about it being a ruse and an excuse for u to go into iraq'but it no became no longer ok for people to accuse government of being deceitful or untrustworthy and that wa the backbone of our show asked what her thought are on america 's current presidential election one now surely packed with moment a surreal a anything the x file ever came up with anderson responds naturally with a conspiracy theory 'i heard these comment from people about whether trump is actually on the side of the clinton helping create the worst possible republican candidate and i love that she say 'i mean if that were actually true it is genius in order to get hillary in office i can not imagine'i can not imagine'that if it 's real if he really is a despicable a human being a he behaves that enough american would allow and desire him to be in office a for whether scully and mulder can ever reunite a a couple in the six episode ahead or beyond sorry everyone they 've broken up since we last saw the agent turned fugitive spooning in bed in 's i want to believe anderson 's lip are sealed when i tell her what carter told me about the 'exact moment when mulder first fell for scully 'the moment she walked in his door he say and vice versa 'when she called him from her bed in that first episode'it wa such an intimate moment anderson seems genuinely surprised 'oh wow i 've never heard that she say 'that is surprising while she stop short of approving carter 's pinpoint moment she allows that 'there is something that happens in their first meeting in mulder 's office where they were having an exciting and titillating conversation that maybe neither of them had quite experienced before she say 'there wa something in that moment that sparked an appreciation despite the frustration that ensued after that that lit a fire that ha never been put out but for now anderson'who 's kept a steady stream of work with lauded turn on the british stage and on tv in hannibal the fall and most recently war and peace'is headed back to london where she now life with her husband and three child her youngest felix recently sat with her through one of her favorite x file episode 'bad blood a tongue in cheek masterpiece in which one story is told separately through both mulder and scully 's perspective 'i wa trying to choose the least scary one she explains 'these kid have seen everything they 've seen harry potter they 've seen the orcs they 've seen the scariest thing on the planet and for some reason that fucking episode give them nightmare every week it wa a disaster she moan quivering somewhere between laughter and tear 'it 's not funny i showed it to him last fucking july it bit me in the as like you would n't believe but surely the nightmare wo n't last forever right 'i do n't know what age they 're gon na be when they 're finally over it but right now i 'm the mean mom that

neglected to take the bar exam so it 's with some caution that i find myself puzzling over the notion that it would be tricky to mount a legal challenge to sen ted cruz 's right to run for president the question is about 'standing 'the legal concept that someone ha to have skin in the game to go into court with a complaint 'it is not enough that a person is merely interested a a member of the general public in the resolution of the dispute a the free dictionary explains 'the person must have a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy the constitution pretty much rule out the idea of court issuing opinion that do n't involve real 'cases or 'controversies 'which mean that donald trump is off the mark when he thoughtfully suggests that cruz waltz into court and get a 'declaratory judgment that he is indeed a 'natural born citizen this question popped up'and then popped right back down again'during the short lived campaign of gov george romney he wa born in mexico to american parent and again in john mccain wa born in the canal zone a u s controlled strip of panama trevor potter then the chair of the federal election commission said recently that the fec wa not 'clear is who would have standing to bring a legal challenge and at what stage in the process harvard law professor lawrence tribe trump 's now favorite legal scholar raise a similar question in a recent tv appearance when it come to getting candidate kicked off ballot many jurisdiction take a very broad view of who ha a right to try in new york state for instance the 'the law allows any registered voter who can vote for the candidate to file written objection with the board of election challenging the candidate 's designating petition the fight can then move to the court in fact this is something of a cottage industry in new york where lawyer specialize in helping client throw potential foe off the ballot for highly petty reasons'leaving out the middle initial of petition signer ' name for example chicago ha a similar approach'which is why now embattled mayor rahm emanuel had to fight all the way to the illinois supreme court to establish that he had been a resident of the city long enough to qualify for the ballot okay but we 're talking about the presidency not some local judgeship election who would have the 'standing to challenge ted cruz status well let 's start with a hypothetical suppose arnold schwarzenegger bored with his return to acting decided to run for president he 's clearly monumentally incredibly ineligible born in austria to austrian parent undaunted he gather enough signature to qualify for the new hampshire ballot and submits them along with his certified check for to the secretary of state 's office'whereupon the more or le permanent holder of that office bill gardner refuse to put him on the ballot suppose though gardner see the possibility of even more attention showered on his state if he put schwarzenegger on the ballot and he doe so is it really hard to figure out who would have 'standing to challenge this decision the answer is every other candidate on the republican ballot who would argue that he or she would be 'irreparably harmed by having to compete for vote with an ineligible candidate the fact that no candidate ha challenged cruz'in new hampshire or any other state'may simply reflect the idea that it might backfire politically or it might reflect that the weight of legal scholarship is on the side of cruz there 's no question though that between state official and opposing candidate there are plenty of way to pose a challenge even to a potential president indeed just recently the ohio secretary of state struck martin o'malley from the primary ballot for failing to gather enough signature to qualify and it may not take a candidate to mount such a challenge a complainant named newton boris schwartz sr ha filed a class action in a houston federal court on behalf of himself and 'all eligible texas and nationally registered eligible and or qualified voter in every primary and general election state it would take an expansive view of standing to let this case proceed but judge have wide discretion when it come to matter never dealt with by the court if cruz were to win the nomination a whole new set of potential legal minefield awaits in some state an official'usually the secretary of state'has the authority to decide who is eligible to run if that official declares that he or she read the constitution to require a birth on american soil then a court fight would obviously follow or suppose a democratic presidential elector'those unknown faceless people who actually elect the president'argues that her chance to win is being diminished by elector pledged to an ineligible candidate she might well lose her case'that 's my assumption'but she 's got a strong argument that she ha skin in the game apart from the merit there 's a compelling practical case for permitting such challenge at these stage of the contest why because the absolute very worst catastrophically bad time to bring the case would be after the inauguration let 's say it 's april l president cruz ha signed a law defunding planned parenthood the organization and it client bring suit arguing that the law is void because cruz doe not meet the 'natural born citizen test clearly planned parenthood and those using it service would have standing to bring legal action they 're obviously affected by that new law and suppose evidence surface that in fact his mom had renounced her u s citizenship if a court then found that cruz wa not entitled to be president every action he 'd taken'every law signed every executive order issued every appointment made'would be null and void hello chaos to be clear my argument here is about who would have the legal standing to be heard in court on the merit cruz ' right to run for president appears clear of course should the case ever get to the court one question might prove decisive if he 's asked how many men there are on a football team and he say 'twelve that 's the end of his campaign,20582.0

increasingly poor decision of todd margaret 'i would even get pissy about it after the hundredth person wa like 'hey man is there going to be any more todd margaret ' and at that point i 'd be like 'no man how can there be ' cross tell the daily beast a he ride the east river ferry from manhattan to brooklyn 'i never had any intention of bringing it back the story wa done not only wa the story 'done but at the end of 'series two 'cross us the british parlance for season a the show originated on the uk 's channel before getting picked up by ifc stateside'his title character literally blew up the world it wa a pretty definitive period on the show in an age of countless reboots and revival on television yet somehow the show is back with new episode premiering on ifc thursday nearly four year to the day after the previous series began airing in the u s and in the process the title ha lost it qualifier now it 's simply called todd margaret after the little seen show wa rediscovered by cross 's fan on netflix ifc came calling asking the creator if he would ever consider pretending that whole end of the world thing did n't happen the executive pitched the idea of prequel or maybe even a 'zombie post apocalypse but cross immediately shut them down 'i wa like 'no i 'm not interested in anything like that ' he say 'but i did say out of professional courtesy and respect i will go back to the other writer and see if they have any idea ultimately it wa cross 's co writer mark chappell who came up with 'the craziest most fucking brilliant idea i could ever imagine for this project after hearing it cross quickly called his long time comedy partner bob odenkirk from mr show and w bob david and told him 'fuck i have to do this i ca n't not do this while a four year gap between season may seem interminable for some fan it is nothing compared to the unusually long break that preceded some of cross 's other recent project seven year elapsed between the end of arrested development on fox in and it revival on netflix in and from the end of mr show on hbo in to it return a w bob david nearly year passed 'these are three project that i really really enjoy doing i rarely take work that i do n't think i 'll enjoy on some level cross say 'i 'm very lucky few people get to do that once i got to do it three time he describes his much obsessed over work a tobias f nke on arrested development a a 'paid vacation and swears that he no inside scoop on a potential fifth season of that show 'i 'm not being cute cross insists 'so far everything i 've learned ha been from the internet i know they 're writing them or talking about them but nobody 's talked to me i 'm dying to do more they 're really fun in podcast interview over the past year executive producer brian grazer promised new episode of arrested on netflix and even said that production wa slated to begin in january but all of that wa news to cross who say his entire and part of is already 'completely booked showrunner mitch hurwitz did some fancy maneuver to work around the increasingly busy cast member ' schedule for season four but at this rate it doe not look like we will see more of the bluth clan anytime over the next two year busiest of all is the show 's patriarch jeffrey tambor who ha been winning countless award and non stop critical praise for his role a maura pfefferman on transparent cross say he find tambor 's performance 'amazing but added that he doe n't feel the weight of the show 's transgender theme a much a he think he 's 'supposed to 'as good a the acting is i just have to take a little break he say explaining that he ca n't watch too many episode in a row 'i just do n't care because i 'm a white cisgender ethnophobic transmogrifier 'i also have to get a glossary because i 'm not up on the way to not label people he joke that doe n't mean cross ha lost the political edge to his comedy which came to a head shortly after when his stand up act wa full of scathing george w bush joke but while bush made him angry donald trump just seems to make him sad 'i find him just a cipher for the sad ignorant hateful part of america 's id cross say of trump but at the same time he add 'i think he 's important i think it 's really important to see that there 's a fairly large chunk of the american citizenry who are knee jerk reactionary racist xenophobic people who are just misinformed i think and seem to have lost their humanity while trump 's message used to be available only from angry fox news viewer and the comment section of breitbart com cross think it 's important that they are now out on the open 'they 're having rally and we get to see and hear them in person he say 'and there are thousand ten of thousand people attending these event 'i do n't think he 'll be president of the united state but it 's important to show that this idea of american exceptionalism is long gone because that 's not exceptional cross add 'there 's nothing exceptional about him or his diehard acolyte 'what ha it been three year i 'm surprised to see you after that last episode rock 's jack macbrayer say in the first episode of todd margaret 's third season playing a character formerly portrayed by spike jonze 'you look different cross 's character acknowledges 'this one is a bit of a mystery and a puzzle you have to figure out cross say of the new series 'and you kind of figure it out along with todd what 's happening and he 's a completely different character look different act different while the old todd margaret wa an incompetent low level american office worker with a bald head and no facial hair the todd we meet in series three ha a full head of hair and a goatee along with a more important position at the fictional company and a whole lot more confidence returning to the show are sharon horgan blake harrison and cross 's arrested development co star will arnett each playing bizarro version of their old character like the latest season of arrested cross admits that the the new episode 'will really not make much sense to anyone who ha n't seen what came before he described fitting those various puzzle piece together a the 'biggest

lightsabered to death by his son kylo ren but the character will live to see another day in disney lucasfilm 's highly anticipated still untitled 'young han solo project set to premiere on a far far away date may on monday variety published eight name from an alleged shortlist of actor still in the running to play the iconic character a a young man in the film which will be directed by the lego movie 's phil lord and chris miller mile teller ansel elgort dave franco jack reynor scott eastwood logan lerman emory cohen and blake jenner the film is still a year away from shooting but the stake have been raised now that young han solo will reportedly make a cameo in this winter 's standalone star war film rogue one from that shortlist teller and elgort are probably our best bet despite his bizarre antic in last summer 's sit down with esquire 's anna peele year old teller remains a highly respected actor who can deliver both an award worthy performance in whiplash and help prop up a young adult franchise like the divergent series but his participation in this past year 's fantastic four disaster is n't doing his career any favor at elgort is an even fresher face and doe bear at least a passing resemblance to a young ford he joined teller in the divergent film and ha seen some success in weepy teen drama like the fault in our star but he ha yet to carry a film on his shoulder and the solo role will be a lot to carry perhaps the most intriguing name on disney 's list is emory cohen who put in a sweet and affecting performance a saoirse ronan 's love interest in last year 's brooklyn demonstrating a combination of humor and heart the role will no doubt need the ability to pull off han solo 's combination of wry wit and action star charisma is the major challenge any actor who step into the role will face it wa that type of natural charm that led ford on his trajectory to become the highest grossing movie star of all time a feat he just achieved this past year'surpassing samuel l jackson'thanks to the force awakens james franco 's younger brother dave may be funny but nobody is going to put their money on him in a fight if oscar isaac had n't played what wa essentially a young han solo a poe dameron in the force awakens he might make an obvious choice same go for chris pratt who proved he can do funny sci fi action in guardian of the galaxy but is already reportedly being tapped to play a younger version of ford in the rumored indiana jones prequels of course both of those actor are over ford 's age when the first star war film wa released disney ha obviously put a lot of stock in youth'each of the actor on that shortlist are under 'but the studio may be prematurely eliminating some more bankable option just because they happen to have been born in the early ' s here are five other actor including two over age the studio should consider before it 's too late jack o'connell year old jack o'connell got burned by unbroken he put in an excellent performance a olympic runner louis zamperini but there wa nothing he could do to save angelina jolie 's bloated surprisingly boring movie from itself he did however earn himself a bafta rising star award and he 's even got that coveted teen girl market on lock due to his heartthrob performance in the short lived but much obsessed over series skin nicholas hoult and what about o'connell 's skin co star nicholas hoult with his transformative performance a the pale deranged nux in mad max fury road hoult almost made audience forget his earlier work a the cute kid from about a boy he ha also made his name in the superhero circuit playing beast in the x men film for a more human hoult performance see his work a a young gay college student opposite colin firth in a single man michael b jordan the big question on everyone 's mind doe young han solo have to look like young harrison ford the reality is no matter who disney cast you 'll have to suspend disbelief because no one look exactly like young harrison ford if michael b jordan can essentially play a young rocky balboa then why ca n't be play young han solo ramus malek again the egyptian american year old ramus malek look nothing like harrison ford but how fun would it be to see him shed the nervous awkward uncomfortable character he play on the golden globe winning mr robot and show a different side of himself in the star war universe anyone who ha seen or heard interview with him know he is nothing like his character elliot alderson in real life joseph gordon levitt finally here 's an idea that seems outside the box at first but might actually be the most obvious choice of all jgl turn this year making him the same age a ford when the first star war film wa released he is a huge star with a solid track record of both comedy don jon and action the dark knight rise looper he 's charming a hell and really need a win after that whole debacle with the walk plus a he demonstrated in day of summer he

them to make one walker an art therapist and healing art coordinator with the national intrepid center of excellence nicoe at walter reed national military medical center run an art therapy program in which service member returning home from iraq and afghanistan with ptsd or a traumatic brain injury tbi are asked to make papier m ch mask to express their feeling 'it 's actually the first art directive they 're introduced to a they come through the program walker told the daily beast 'these are service member that sometimes have trouble verbalizing what they 're struggling with and these mask along with all the artwork they create help to make their invisible wound visible the result are stirring one mask striped in red and black with hollow chrome colored eye is wrapped in razor wire with a lock where it mouth should be another haunting paper face eye bloodshot mouth agape is being crushed by a vice bearing the acronym for traumatic brain injury and post traumatic stress disorder the mask are so evocative and insightful that the national endowment for the art nea through it military healing art partnership is now funding an analysis of of them at drexel university in philadelphia 'what this give u is a chance to understand the military experience from the service member 's perspective said dr girija kaimal a professor of creative art therapy in drexel 's college of nursing and health profession and a collaborator on the study in a press release the mask kaimal explained are especially significant because they provide an outlet for non verbal expression at a time when verbal communication may be challenging for the service member people with ptsd a the department of veteran affair dva note may practice extreme avoidance of traumatic thought and feeling which 'can interfere with your emotional recovery and healing neuroimaging study have also shown that ptsd can decrease activity in broca 's area of the brain which play a key role in speech and language 'a lot of research will tell you that when you 're in a traumatic experience the part of the brain that control speech shuts down said kaimal 'so having a nonverbal way'such a art'to communicate is key to understanding what they 're going through according to the dva ptsd affect between and percent of veteran from operation iraqi freedom and enduring freedom traumatic brain injury which heightens the risk of depression and ptsd account for percent of combat casualty in iraq and afghanistan according to the department of defense and the defense and veteran 's brain injury center kaimal and her colleague at drexel are hoping to better understand the psychology of these wounded service member through theme found in the mask for instance many participant in the art therapy program cut the mask or embed shrapnel in the papier m ch mold to illustrate their pain needle and nail are often inserted into the forehead there are other common theme added walker who ha now seen close to mask come out of the program 'the one that we 're seeing the most is the split sense of self or the dual identity she told the daily beast 'one side of the mask is maybe who they are when they 're deployed or in theater or the part of themselves that wa injured and the other part is the part of themselves that they think remains intact or who they are when they 're at home with their family another recurring motif is the manipulation of mouth many service member paint over the mouth of the mask stitch them shut or even place gag in them 'many of the mask have guilt grief written on them or depicted said kaimal 'they have thing on their mouth to show that they are n't allowed to talk or that they feel they should talk about what they 're feeling ultimately creating the mask can help service member do just that talk 'the art making bypass problem with speech and language and access different part of the brain that they can then use to express and apply word to what they 've created explained walker noting that this approach may prove easier for some service member than simply 'sitting down with a talk therapist and trying to describe what 's occurred according to kaimal and walker the mask can sometimes even help to alleviate symptom of ptsd in one case study that is being highlighted at drexel a service member who wa deployed in iraq recreated a bloody face that haunted him in ptsd related flashback over the course of art therapy he put his mask into a box and closed it significantly reducing the frequency of his flashback a a result 'through art therapy with m walker he wa able to externalize a lot of feeling that were trapped in him said kaimal one unintended consequence of the mask making program is that it ha helped those outside the military better understand the effect of tbi and ptsd walker told the daily beast that although service member create an array of artwork during her program the mask often elicit the most attention from outsider and tourist 'this can bring u a little closer to the experience because it give them a way to show u rather than tell u she said for the nea military healing art partnership which began in when the national endowment for the art first helped nicoe expand the art therapy program at walter reed the mask making is one of many recent success in the partnership brought the same art therapy program to the fort belvoir community hospital brain wellness center in virginia and in late they announced a further expansion in collaboration with the department of defense art is indeed the right word for these mask many service member walker said are astonished by the quality of what they manage to make in the first week of her program often without any formal training or experience 'what i tell them is because they 've been through so much they have a lot to express she said,5023.0

dressed to the nine anyway fresh off a fancier appointment apologizing for how nice she look and talking a fast a katharine hepburn on cocaine we order a large cheese pizza it doe n't survive the interview bloom 's story is a digital age american dream six year ago she wa writing and producing comedy song on youtube her first viral hit wa an explicit tribute to the author of fahrenheit entitled fuck me ray bradbury a few year later devil wear prada screenwriter aline brosh mckenna clicked on one of her video looked her up co wrote a pilot with her and the rest wa history albeit a tortuous one that involved pitching their show to several network landing a showtime deal that fell through and weathering gloomy rating at the cw despite widespread critical acclaim now with a brand new golden globe in hand bloom 's future is looking bright her television debut is untraditional but it is quintessentially american too crazy ex girlfriend follows high powered but depressed new york lawyer rebecca bunch bloom on an ill advised quest to win back her old summer camp flame josh vincent rodriguez iii in west covina california it is a musical comedy not in the glee sense but in the authentic and a bloom note 'patriotic sense in true astaire and rogers style the character break out into original song and dance number when word alone will no longer do sure that genre ha root across the pond but it wa perfected on celluloid here before being all but banished back to broadway during our sit down which wa condensed and edited for space bloom wax passionate about bringing the musical back to the screen however small and about so many other thing her fan onscreen diversity the possibility of a second season and of course the pizza in your acceptance speech you talked about the rejection you faced shopping crazy ex around to different network wa it frustrating to have something so unique and weird on your hand but to have trouble selling it it wa really frustrating because we knew we had created something good and all of the rejection were different some place just say 'it 's not for u which at the end of the day network have their own agenda so it ha nothing to do with you but one place said 'oh we thought it 'd be edgier now in the original pilot i give greg santino fontana a hand job i wax my asshole i do n't know what you mean by fucking 'edgier and i think what they meant wa that it 's ultimately an optimistic show lean over my voice recorder 'oh wow a huge pizza just came just so you remember while you 're listening to this recording oh yes oh my god give me just one second to bask in the glow of this pizza oh it 's really hot i 'll let it cool off'so it wa frustrating especially when you hear that it 's not edgy enough or 'oh we wish you were younger younger are n't you that 's the other thing i talked about rejection but i 'm the most fortunate fucking person in the world i have my own show at and a golden globe so yes i face rejection but i 've also been very fortunate and understand how fortunate i am many creator of tv musical comedy find a way to repurpose their old material but none of your youtube song have shown up in crazy ex so far when did you decide to go all new always we 've tried to occasionally repurpose stuff and that rarely work we 're doing a musical television show'it 's the kind of thing i 've always wanted to do'where the music is both funny but also really doe further the plot and come from character the definition of a musical is that the emotion is so strong that you ca n't talk anymore you have to sing the emotion is n't strong enough when you 're just like 'let 's take a second to sing about lamp it ha to come from the emotion for our show because rebecca 's emotional state is so heightened and there 's so much juicy emotional stuff to mine it would have to be such an aside if you were to try it with 'fuck me ray bradbury the whole story would have to be about wanting to meet ray bradbury that being said do you feel pressure given the way television is promoted online to produce song that work both in the narrative and a standalone viral video a hundred percent you know what that ha n't worked 'sexy getting ready song ha gone viral but short of that no other song from our show ha gone viral i think our song are awesome and some of the video are successful but you ca n't really control what go viral all i can do is make video that are funny and that can also be poignant but if the goal is to go viral you 'll go crazy you seem to have a really deep commitment to the genre of the musical ' i love musical theater so much when done right i think comedy song can be the most efficient form of joke delivery song can be the most efficient and the best form of conveying emotion music is universal it 's worldwide and a lot of people forget or do n't know that the modern musical is an american art form it started a operetta in europe but'gershwin jerome kern irving berlin george m cohan rodgers and hammerstein'it 's an american art form and if you support musical theater it 's patriotic if i had time to say that in the golden globe speech i would have said 'the american musical is alive and well one of the place it life is network television i have such pride in furthering the american musical and using it a a way to tell story the first musical you ever saw guy and doll i saw it when i wa five in a community theater production it wa amazing the thing that strike me the most about you a a performer is how much energy you have whether it 's on the show itself or backstage singing an impromptu tune about tweeting at tony shalhoub where do you get it a lot of it stem from fear of death and fear of failure and fear of looking back and being like 'i could have tweeted more i could have done this more i 'm having the time of my life i get to make a musical television show but ultimately it 's fear of not using every opportunity not carpe ing that diem not taking advantage of the moment i also love it i 'm having so much fun and i 'm also devouring this pizza and i 'm having so much fun devouring it and you have a golden globe ' that still ha n't really hit me did it cross your mind that it could win you were a favorite to win so it wa like shrug 'eh and then a couple day before i thought i might win it crossed my mind i wrote a speech that i promptly threw away when i actually won and then rolling stone said i wa the frontrunner that 's when my co creator wa like 'rachel you might win what 's your speech about and then i started to become the frontrunner at all these other publication literally two day before that wa when i wa like 'oh fuck i might like fucking win this thing you spent your entire speech thanking people which is something you 're always doing with fan on social medium now that you 've got the globe when are you going to start acting untouchable when we 're a rating hit laugh i 'm so grateful to fan i owe my career to fan it 's hurtful to be making a show that is critically acclaimed but because we happen to be on a broadcast network our rating are under so much scrutiny you know it 's hurtful to go on tv by the number and see 'likely to be canceled i know that 's based on number but like fuck off that 's not how the cw make u feel but when you 're on a network the rating are so important so anyone i meet who say 'i love your show i 'm like 'oh my gosh thank you i get starstruck when i meet fan i 'm checking those same site with my finger crossed ' here 's the thing i think this globe win mean our second season i 'd be shocked if we did n't get a second season there 's a huge conversation about diversity and feminism around your show especially with josh being filipino american watching it though it just feel real how much of the conversation around diversity on television is actually about representing ' ' thing a they are josh chan rodriguez iii wa always going to be an asian bro always the reason we picked that wa n't because 'oh asian need to be represented more on tv how do we help that that wa a plus we were thinking 'what ha n't been done before what 's a new story we can tell what 's a new type of character we 've seen the bro we have n't seen an asian bro i really think diversity is simultaneous with telling new story because i do n't know 'white people hanging out in a coffee shop ha been done diversity is just more artistically interesting to me because you 're in new territory and the whole purpose of making art in my head is to explore topic that have n't been explored i have never seen a show that took place in southern california and portrayed people the way it is in southern california the prom king in my high school wa chinese and the prom queen wa japanese we just did n't think about it it wa like 'oh yeah george and mika they 're the prom king and queen it wa n't until i realized that every other show is set in some nebulous town on the east coast or midwest where everyone is white and protestant ' how boring is that and that 's not truth that 's not my truth i remember a a kid living in southern california and every tv show wa set in that typical east coast high school and i remember seeing a high school near me that looked like that and thinking 'oh a real high school that 's not feeling marginalized now if i thought about that about like the way my school looked imagine being a filipino person who 's like 'i 'm not a real american because i 'm not on tv we 're a nation of immigrant that 's what being an american is one of the diverse story you 're telling is about your character 's struggle with mental illness which seems like a difficult topic for a comedy to approach ' 'which is so funny because every comedian i know is on antidepressant and ha a very dark sense of humor it always take a while i think for tv and film to catch up with what 's already being done in the alternative comedy world every friend i know we all have dark sens of humor about our depression our anxiety our family issue i guess what 's groundbreaking is doing it on network television but to me i 've been joking with my friend about this shit for year and i think that what it is new is truth and it 's honesty and it 's not labeling it a an other it make for tricky viewing though because you want rebecca to grow a a person but if you relate to her you also want her to get what she want even when it 's not right for her it 's funny you say that because it 's the struggle that we have look ultimately when rebecca 's cured a a person the show 's over the show 's about someone in crisis and if she 's learning she 's learning very slowly and if we get a second season she 'll be learning veeeeery slowly if at all so it 's that struggle between happiness that can last versus happiness that can go away you share initial with rebecca bunch how much of the character is you her life is on the surface very different from mine i would say that it 's emotionally autobiographical like percent a far a the actual detail of her life percent it 's like me if i never pursued theater or art'i 'd be miserable,15685.0

antonia josepha johanna von habsburg lothringen composed a secret letter i love you madly the woman more commonly known a marie antoinette wrote from the tuileries palace where she languished under house arrest there is never a moment in which i do not adore you see the pdf the letter 's sentimental declaration were later blacked out and for good reason it recipient wa not her husband king louis xvi but her alleged long time lover the swedish count axel von fersen this furtive lettre d'amour and others like it were recently deciphered by a team at france 's research center for the conservation of collection crcc who used modern technology including x ray and different infrared scanner to reveal the redacted word of love between the count and the doomed queen the revelation come two month prior to the release of a new book i love you madly ' marie antoinette the secret letter due to hit british and french shelf in march in the book british historian evelyn farr document the pair 's clandestine courtship through more than other secret letter that farr spent about a year deciphering a she trawled archive across europe the pair 's lusty liaison ha been addressed before in both fictional and non fictional account including sophia coppola 's big screen adaptation with jamie fifty shade of gray dornan playing the suave swedish count antonia fraser 's biography marie antoinette the journey published in also address their affair however a fraser acknowledges in the book there wa no solid proof that the love story actually took place a a result the torrid relationship ha been subject to much speculation among historian particularly the french popular theory include an innocent platonic friendship between the two and a one sided infatuation even the chateau de versailles ' official website describes fersen a an intimate friend of marie antoinette 's noting the nature of the relationship between the swedish count and the queen ha been much commented on historically their liaison is not certified and this mystery nourishes the legend farr 's discovery coupled with the crcc 's revelation may take the legend a step closer to confirmed reality french historian have typically been on the fence about this subject farr told the daily beast acknowledging that marie antoinette did have many male platonic friend including the count valentin esterh zy to whom she also wrote however if you compare the letter she wrote to valentin and the letter written to fersen you can see the difference in tone with valentin it wa always 'my dear count ' not 'i love you madly ' would you write 'i love you madly ' to a platonic friend well maybe according to fanny cosandey a french historian and a professor at the school for advanced study in the social science in paris while the count and the queen may have shared a love story it likely only unfolded on the page not in the bedroom personally i do n't think it wa possible for queen marie antoinette to have had an actual physical relationship with fersen cosandey told the daily beast maybe it wa a platonic love maybe it wa a stronger relationship ' but i do n't think these document are going to tell u much more we need more information she added nevertheless some of the letter farr present in her book ' many of which were written in code or in invisible ink ' reveal passionate word that seem a cinematic and over the top a the legend of the late queen herself i live and exist only to love you ' adoring you is my only consolation fersen wrote to her after she had fled to varennes in an ill fated attempt to escape revolutionary paris and in another fersen wrote i love you and will always love you madly all my life ' without you there is no happiness for me some of the more scintillating claim in farr 's book concern the paternity of two of the queen 's child according to the letter and other document princess sophie and louis charles were in fact fathered by fersen a revelation that farr admits could raise ire in certain circle i have a hard time believing it said cosandey first of all would it have been possible for the queen to have maintained this secret relationship to the extent that she had child with fersen without the rest of the court being aware of it at all moreover would the queen have taken such a risk it would have threatened the french monarchy nothing 's impossible of course but we would need other proof beyond these letter she added you must really put everything in context and analyze where the text came from why he said what he did why it wa anonymous and so forth farr who said that either fersen himself or one of his descendant redacted the letter say that she ha merely presented the evidence and that it is up to reader to draw their own conclusion regardless of any scandale that could spring from the publication of this century old covert correspondence farr see evidence of the love story a a happy discovery that provides crucial insight into the legendary woman behind the regal myth you ca n't understand marie antoinette if you do not understand that he count fersen wa the most important person in her life she said,24117.0

surfaced accusing amy schumer of doing just that comparing her stand up sketch and bit from comedy central 's inside amy schumer to similar joke by other comic including wendy liebman kathleen madigan tammy pescatelli and the late patrice o'neal the video wa removed from vimeo which like the daily beast is owned by iac on thursday after viacom which owns comedy central claimed copyright infringement viacom did not respond to request for comment by the time this story wa published schumer defended herself on comedian jim norton 's sirius xm radio show in a nearly hour long special episode that aired wednesday night 'i will take a polygraph test and put it on my show this season she said adding that she had never seen or heard any of the bit that were posted in the video and that 'both kathleen and wendy know me and they do n't believe i would do that norton is a longtime friend of schumer and previously came to her defense in october when she wa first accused of stealing o'neal 's joke schumer said she did n't believe the accusation were 'personal but that 'people build people up and then they like to rip them down because they 're experiencing some success she 'd asked to go on norton 's show she said because she wanted to clear her name '' because more than anything i want credibility a a comic'i do n't think comedian can forgive joke stealing'i 'm not going to become one of those people who is known for taking other people 's joke i 'm the fattest ugliest monster with the stinkiest vagina'keep writing that but do n't call me a joke thief indeed comedian do n't easily forgive joke thief carlos mencia wa blacklisted from the comedy world after joe rogan a fellow comic confronted him about plagiarizing during a set at the comedy store in los angeles rogan had previously called him out for lifting other comic ' material in a blog post but after the video went viral people began posting clip of mencia 's bit next to those of other comic much like the schumer video mencia 's joke theft wa particularly egregious he copied an infamous bit from bill cosby almost word for word mimicking cosby 's delivery and using the exact same punchline denis leary 's career wa never the same after he wa accused of stealing joke from bill hick and louis c k dane cook suffered from similar accusation and also alleged that steve byrne stole his 'essence though not a mightily a leary and mencia robin williams wa also thought to have lifted other comic ' material 'people stopped doing their act when he would come in to the comedy cellar because they were worried he might lift something pete dominick host of sirius xm 's stand up with pete dominick told the daily beast of williams dominick who know schumer from the comedy cellar when they performed there before she became famous doe n't think she stole from anyone 'comedians are n't inclined to steal not because it will necessarily ruin their career but because they want the respect of other comedian he said ' amy paid her due she got into all the club she 's a comic 's comic she 's fucked a lot of people but she ha n't fucked anyone over sam morril another comic who met schumer at the comedy cellar agreed 'amy is not a thief he wrote in an email 'she is a special comic who care about comedy also if there 's a trainwreck and they 're looking for a swarthy looking jew i am available dave rubin who ha his own radio show doe n't know schumer but saw video and did n't think the comparison were particularly obvious 'the cadence of the wendy joke is similar but i do n't think there 's any evidence she necessarily stole it rubin said 'if what amy said is good enough for wendy then it 's certainly good enough for me he added referring to liebman 's latest tweet in defense of schumer attributing their similar bit to greatminds parallelthinking around the time the video posted liebman commented in a now deleted tweet 'amy schumer doing of my best joke on her hbo special pescatelli ha also deleted a series a tweet regarding schumer and the video 'what ha always been amazing to me is that she purport to be a feminist and yet only steal from other female comedian she wrote 'if we call her on it we are 'jealous ' or career shamed be successful we want you to do well just do it with your own material btw she blocked me schumer claimed on norton 's show that she 'd blocked pescatelli because she wa 'unkind to rachel feinstein a comedian and schumer 's good friend on thursday pescatelli apologized to schumer again via siriusxm 's opie and jim norton program for accusing her 'it went too far and for that i 'm super apologetic schumer had 'every right to be mad pescatelli added a lot of joke in comedy are derivative they 're mined from universal experience like sex love parenting family'which is why comic have to work particularly hard to distinguish themselves the schumer video raise question whether we can ever be sure of the originality of a joke dominick said we can 'there 's an unwritten rule at the comedy cellar that any comic who becomes a father ha to watch all of ray romano 's material because he 's already done all the parenting joke dominick said 'all stand up comedy ha a premise and a punchline he added 'the situation is what 's specific and your own vulnerability your own honesty or a rubin said 'the one and only thing that every comic agrees on is that you do not steal joke it 's a lot easier to steal now because comic just tweet joke that are often the genesis of what 's going to become a much longer bit i 'm doing stand up much more sparingly now but when a funny one liner come to me i 'm hesitant to tweet it because i know someone could do it in a club i remember working with this guy who wa lifting idea from everyone he justified it a 'parallel evolution ' i thought 'if you could only put that kind of creativity in your joke ',27933.0

about enough with hillary clinton 's attack and if the two democratic frontrunners liked each other before this race those feeling were long gone it began appropriately enough with a gun fight a the first vote of the democratic primary are only week away clinton ha pounded sander relentlessly for his past position on guns'insinuating in a recent ad that he wa siding with the gun lobby over president obama 's push for more gun regulation she never mention sander ' name of course but it 's one wink short of 'rhymes with manders asked about clinton 's attempt to tie him to the gun lobby sander came out swinging 'well i think secretary clinton know that what she say is very disingenuous he said ' i have a d minus voting record from the nra clinton hit back invoking the murder of nine african american last year in their charleston church by a white man with federal charge pending against him which should have prevented him from getting a gun 'he voted for what we call the charleston loophole she began sounding just a tad rehearsed 'he voted for immunity from gunmakers and seller which the nra said wa the most important piece of gun legislation in year clinton accused sander of turning a blind eye to gun regulation until this race 'now i am pleased to hear that senator sander ha reversed his position on immunity and i look forward to him joining with those member of congress who have already introduced legislation she said a she spoke sander unsuccessfully tried to mask his grimace with smile and seemed to be just waiting for the opportunity to hit back and he did when asked why the former secretary of state wa out polling him with minority two to one 'well let me talk about polling sander began channeling his inner donald trump 'as secretary clinton well know when this campaign began she wa point ahead of me we were all of three percentage point guess what in iowa new hampshire the race is very very close maybe we 're ahead new hampshire and it 's true it 's a scenario made of night terror for clinton who eight year ago lost iowa to another insurgent progressive who her campaign drastically underestimated if you listen closely you can almost hear her whispering softly 'one two three wake up that 's not to say she 'll lose the nomination if iowa and new hampshire go for sanders'south carolina clinton is ahead by point in the real clear

sander would go negative they pointed to sander ' pledge to remain positive'and accused him of becoming more of a politician by the day and sander took the opportunity to knock her again when asked about the ad on sunday night 'well the first difference is i do n't take money from big bank i do n't get personal speaking fee from goldman sachs sander said a reference to clinton 's pricey speaking fee during her time out of office he then went on to describe his belief that the large financial institution should be broken up clinton countered that sander wa so far left he even opposed obama who helped push through wall street reform like dodd frank she can take the attack clinton began but when sander started to attack obama'that wa too far 'senator sander called him 'weak ' 'disappointing '

frank and i 'm going to defend president obama for taking on wall street taking on the financial industry and getting result it wa n't the first time during the debate that clinton hugged president

corner of it history last week for instance in the northern republic of komi local official reportedly burned all college book published with the support of the soros foundation which promotes education a a vital component of democracy but on this cold monday morning suddenly the sense of threat great much worse a conflict between russia 's liberal civil society and the leadership of chechnya a muslim republic in russia 's south boiled over with a single very ugly tweet magomed daudov speaker of the chechen parliament speaker and the second highest authority in that republic posted a picture on his instagram of the republic 's leader ramzan kadyrov holding the leash of his snarling dog 'tarzan an enormous caucasian shepherd next to the picture daudov named the dog 's potential victim independent public figure in russia the post said that tarzan 's fang are itching in derisive language daudov hinted that the dog could bite opposition politician ilya yashin and editor in chief alexei venediktov 'together with his loud echo that is radio echo of moscow and two well known russian human right activist lev ponomaryov and igor kalyapin the beastly threat might sound metaphorical but they take place in a very real and menacing context the investigation of the murder of former russian vice prime minister boris nemtsov ha named a chechen mastermind behind the politician 's assassination and russia ha a long list of political assassination both in the north caucasus and on the street of moscow that were performed by chechen contract killer not many in russia could support the idea of setting dog on people in any case but this kind of threat hit a nerve deeply embedded in this country 's history 'nazi soldier used shepherd to attack victim in

venediktov remains in the city and contnues going to work but he doe not walk anywhere without bodyguard 'every head of every russian law enforcement agency is informed about the threat we have received from the chechen leadership venediktov told the daily beast 'we hope that the head of the investigative committee of russia alexander bastrykin will ask president putin why official threatening a chief editor of a federal medium are still holding their post for the first time in russia 's modern history moscow official and parliament member demanded that law enforcement push back and prosecute chechen leader kadyrov and remove him from his position kadyrov who last april ordered his police to shoot officer from other part of russia triggered the conflict last week by using the language associated in russia with stalin era repression kadyrov posted a statement on an official internet web site saying that critic of vladimir putin 's politics 'should be regarded a enemy of the people and traitor moscow journalist and civil activist anton krasovsky said that ironically because kadyrov is so unpopular in most of russia his threat 'helped to legitimize russian liberal civil

a 'disservice to putin parliament deputy maksim reznik told kommersant newspaper that 'the head of the chechen republic is publicly calling for anti constitutional action that should mean his

said what many other political observer have been thinking 'donald trump is just not funny anymore that is the popular meme that ha been circulating throughout the medium and the chattering class of pundit analyst and anyone else with an opinion and a burning desire to share it i 've heard it multiple time in the last several week this idea that the republican frontrunner is no longer a amusing and entertaining a he wa a few month ago but ha morphed into something divisive demagogic and dangerous i do n't know what planet these folk live on but you can be sure that wherever it is there are no latino on it there are however score of latino in the united state who'because of trump 's boorish knack for insulting mexico and mexican immigrant literally from the moment that he leapt off the starting block and announced his candidacy on june ' would say that trump wa never much fun to begin with we sure did n't take much joy from his nativist swipe at jeb bush for speaking spanish on the campaign trail and crass insinuation that bush is a moderate on immigration because his wife columba wa born in mexico before coming to the united state legally and becoming a u s citizen and while we would agree that the real estate mogul can be described a divisive demagogic and dangerous many of u are wondering what took the rest of america so long to figure this out for much of the nation 's largest minority'the estimated million people who make up the u s latino population le than percent of whom have a favorable opinion of trump according to polls'the billionaire blowhard did n't just become the gop 's problem child overnight the truth is that he ha been that way since the moment he claimed without a sliver of evidence to back it up that mexico wa 'sending the united state it worst people'including rapist murderer and other criminal the medium seem to have missed this part of the story they know that latino do n't like trump but they do n't really understand just how deep this animosity go or how long it is likely to last they must think that latino will just eventually get over trump 's tirade which only illustrates how little they know about latino when we hold grudge we think in term of century so in all likelihood latino are going to be hating on trump for a long time let 's start at the beginning for the first five month of his presidential bid the real estate mogul wa a novelty this quality made him attractive to republican primary voter and irresistible to a broadcast medium that wa starved for rating and ad revenue with the subtlety of an air strike trump said what wa on his mind without a filter consultant or handler he did n't use focus group or rely on polling before making major pronouncement or suggesting radical shift in policy he ripped into both political party with equal enthusiasm and called out opponent by name if there is some unwritten code of professional courtesy that keep politician from telling u how they really feel about one another the donald did n't get a copy in just about every way you could imagine he wa refreshing and even'and dare we say it'fun in fact a if to emphasize that point the huffington post initially featured story about trump not in it 'politics but in that portion of the site dedicated to 'entertainment it 's also worth noting that with few exception and with some early attempt to poke at trump by repeating and amplifying some of his controversial remark the fourth estate ha for the most part been on friendly term with the presidential hopeful i remember the exact moment when this epiphany hit me it wa november and while on the road for a speech i wa watching cnn 's 'erin burnett outfront trump wa the guest and the topic wa immigration the dialogue between host and guest wa cordial and burnett'who wa formerly a financial news reporter'kept referring to trump by his first name it wa donald this and donald that i have a tough time imaging burnett or for that matter anyone else in the medium casually referring to other presidential candidate a 'jeb or 'hillary of course jeb and hillary have proper honorific title that trump lack i know that but how about going with 'mr trump there 's a weird chumminess to it for the new york medium much of their familiarity with trump come from the fact the real estate tycoon is shall we say 'from the neighborhood his spectacular manhattan penthouse atop trump tower is just a short limousine ride from some of the skyscraper that house the major television network besides it certainly did n't hurt that'even for a republican'trump is considered by many to be a moderate on social issue he also ha a long history of contributing to and voting for democratic candidate including hillary clinton whatever the reason trump spent the first five month of his presidential campaign gliding along on a magic carpet of friendly medium coverage he took care of the medium by being available at a moment 's notice when they called and by consisting delivering high rating and the medium took care of the donald by giving him ten of million dollar in earned medium and handling him with kid glove but then came the sixth month'december'when after being atop dozen of poll for week on end the donald suddenly became le fun and more scary the tipping point came on the fateful day of dec that 's when trump shocked the country by calling for a temporary freeze on visa for muslim seeking to enter the united state just a few day earlier a terrorist attack in san bernardino carried out by supporter of the islamic state had killed people and wounded others worried that element of the u s muslim community might be in cahoot with terrorist trump urged a moratorium on muslim traveling to the united state until 'our leader figure out what the hell is going on that 's a good question what the hell is going on many american really want to know the answer to that question and they agree with trump that the obama administration doe n't have a clue about the enemy or how to fight it and in the absence of any serious and meaningful policy from the white house trump ha filled the vacuum in fact according to the poll a majority of people agree with the candidate 's proposed moratorium on muslim getting visa what sound controversial to some strike others a common sense but the medium and the chattering class are n't buying any of it the proposal rubbed them the wrong way they pounced on trump immediately some insisted that he is a bigot others accused him of stoking fear and resorting to demagoguery in order to pick on people who do n't have a voice to which latino can only wince and respond 'gee you do n't say,28715.0

the start of the year 's first grand slam tournament the bbc and buzzfeed news ran jointly reported story alleging that the tennis integrity unit formed in to deal with a previous betting scandal had kept secret file on player suspected of throwing match eight of these men were now competing at the australian open why had n't authority cracked down on this suspected corruption the game 's official argued that bbc and buzzfeed had recycled old news and that the tiu had only algorithmic evidence of match fixing without hard proof they insisted they could neither reveal the name of the suspected player nor discus whether much le what kind of investigation they had carried out no formal charge or finding of guilt have been made however according to press report including the new york time legal gambling operation came to their own conclusion and took certain match off the board because of suspicious betting pattern absent thus far ha been any historical perspective in fact corruption ha always been a constant a topspin on the tour back in the day when the game wa officially 'amateur player took pay offs under the table and often the bagman were the very people appointed to enforce the rule a i have written in the past after the advent of the professional era in star still demanded secret bribe or guarantee to show up for tournament these euphemistically named 'appearance fee although forbidden by the official code of conduct often exceeded the publicly declared prize money and sometimes resulted in top player pocketing a wad of cash losing on purpose and flying off to lucrative promotional event although personal convenience not gambling drove this form of match dumping the enormous amount of black money floating around brought accusation of tax fraud steffi graf boris becker and arantxa sanchez vicario were investigated for tax fraud and embezzlement in amsterdam for instance a tournament employee wa accused of embezzling money from the abn amro bank in order to pay ion tiriac a cash guarantee to ensure the participation of his client guillermo vila tiriac responded by accusing the tournament official of extortion wimbledon and u s open champion arthur ashe warned that guarantee created a climate of corruption in which even umpire were compromised the game 's greatest booster bud collins went on record saying 'tennis wa born in dishonesty and ha never outgrown it just a they 're doing in the current betting scandal tennis authority back then including the international tennis federation and association of tennis professional maintained it wa difficult to police hundred of player and tournament while the itf code of conduct pdf appeared to provide them broad power to investigate and punish offender they lamented that they needed name and fact not rumor then when they had name and fact they said they needed evidence that would stand up in a court of law they swore they took seriously all accusation of wrongdoing but a i learned when writing short circuit they responded to report of rule breaking by attacking the bearer of bad news rather than investigate what i revealed about prize money splitting match fixing and double match tanked with the knowledge and complicity of tournament official they banned me from the u s open and physically rousted me out of the press box at the italian open after adamantly denying for decade that guarantee existed men 's tennis legalized them now top player collected money up front then decided just how long they cared to stick around gene scott the tournament director in moscow told me in about an agent who tried to negotiate a guarantee for a wimbledon champion admitting up front that his client intended to lose in the first round the problem scott agreed wa systemic now that agent were open about match fixing thinking thing might be different on the woman 's tour i waited a decade then wrote lady of the court about the distaff side of the sport again one did n't need to be woodward or bernstein to uncover mind blowing malfeasance many involving the physical and sexual abuse of young girl by their parent and coach an entire book could be written on this subject but it also interested me that the woman 's tennis association continued to ban guarantee for the same ethical reason that the men 's tour previously outlawed them then in when steffi graf 's father wa indicted in germany for criminal tax fraud pre trial deposition revealed that steffi had accepted over million in appearance fee in four year i supplied these court document to the woman 's tennis association pointing out that this incontrovertible evidence subjected steffi to immediate suspension fine and penalty and to the forfeiture of prize money and not least the title she had won including half a dozen grand slam the wta went silent for month then it curtly announced that steffi graf had not taken guarantee they refused to discus how they came to that conclusion would n't say whether they had questioned steffi or her father and offered no evidence to contradict the sworn pre trial testimony so these day when i hear that tennis ca n't crack down on corruption unless it ha hard evidence i wonder exactly what they want since even court document produced under oath do n't do the job a wiser writer than i might have cut his loss and gone on to a simpler subject like insider trading on wall street or mafia money laundering but stolid a the ancient mariner with an albatross yoked around his neck i kept producing article about tennis 's indifference to crime and misdemeanor that put athlete in other sport in jail eventually with the growth of online gambling and the influence of organized crime tanking and match fixing turned into something more than a peccadillo in a minor sport it ha only been low ranked player thus far who have been convicted of match fixing for betting purpose there ha been a supposition that journeyman player tired of star creaming off all the gravy they created a revenue stream for themselves by feeding information to betting syndicate or placing wager on match they knew were about to be tanked in i participated with frank deford in an hbo tv special about betting and match fixing in tennis which touched on many of these issue i ca n't claim that my effort have led to serious reform and i harbor no illusion that the current dust up will prompt tennis to enforce the rule it ha written for itself the latest news from australia is that the great alphabet soup of tennis organization ha set up a committee the independent review panel to examine the operation of the tiu and 'make recommendation for change i 'll believe change is imminent only when i see guy run on court at wimbledon with fbi not nike

rivera to co sponsor legislation that would allow undocumented immigrant to pay in state tuition rate this issue combine the dual ghost of rubio 's past both of which he is trying to escape a he navigates his way through a tough gop presidential primary his relationship with rivera a former congressman under investigation a the alleged mastermind of a campaign finance scheme and his record on immigration which his fellow presidential contender have criticized for being insufficiently tough the immigration issue ha become especially important in the republican field this week 's political coverage wa dominated by discussion over gop frontrunner donald trump 's first commercial which depicted illegal immigrant streaming over the border after the last republican debate rubio and sen ted cruz spent day trading barb over who wa telling the truth about the other 's immigration record it 's not the first time the immigration issue ha proven to be a vulnerability for major presidential candidate in the and election cycle former gov rick perry wa savaged for allowing undocumented immigrant to pay in state tuition in texas mitt romney in his attempt to appear tough on illegal immigration talked up his plan for 'self deportation which sounded about a far fetched then a donald trump 's plan for a mexican funded wall on the border seem today but for rubio the immigration issue loom particularly large rubio 's reputation a a politician wa in part shaped by his participation in the bipartisan 'gang of eight ' which sought to pas comprehensive immigration reform in rubio ha since distanced himself from the immigration reform effort he once championed but back in and he wa even more generous to undocumented immigrant rubio and rivera co sponsored legislation that would have allowed undocumented immigrant to pay in state tuition in community college and state university those who resided in the state and attended a florida high school for three year prior to graduation would be able to pay in state tuition the legislation proposed if the student pledged to file an application to be a u s permanent resident a soon a he or she is able to do so the legislation would not be adopted in or but wa part of a year long effort that continued well beyond rubio 's time in the state legislature ultimately in republican gov rick scott signed into law an initiative that would undocumented immigrant to pay in state tuition something that is now in effect in state even at the time it wa an issue that split republican rubio supported the in state tuition proposal for immigrant student but said his leadership remained fearful that the legislation would be a boon for illegal immigrant the miami herald reported in both rubio 's former immigration proposal and his association with rivera have become political liability in the year since rubio wa burned and continues to be plagued by his association with the senate 'gang of eight ' their comprehensive immigration bill never became law and the senator ha been accused by his opponent of having supported 'amnesty ' his support for giving undocumented immigrant receiving in state tuition rate add fuel to the flame giving his opponent ammunition in a race that ha been defined by trump and populist outrage over immigration 'it surprise no one that rubio ha been a consistent supporter of policy that encourage more and more illegal immigration while rubio double down on amnesty and want to reward those who have broken the law ted cruz ha led the fight to stop it catherine frazier a cruz spokeswoman told the daily beast ' cruz is unapologetic about the importance of enforcing our law and putting an end to policy that encourage people to break our law rubio 's stance have shifted back and forth through the year in oct rubio said that a a general rule people in the united state who are here without document should not benefit from program like in state tuition but in he said that a law permitting in state tuition for undocumented immigrant should be something they could consider i think the better approach is to solve the immigration problem at the federal level neither the rubio campaign nor rivera responded to a request for comment on whether they stood behind their in state tuition proposal nowadays rubio immigration strategy is more hardline he call for securing the border first before any other immigration reform are to be pursued rubio 's record on in state tuition for undocumented immigrant also brings back into view david rivera who ha been an ally to rubio since the two both got started in florida politics in the past for example jeb bush 's campaign ha made a point of trying to dissuade donor away from rubio by labelling him a risky bet in part due to his association with rivera the two pol owned a home together in tallahassee which led to it own mini scandal when it faced foreclosure just a rubio wa running for u s senate a they were both ascending in their career rubio and rivera were often inseparable but now that rubio is running for office the tie have been publicly cut rivera wa hit with a fine this year for improper billing of government fund while a florida house member but while rubio is apparently done with rivera rivera is n't done with appearing publicly at event that rubio is attending on at least two occasion at the cleveland and milwaukee republican presidential debate the ethically challenged former congressman ha been spotted in the audience a the first presidential contest near and the microscope continues to hone in on rubio 's record the florida senator will confront these dual liability or else face an electorate that 's largely looking for a stricter messenger on immigration,39508.0

medium star just a few year younger than u it 's a polished production coming out video are one of the most popular genre of video on youtube according to a report published on the youtube trend blog there were over video on the platform a of last february of which had been posted within the last year for some of the most popular vloggers like aaron and austin rhodes the view count are in the million last october when youtube star trevor moran came out a gay he racked up a million view and generated a dozen headline shane dawson 's bisexual coming out video attracted view and an official note of congratulation from the human right campaign ingrid nilsen 's 'something i want you to know coming out surpassed it with view when traditional medium celebrity come out on social medium the splash is just a large a week ago hunger game actress amandla stenberg came out a bisexual while operating teen vogue 's snapchat account cue teen vogue with the exclusive scoop 'amandla stenberg identifies a a black bisexual woman at this point coming out video have reached such a critical mass that medium outlet and even other youtubers are starting to produce list of the 'best coming out video or even the 'top or the 'top biggest youtubers who came out a gay a if they could be ranked somehow yahoo declared youtube the 'in place to come out there 's even an instructional video on youtube about how to come out on youtube the more coming out video youtube creator produce the more conventional the genre ha become most are well lit tightly framed talking head with text reading 'i 'm gay or 'coming out superimposed on the thumbnail they typically open with a bit of build up to the magic word nilsen 's for example open with a big sigh followed by 'ok i 'm doing this and then it happens the reveal 'i 'm gay i 'm firmly in favor of more people coming out a lgbt especially brave younger people who are getting it out of the way early on in life millennials are by far the gayest generation or at least the generation most likely to openly identify a lgbt according to the public religion research institute the overall proportion of lgbt people in the population likely ha n't changed so that finding speaks mostly to a reduction of stigma around non normative gender and sexual identity that ca n't be anything but good but maybe this youtube coming out trend is n't all good when we 're generating listicles of the best young people to disclose their sexual identity it 's probably time to take a step back and re evaluate one reason to be suspicious is the obvious fact that youtube is making money off of the popularity of coming out video according to youtube trend all the video in the genre have collectively accrued more than view estimate of revenue per view vary but roughly speaking content creator could have collectively made close to half a million dollar from disclosing their identity on the platform youtube 's earnings would be comparable based on the revenue split i 'm nowhere near cynical enough to suggest that young youtubers are coming out for the money for a generation that practically breathes video where else would they make a big announcement vlogging is a new medium and for popular creator it 's not uncommon to feel a personal connection to their subscriber but i am cynical enough to believe that youtube could possibly have an interest in the ad revenue from mega viral coming out video that lead to ellen appearance that lead to even more view between the trend post and an official lgbt compilation video in which they included several coming out youtube is certainly not discouraging the format of the coming out video but if lgbt kid and young adult get to come out and everyone make a little money in the process what 's the harm after all it 's not a if people should avoid being themselves on social medium a our life become increasingly digital it 's expected that the act of coming out would fundamentally change last october for example in honor of national coming out day facebook revealed that approximately american came out on facebook'a number they uncovered by tracking update to sexual orientation and gender identity on user ' profile the problem though is n't necessarily how people are coming out it 's that a surrounding internet discourse hungry for big reveals swallow and amplifies their story to the exclusion of other more important facet of lgbt experience coming out after all is n't a one way ticket to freedom and it 's hardly the end of most people 's story in the supposedly liberated s when the prevailing wisdom wa that sexuality wa repressed and we needed to let it out french philosopher michel foucault pointed out how often the social force that we claim silence u actually encourage u to talk about sexuality in order to bring u further under their control 'there is a very significant difference between interdiction or prohibition about sexuality and other form of interdiction he wrote 'unlike other interdiction sexual interdiction are constantly connected with the obligation to tell the truth about oneself his chief example the catholic church doe n't prohibit discussion of sex it actually invite u to talk about it at length in the confession booth to tell the truth about ourselves over and over again foucault 's point wa n't that we should all shut up stay in the closet and assimilate to the mainstream'he wa himself a gay political radical'but rather that we should be wary of believing that we always free ourselves when we come out a gender theorist judith butler would later write 'conventionally one come out of the closet so we are out of the closet but into what what new unbounded spatiality identity category like lesbian gay bisexual and transgender can be necessary in order to make sense of our experience but they can also become box that constrain them a modern example men disclose that they are gay but then the fda regulates their ability to donate blood youtube and snapchat might feel like realm of endless freedom and individual expression'what butler called 'unbounded spatiality 'but how far are they really from the confession booth and what new constraint are waiting once the coming out bubble burst should we be alarmed that facebook is apparently closely monitoring user ' gender and sexual identity or that youtube keep track of how many view lgbt creator get when they come out probably it 's especially telling that traffic to coming out video dwarf traffic to vlogs about other aspect of lgbt life sure something salacious like lesbian touching a penis for the first time will rack up the view but check the count on a video about a transgender woman discussing the problem with chromosome based sex determination or a video about biphobia in the lesbian community the public love the first part of the lgbt story'the tearful confession the catharsis the dramatic declaration'but it doe n't seem to want to stick around to find out what happens next they love the i am but the so what not so much it 's the same reason why nearly million people tuned in to watch caitlyn jenner come out but almost no one watched i am cait there 's a universal appeal to the coming out section of the story because it soothes u into believing that we always have the power to shape our circumstance instead of the other way around the nitty gritty detail of what it 's like to actually be lgbt'the information that would help build empathy and that could lead to further social change and legislative action'does n't provide that same reassurance this doe n't mean that the new kid on the digital block are to blame for public apathy toward lgbt issue but it doe call into question the enterprise of coming out on social medium in carefully produced video and the furor that surround it what is it accomplishing who 's watching and why,59695.0

embarrassing damning sea of white now sir ian mckellen ha given the ceremony another sound and justifiable kicking for it lack of lgbt representation and awareness no openly gay actor ha ever won an

crunching the number of oscar nominated film and actor over the last decade reveals a shocking paucity of lgbt themed film in the best picture category a well a a total lack a mckellen said of out gay artist in the acting category of the film nominated for best picture since only per cent had an lgbtq protagonist per cent had a heterosexual protagonist the presence of out performer like ellen degeneres and neil patrick harris obscures the continued dearth of out a list actor the name you can name are individual one offs'zachary quinto'not part of a large or commanding group why this is and why there are so few gay themed movie getting made and rewarded is part of a vicious circle that take in both money and simple cowardice television not film is where we go now to see black and lgbt character of variety and nuance mainstream film 's view of the world seems pallid anachronistic very white and very straight in comparison movie making hollywood is an industry and like film to make money and the feeling is simply that gay themed movie with gay lead characters'and the statistic would seem to imply gay lead actors'will not make money the audience will be nervous of them and thus reject them if the audience doe not go to a movie that film will not make money and so hollywood'a place not exactly empty of lgbt people'fights shy of doing right by lgbts being complicit in this odd circle of silence and ignorance surely must be strange for lgbt people working in hollywood unless their venality and ambition cancel out their entire sense of political and cultural engagement of course from time to time an odd big screen success'preferably of a vintage style involving people fighting to assert their same sex identity and desire in different time brokeback mountain carol

private and not drawn to elicit sympathy but of course milk 's heroism is underscored by his assassination and his minting a a gay right martyr other lgbt movie are made and attain their own status independently'like the brilliant vibrant frisky tangerine but rather like the institutionalized racism the lack of black oscar nomination revealed the lack of openly gay actor and gay themed film show hollywood 's institutionalized homophobia'an institutionalized homophobia that gay men and woman preside over themselves to turn a profit the outrage over the last few week ha been centered on the oscar themselves but the oscar are the shiny obvious window dressing on deeper prejudice deficiency and absence when i spoke to quinto for attitude magazine recently about being one of the few out a list actor he said closeted gay celebrity had come to him for advice 'i just share my experience and say 'this is how it went down for me this is how i feel ' i tell them 'trust that even if it mean you 're not a famous or even if it mean it 's not exactly what you thought it would be it 's still more valuable when you 're assessing your life at the end of that ' on being out he said 'if you 're an actor who 's afraid of it or think there 's something you 're not going to be able to achieve or accomplish if you come out then i have to disagree with you he said 'if you do n't want it to be part of the public conversation i respect that i do feel i am plowing a lonely road but i 'm just trying to do something quinto star of action movie like agent told me he had worked in a more 'consistent and diverse way since coming out 'i think it 's going to continue to evolve i think we 'll all look back at this time and say how lucky we were to be a part of the evolution i have no interest in dragging people out if people are conditioned to live their life based on what other people think of them that 's a really heavy way to live 'on some level it 's really dark and unsatisfying to me i just know i 'm happy i 'm thrilled with the life i get to live i wake up in the morning and look at this man i love and i just feel so grateful but quinto should n't be one of very few out a lister and'similarly in it fiction producing universe'hollywood should feature black and lgbt story in a consistent and diverse stream there should be black and lgbt hero and villain there should be black and lgbt lead character secondary characters'and when possible black and lgbt focused story themselves there should be openly gay actor playing straight and straight playing gay hollywood will nod along vigorously return to their office and ask how can we make these film if no one will come to watch them but audience will if the story are compellingly told and if hollywood again duck it head to say it is only responding to audience demand and audience simply do not want this'they would rather have cgi robot indulging in witty repartee and half werewolf and action heroes'then one would have to ask how this cycle of demand and expectation is being produced and perpetuated of course it is all hollywood 's whacko code machine it both propagates and consumes a unitary diet the beast creates eats then regurgitates it own cinematic bonemeal it matter that the academy say it will change the composition and complexion of oscar voter but for what will they be voting a the debate over diversity continues to bubble'and a actor asked this year 's urgent 'diversity ' question and try to answer without alienating their own paymasters'it wa an optimistic sign indeed that nate parker 's the birth of a nation set a sundance purchasing record but will parker 's stunning looking film and carol and the 'next big gay movie ' and 'next big black movie ' after them be standalone totem to offset the criticism leveled at hollywood for their lack of diversity or will in the best way their success filter down into the film making mainstream and encourage story not just set in tortured historical time important a they are to dramatize but in the modern era a lack of black and openly gay face on award ' stage is blatantly wrong and depressing but that lack is the manifestation of a more fundamental lack of investment in black and gay talent and storytelling in hollywood racism and homophobia have become inextricably insidiously intertwined with balance

act in the past year ' london and madrid paris bali nightclub lebanon mali san bernardino and countless others'were carried out by practicing salafi jihadist at the rand corporation terrorism expert seth g jones released a report early last year 'the persistent threat the evolution of al qa'ida and other salafi jihadist which document an increase in 'salafi jihadist group from three in to in the number of fighter ha increased from just a few in to a many a to in the quilliam foundation founded by daily beast contributor and counter extremism expert maajid nawaz published a report in titled 'it 's salafi jihadist insurgency stupid in four girl left canada to join isi after study at the al huda institute in mississauga ontario a few month ago the tony blair faith foundation published a report 'inside the jihadi mind dissecting the propaganda and ideology of 'salafi jihadism with theme of 'the nobility of jihad the 'end of humiliation and the 'disgrace of enemy researcher including terrorism expert emman el badawy said they found islamic teaching in percent of the propaganda of 'salafi jihadism that they studied over four decade i'and dozen of other muslim with whom i have spoken'have seen the spirit of religious dogmatism overtake the life of loved one a the government of saudi arabia and qatar have exported their state religion of salafism to the world they are buttressed by the teaching of islamist ideologue like syed qutb the godfather of the muslim brotherhood in egypt maulana mawdudi a godfather of islamist movement in pakistan india and bangladesh like tablighi jamaat and jaamat islami and abdullah azzam teacher to a generation of afghan and pakistani fighter including al qaeda leader osama bin ladin and ayman al zawahiri key to their most extreme teaching is the romanticization of 'jihad and martyrdom when i first arrived in pakistan in the summer of i saw the first inkling of this ideology through a female cousin a dear pen pal of mine she wa starting to get influenced by the saudi islamization of pakistan which started with the rise to power of general zia ul haq in and the radicalizing of u s sponsored afghan warrior into 'mujahideen fighting the soviet with the ussr 's invasion of afghanistan in during that time salafi ideology cross fertilized with a traditionally conservative ideology of south asia called deobandism the deobandi ideology is named for a village in my native state of uttar pradesh in northern india where the school is based at the university darul uloom deoband or 'house of knowledge deoband i have family member who studied there and it ultraconservative dogmatism influenced my paternal and maternal lineage with my mother a a rising teen having to wear the black face veil and burka or gown militant deobandism ha become the ideology of the afghan taliban and pakistani militant group my pen pal retreated away from playing late night game of gin rummy with our male first cousin because by conservative interpretation of islam where one can marry first cousin they were suddenly haram forbidden or illegal to her they were potential marital partner back in the u s in the early s i got disturbing news one day from my mother that a cousin in gaithersburg maryland'indoctrinated to extremist islam through the tablighi jamaat a missionary group founded outside delhi a an offshoot of deobandism'had taken his wife and child to india on a ruse and seized their passport refusing to let them return to america the story wa he had seen a note from his daughter indicating she had a crush on a white boy at school and he did n't want his child 'corrupted they remained in india not long ago one son returned to the united state the daughter a star college graduate in india got married and life in saudi arabia wearing a full face veil by 'choice back in pakistan 'dr farhat started al huda in indoctrinating woman by the thousand to her hyper religious doctrine born in the province of punjab in pakistan she earned a phd in hadith study at the university of glasgow and taught at the international islamic university in islamabad largely influenced by saudi salafi ideology in fact saudi arabia 's late leader faisal donated a towering mosque in islamabad to the university soon some husband of dr farhat 's pupil were protesting that their wife had become 'extremist when i went to pakistan after the attack i saw my pen pal cousin had grown even more rigid in her religiosity now wearing a tight headscarf and my aunt otherwise liberal when growing up in our native india had started to cover their face in black veil and shroud their body in black burkas'just like the newly married tafsheen malik did when she arrived year later in the united state according to the security camera photo released by law enforcement for the men who followed their wife ' lead they grew their beard but shaved their moustache following doctrine promoted on salafi website that a hadith or tradition of the prophet muhammad hold that growing the mustache is haram in south asia the school of thought associated with salafi are 'ahl al hadith or the 'people with the hadith with a literal and strict view of hadith if the alphabet soup of name is confusing that 's because extremist islamist ideology just like anything are filled with competition rivalry and power play one facebook user take a swath through the group with this page 'we sunni must unite to fight wahabi salafi deobandi tablig jamat terrorism in karachi i saw the face of the deobandi militancy in the face of the men who kidnapped my colleague from the wall street journal danny pearl when i saw a police report on one suspect on the line for religion the police had n't written 'muslim or 'sunni or 'shia they had written 'deobandi they knew and meanwhile his kidnapper omar sheikh had been indoctrinated by radical salafi cleric in london and his alleged murderer khalid sheikh mohammed or 'ksm had studied under the respected salafi scholar of the afghan mujahideen and in fact in when fbi agent frank pellegrino landed in doha qatar a salafi state to arrest ksm the future mastermind of the attack wa alerted by someone in authority and escaped extradition to the united state u s authority were that close to stopping the planning before they had even begun like the clue that i got when i saw the 'like for al huda international when i heard the name of the san bernardino husband 's mosque '' dar al uloom al isl miyah of america 'my heart sank i knew the husband wa immersed in a very rigid islam akin to the deobandi ideology that ha cross fertilized with 'salafi jihadist with or without formal affiliation with the mosque in india darul uloom deoband we know in our community that a 'darul uloom mosque follows a hyper conservative islam connected to deobandi or salafi islam or both mosque official did n't return message seeking comment salafi thinking is based off of the writing of an th century saudi scholar muhammad ibn abd al wahhab thus saudi thinking ha most often been known a 'wahhabism in the salafi school of thought adherent 'place a great emphasis on literal interpretation of the

twitter user including me have said the report note that isi ha pledge of allegiance from 'salafi jihadi group with 'salafi jihadi foreign volunteer arriving from around the world to fight to 're

intentioned in defending islam when they deny the islam in islamic state they are wrong and they are doing muslim a disservice by not dealing honestly with the issue that confront u a muslim the official at syed farook 's mosque said they do n't support violence meanwhile fbi director james comey announced that the san bernardino shooter may not have supported isi on social medium american muslim widely shared headline about this recent revelation with one facebook user demanding 'who will make retraction about the san bernardino case the headline however glossed over a more important revelation by the fbi director in late before they married the couple wa 'communicating online showing sign in that communication of their joint commitment to jihad and martyrdom those communication are direct private message the revelation of the 'joint commitment to jihad and martyrdom underscore a singular point that unfortunately too many muslim leader still want to deny with flimsy excuse and conspiracy theory but most of u in the muslim world have seen all this too clearly'and painfully'over the past four decade ever since the government of saudi arabia started pumping out the virulent ideology of salafism 's 'jihad inc into the world with all it intolerance rigidity anti western prejudice hatred of israel sexism and misogyny the san bernardino couple are just the latest to ascribe to salafism 's violent belief in a political islam that support an islamic caliphate with a small 'c if not the self proclaimed 'islamic state of isi the fbi director did n't say what kind of 'jihad it wa but we know it wa n't an irish jihad or a pagan jihad it wa a violent islamist jihad rooted in the most intolerant expression of salafism on the night of the san bernardino attack seeing the 'like of 'dr farhat by tafsheen malik 's mother in law took me back to the woman 's halaqa or quran study circle session that i attended in islamabad in the day after the attack meeting the middle class and upper middle class pakistani woman who were devoted alhuda student they bragged about the 'glow of piety on the face of their teacher in their halaqa meeting they prayed feverishly against the west they lambasted christian and jew and they swapped theory about always concluding 'the jew did it they sold clothes from their wedding trousseau to raise fund for taliban and muslim militant in pakistan supporting those on the path to 'jihad and martyrdom that 's why i called the woman 'the taliban lady auxiliary at one meeting a woman sold wedding trousseau finery and second hand clothes like a shocking pink fabric with flower tagged a 'suit piece rupee to raise fund for the mujahedin fighting the west the school that tafsheen malik attended also teach muslim woman that they should wear the niqab or face veil the class so sickened me that i fled to karachi where ala militant took that same hate against jew to justify killing my friend danny who wa jewish this fall on the night of the paris attack i walked onto the set of hbo 's 'real time hosted by bill maher a liberal comedian who ha been a leader in the u s 'forcing a conversation about islamic extremism despite being vilified by apologists'and i urged viewer 'wake up to the threat of islamic extremist ideology to the west i noted 'we have to be honest about the fact that there is an ideology of islam that is our war of our generation and this is an ideology that we have to address and we have to address it with moral courage since then i have heard from hundred of viewer who are heeding the call to action not out of any irrational fear of islam or muslim but because they like me want rational threat assessment and effective solution which should include an islamic reformation in which a progressive interpretation of islam becomes normative this past december i stood with other courageous muslim woman and men in washington d c to launch the muslim reform movement to challenge 'violent islamist ideology by whatever name we call it following our announcement we walked through the gate of the saudi led mosque on massachusetts avenue because we need to stop the path of muslim like tafsheen

but on monday afternoon in new hampshire a state legislator representing the trump campaign accepted the 'no label seal of approval on his behalf proving once again there is no medium event that the donald ca n't hijack the other five presidential candidate who got the no label nod span the political spectrum from ben carson and rand paul on the right to chris christie and john kasich from the more establishment lane to martin o'malley the lone democrat among them each had promised if elected to pursue the group 's four goal create million job over ten year secure medicare and social security for the year balance the budget by and energy security by trump would add a fifth goal to make america safe and secure said freshman rep fred doucette in his enthusiastic introduction of trump who did not appear at the event none of the awardees attended the noon luncheon but christie and o'malley appeared by video the latter getting rousing applause when he chided the group for 'watering down and dumbing down your seal when you bestow it on someone like donald trump a former mayor and governor who proudly wear no label ' 'problem solver badge o'malley called out trump for saying thing that are racist and for making a 'fascist appeal judging by the spirited reception o'malley got from the otherwise polite crowd there is dissension within the no label rank about elevating trump when his rhetoric is so clearly contrary to the group 's mission until the group unveiled the six who had taken 'the promise to meet within thirty day of inauguration with a group of bipartisan congressional leader to address this new 'national strategic agenda and it four goal it wa anybody 's guess which of the candidate they would be and noticeably absent were hillary clinton on the democratic side and jeb bush for the republican the vice chair of no label are thomas f 'mack mclarty a longtime clinton friend and loyalist and al cardenas former chairman of the florida republican party and a bush patron where were their candidate reached by phone mclarty acknowledged that bush and clinton are 'known for taking the no label approach but that each campaign had decided this is 'not the time to make the promise in the primary and that is their choice mclarty urged not to make too much of their absence or of trump 's taking center stage yet again he seems confident that bush clinton and also marco rubio will eventually make the promise no label is in contact with all the campaign bush ha a rule against making formal promise or taking pledge in part to avoid the ubiquitous 'no new tax pledge that come up in every election in after all his father promised not to raise tax and then reversed himself a few year later helping to doom his re election prospect meanwhile clinton is locked in a race against bernie sander for the support of the democratic left so carrying the banner for bipartisanship is not her priority right now 'i 'm glad we got six we could have gotten zero said joe lieberman a former democratic and then independent senator who co chair the grassroots group he said he wa puzzled that more did n't sign on since the four goal are about a close to apple pie a it get in politics still once you start sketching out how to achieve entitlement reform or a balanced budget there is always controversy around potential tax hike or program cut and candidate worry they might be setting a trap for themselves new jersey governor christie one of the six seemed like the most comfortable with the group 's goal 'i 'm happy to disrupt dysfunction he said a play on lieberman 's phrase that washington need 'constructive disrupters in his video remark christie highlighted his detailed plan on entitlement reform which would end social security benefit for people earning more than a year he said he would not raise tax to keep the program solvent 'raising tax just give them another pot of money to steal from he said a poll of new hampshire voter conducted by no label found that percent are more likely to vote for someone who made the no label promise and percent prefer a candidate who work with the opposite party 'people are frustrated people are angry but they 're not looking for someone to steamroll the other side said ryan clancy a no label spokesman no label co chair jon huntsman celebrated the variety of ideological

netflix 's ten part documentary about wrongfully convicted wisconsin man steven avery and his eyebrow raising trial for the murder of photographer teresa halbach writer director moira demo and laura ricciardi spent a decade whittling down over hour of footage to craft the docuseries that 's turned viewer into internet sleuthing conspiracy theorist since it hit the streaming service on december 'and even they still wrestle with the big question did avery do it 'what i learned from making this series is the humility to accept that i do n't know and i may never know demo told the daily beast over the holiday break that she and ricciardi properly hijacked filling newsfeeds and social medium stream with the shocked angry and outraged reaction of viewer making their way through making a murderer 'that wa one of the thing we learned doing this just because you have question doe n't mean that you 're going to get an answer she said 'if you 're so committed to finding the truth and finding the answer it 's very hard to be comfortable with ambiguity and you 'll often settle just for some finality the director were nyc graduate film student when the saga of steven avery first caught their attention splashed across national news headline avery a working class local with a record from manitowoc county wisconsin had been exonerated by dna testing in after spending year in prison for a rape he did n't commit two year later avery wa a high profile pebble in the shoe of the manitowoc county sheriff 's department which he wa suing for million'the same authority who eagerly locked him away again when the murder of a local woman led them right back to avery 's door after reading a story in the new york time about avery 's plight filmmaking and romantic partner demo and ricciardi borrowed a camera and hit the road to manitowoc county in a rental set on staying for a week to document avery 's trial a the case wore on they moved in to temporary dig in town scoring key access to avery 's beleaguered family by writing a letter to avery who gave his blessing from behind bar the trial lasted six week and took an unexpected turn when calumet county district attorney ken kratz held a press conference that threw a sensational wrench into the case and into demo and ricciardi 's plan just a they were packing up to head home avery 's year old nephew brendan dassey wa arrested four month after his uncle having implicated himself in the rape and murder of halbach taped footage of his confession provides making a murderer with one of it more troubling element suggesting that dassey wa railroaded by investigator and his own counsel into spinning a fantasy version of the halbach murder after repeatedly denying his involvement in the crime 'one of the thing i hope viewer who really engage with the series will take away from this is this question of if they have lingering question are they comfortable living with that said ricciardi 'there are now two people who are behind bar probably for life do our viewer feel satisfied with the process that led to those conviction the filmmaker had no idea how vast the scope of their film would grow when they first began the project seeing in it a provocative case study of how the american legal system treated one man twice accused 'here wa a man who in wa wronged by the system ricciardi remembered 'it failed him and here he wa year later pulled back in the question really wa had there been any meaningful progress within those year would the system be any more reliable in than it wa in in advance in dna testing exonerated avery of the rape of penny beernsten but in after science saved him once it damned him a prosecutor leaned heavily on fbi laboratory testing for a substance called edta in a blood sample that avery 's defense argued had been tampered with 'i think it really begs the question of the role of science in our criminal justice system said demo 'our system is made up of human being and human being are muddy and complex and flawed a we all know science is this very tempting black and white sort of thing it 's tempting to believe that there is what some refer to a a 'truth meter ' you have dna and we often get asked 'was there dna evidence proving he did it ' we like to think that any kind of evidence whether it be dna evidence or any other kind would just be the beginning of the inquiry not the end of it 'i remember in this process beginning to understand that science and criminal justice it 's very dangerous to put them together demo continued 'our criminal justice system is based on a presumption of innocence until you 're proven guilty'whereas in science something is true until it 's disproved so it 's exactly the opposite we have one kind of test after another that used to be relied upon being revealed to be not so reliable and there 's a problem there some have wondered why avery 's defense did n't fight harder to discredit the fbi 's edta testing a method that had been used ten year prior in the o j simpson case but a avery lament to his mother dolores by phone early in the series 'poor people lose all the time if avery 's team had a many resource available to them a the state had at their disposal demo say they might have been able to put the fbi 's test under more scrutiny instead 'the only thing the defense wa in a position to do wa analyze the data coming out of the fbi lab she said 'they did n't have the fund the fbi is a huge resource that the state wa given'it would have cost ten of thousand of dollar 'in one interview that did n't end up in the series avery defense attorney jerry buting talk about how they would have basically had to go to a university lab ask them to do a research project to find out about degradation in edta all of these thing demo explained 'so really science wa not at the place where it could be used to test this'and yet it wa presented in court making a murderer shed a light on avery 's case a his defense team of buting and co counsel dean strang mount an impassioned case for their client in and out of court letting the filmmaker document their progress a well a their frustration with the case the headline hungry medium and the public servant who fail and foil avery and dassey time and again the unassuming middle aged lawyer with killer courtroom swag and eloquent quotables have become modern day atticus finch for the millennial generation noble defender of justice who have unexpectedly amassed fervent fan following of their own 'we have some sense of that ricciardi laughed 'sometimes people email or tweet thing to u she credit strang and buting with infusing making a murderer with the streak of principled outrage that mark the series it 's easy to see how the dynamic duo have rubbed off on viewer with heartfelt line like those uttered by strang who reacted to avery 's conviction by lamenting 'redemption will have to wait a it so often doe in human affair 'there are way in which people have asked u 'is this series biased is it one sided ' she said 'what i would say in response to that is that we had very articulate subject on the defense side they were passionate they believed in their client and they were in a position to advance this theory that their client had been framed and framed by law enforcement so yes we documented that yes it 's in the series but that wa their opinion and their role a advocate that we simply showed but do n't mistake strang and buting 's perspective for the filmmaker ' she caution 'it doe not mean that we adopted it or that our interest were completely aligned with theirs although demo and ricciardi carefully guard their thought on avery and dassey 's guilt or innocence in interview at time in the ten hour series one might infer the filmmaker ' real sentiment in how they frame the colorful cast of local reporter present at trial an incredulous press conference inquiry here a telling side eye glance there making a murderer condemns the breathless medium reporting of local and national news organization for their role in ensuring that avery and dassey could n't possibly find an untainted jury pool of their peer even a demo and ricciardi present the local reporter they worked alongside for month a a greek chorus foil to the prosecution 'the reporter very much are window character said demo of the press pool which had only heard the state 's version of event until the defense launched their argument at trial 'the courtroom wa the first place they were hearing the defense they were very gracious and very open to collaborating with u but at the same time they were also part of the story and yet they had a different job to do and different access'they had access to the state but they did n't have access to the family so it 's a different story that emerges then there 's kratz the oft smug portly district attorney who easily emerges a making a murderer 's villainous mustache twirling personification of the man kratz declined to be interviewed for the film and earns a memorable coda when the series note the unrelated sex scandal that got him fired after the avery case he publicly decried the series after it debut and after irate fan bombed his yelp page with negative review more pointedly he took to the medium to slam demo and ricciardi for not including crucial evidence in their film that helped a jury convict avery 'you do n't want to muddy up a perfectly good conspiracy movie with what actually happened and certainly not provide the audience with the evidence the jury considered to reject that claim kratz told people citing evidence he presented in court including call avery made to halbach and her reported discomfort at visiting the avery salvage yard after an incident in which avery allegedly answered the door in a towel while in prison for the rape he wa later cleared of avery 'told another inmate of his intent to build a 'torture chamber ' so he could rape torture and kill young woman when he wa released kratz said 'he even drew a diagram 'we wrote a letter to ken kratz saying who we were and that we were interested in including a many point of view a possible in the series ricciardi said 'we offered kratz the opportunity we offered it to the halbach family we offered it to penny beernsten who wa the victim in the case tom kocourek who wa the sheriff dennis vogel and other member of law enforcement demo and ricciardi say time constraint made it necessary to focus only on the evidence introduced in court that they deemed to be most crucial to kratz 's case against avery 'there were clear piece of evidence that the state wa hanging their case on'the most incriminating piece of evidence whether it wa that halbach 's car wa found on the avery salvage property or that her burned remains were found in the burn pit outside of his window or a bullet fragment in his garage that had teresa 's dna on it ricciardi argued citing the limited screen time she and demo planned to devote to the halbach trial 'in the three or so hour we had to cover the trial we had to pick what we perceived to be the state and the prosecution 's most incriminating evidence against steven and those are what we put in the series 'i think any of the piece of evidence not included in the series are le incriminating than any one of the thing i just listed she added 'as filmmaker and a storyteller it 's in our interest to show conflict and to show the strength of the state 's case then show the defense 's argument against it that wa how we structured thing the filmmaker maintain that the avery case wa never a cut and dried a kratz would still have the public believe 'i would add that in closing argument ken kratz argued to the jury 'this case is clear there 's only one reasonable outcome ' ricciardi said 'dean strang 's retort wa 'nothing in this case is clear ' since debuting on netflix making a murderer ha incensed viewer into action sparking several meticulously detailed subreddits dedicated to the avery and dassey case and spurring rumor that hacker group anonymous might unleash the elusive piece of evidence that could potentially exonerate the two men who are serving life sentence for the halbach murder a whitehouse gov petition calling for president obama to pardon the men based on the netflix series ha garnered over signature while a change org petition ha and counting strang eloquent a ever in recent interview say that the avery case still haunt him'and that the release of the series ha generated new lead that could give avery a second chance'again making a murderer mania ha also led to the proliferation of conspiracy theory about who really killed halbach and whether shady scheming on the part of friend and family of both halbach and avery contributed either to her death or the planting of evidence orchestrated to frame avery at first demo and ricciardi chuckle at the thought of incensed viewer deep diving down online rabbit hole hell bent on uncovering the truth of what happened the afternoon of halloween when halbach disappeared after visiting avery 's family salvage yard on assignment for auto trader magazine but making a murderer fanatic have dug more deeply into the case than the filmmaker ever anticipated and the series ' arguable empathy for the avery clan ha brought more than just kratz into the internet 's sight the director very seriously caution against impassioned viewer jumping to conclusion to indict any of the 'characters of making a murderer in the court of public opinion or otherwise 'we always hoped that there would be viewer engagement we just had no idea that people would become amateur sleuth said demo 'i guess it 's just the time we 're living in but in term of people zeroing in on particular individual we would just ask that people check themselves because part of the problem we saw'not only in the case but i would argue a well in the case'was an incredible rush to judgment and member of law enforcement are not the only people who can do that and make that mistake she and ricciardi are heartened by the emotional reaction viewer

produce radar evading warplane on a large scale but a with all military development in china it 's hard to separate fact from communist party sponsored fiction'and equally difficult to predict just how heavily even large number of working j s could weigh on the military balance of power in the pacific region the chinese air force debuted the first prototype of the bulky twin engine twin tail j in december at an airfield in southeast china belonging to the chengdu aerospace corporation a state owned airplane maker beijing 's test pilot got to work putting the new supersonic warplane'at foot long one of the biggest fighter in the world'through it pace testing out it system flight characteristic and engine they 're either russian made al s or chinese w s over the next five year another seven copy of the j joined the first example each sporting small improvement over it predecessor all j s feature the distinctive sharp angle of a plane designed to minimize it detectibility by enemy sensor the first eight j s were developmental meant to support the gradual refinement of the new plane 's final design but the ninth j which government run news outlet xinhua revealed in a dec story is different sign point to this j being the definitive version of the stealth fighter'and the first in what could be a long production run potentially numbering in the score or even hundred of plane to be clear xinhua wa careful to imply but not say outright that the j ha entered full production 'the outside world would interpret it a the first mass produced aircraft of the type j the news site stated and for good reason for starter the ninth j sport all the small improvement of previous copy a well a a different numbering scheme than copy one through eight the apparent prototype bear four digit number on their nose beginning with ' j number nine 's nose code begin with ' 'specifically ' j also made it photographic debut in yellow primer paint a kind of undercoat instead of the black or silverish paint that the eight prototype wear whereas chengdu apparently picked the color scheme for the developmental plane painting of the first production model'which could eventually join a frontline air force unit '' would need to be determined by the military xinhua explained if indeed the ninth j is the first production model the next step for the chinese stealth fighter is pretty clear plane number will join one of the chinese air force 's regular fighter squadron so that pilot and maintenance personnel can begin training on the type more j s will roll out of the factory at chengdu and join until there are enough production model j s for a full squadron of a dozen plane when the squadron ha enough plane and trained pilot and maintainer the air force can declare the first j unit 'combat ready 'a milestone most analyst expect sometime in at that time china will join an exclusive club'as only the second country to field a fleet of frontline radar evading jet the american f the world 's first stealth warplane entered service with the u s air force in the u s b stealth bomber followed in the supersonic f stealth fighter in and the f 's smaller cousin the f in july by the s the pentagon could posse a many a f s plus or so f s and b s no other country ha war ready stealth warplane although russia is working on one'and eight u s ally have ordered the f with several more planning on also buying the plane in the near future but while it 's pretty certain china will soon deploy j s it 's not clear why ' or how effectively'it will do so beijing ha never explained exactly what the j is for is it a ground attack plane like the f a high and fast flying dogfighter like the f or a multi role attack plane and dogfighter like the f and how doe the j fit into the chinese government 's strategy for steadily exanding it sphere of influence into the east and south china sea and the indian ocean eying the j 's large size and sleek line some analyst have claimed that the j is a kind of aerial assassin perhaps it 's meant to fly fast over long distance through u s and allied air defense to fire missile at airborne tanker radar early warning aircraft and spy plane maybe it will lob bomb and rocket at air base and aircraft carrier and carlo kopp an analyst with the air power australia think tank wrote that he anticipates the j 'growing into the air combat role a more powerful engine become available in other word becoming a close in air to air dogfighter on par with the f kopp 's qualifier is important the production model j will apparently enter service with the same engine that power the prototype but the al or w 'it 's not clear which powerplant the j uses'is clearly beijing 's second choice for the new plane chinese engineer are working on the more powerful w which could give the j more speed and maneuverability ' if and when the new motor is ever ready even if the ninth j is n't the first production copy it at least represents another big step toward the production standard'and another impressive feat for the rapidly improving chinese air force but the most important milestone for china 's evolving stealth air force still lie somewhere in the future'its first time in combat the u s air force ha deployed radar evading warplane in all it major conflict since the united state ' invasion of panama by contrast china ha n't fought a full scale war since it abortive attack on vietnam in warplane development in a vacuum is one thing but a beijing 's own news service noted 'war is another matter,35221.0

448,9809467.0,2016-01-11T05:02:00+00:00,thank these trend for donald trump,people are scratching their head wondering how donald trump is still dominating the republican primary race theory abound'a surprising number of which are astute but incomplete arguably the best take on the cause of trump ism have come from nicco mele and norm ornstein but most analyst have sought to push exclusive or simplistic theory the truth is there is no one explanation for trump 's staying power be it stagnant wage which can be blamed on immigration automation and globalization white fear of a minority majority nation see why immigration is such an easy target or any of the other catch all idea that have been put forward in reality what we are witnessing is the culmination of numerous cultural and technological shift many of which have nothing to do with policy or ideology in fact i would argue that trump 's success could not possibly come about by virtue of merely one or two cause this is the product of numerous trend including fear about the rise of isi political correctness run amok a gop establishment that ha largely ignored the concern of the base and an inept president in the white house this phenomenon is bipartisan a is evidenced by the rise of bernie sander but it is much le disruptive on the left republican have been disproportionately hit for a variety of reasons'including the fact that these trend are coming to a head at the very moment the gop is in the wilderness so how 'd we wind up with front runner trump since everyone ha been talking about the frustration being felt by white working class voter a well a a sense that america 'no longer win a trump say i thought it would be helpful to also catalogue some of the le talked about trend that have contributed to trump ism the rise of alternative medium donald trump doe n't seem particularly tech savvy'not like say the howard dean campaign of 'but many of the trend driving enthusiasm for him are the product of a new medium world that lack consensus and gatekeeper the rise of talk radio hour cable news and blog are a positive development for those of u who lamented the mainstream medium filter but a david foster wallace observed they also create 'a kind of epistemic free for all in which 'the truth ' is wholly a matter of perspective and agenda when we only had three tv channel there wa a consensus and a shared culture today we have traded that in for individualism atomization and anomie the most recent development in this decade long trend is that the medium ha now become so small d democratic that chance are you can find an outlet that will never challenge your thinking a if it wa tailored just for you and your bias fox news is n't conservative enough for you then check out breitbart is mother jones too moderate for your taste try jacobin if there 's an audience there 's now a medium organization that caters to it'either online or on tv and if all else fails you can just curate a facebook or twitter feed to provide you with all the news and opinion you 're willing to hear in the old day medium gatekeeper were respected and they could have snuffed out a candidate like trump just a few year ago it 'd be impossible to imagine him or any republican candidate surviving the spat he had with fox news this cycle and forget about the mainstream medium stopping trump 's rise seeing how it is now hated by much of the country a candidate like trump can now fully sidestep the gatekeeper he is able to tap into alternative and social medium platform to talk directly to the voter and it doe n't cost him a dime what is more he can introduce and drive narrative and idea that heretofore were considered off limit or 'illegitimate again some of this sound wonderful in theory and in a way it is but tech utopian always learn that every new medium carry with it a double edged sword the decline of belief in institution earlier i talked about how journalist are no longer trusted or respected once upon a time walter cronkite wa revered but the truth is that this decline in respect ha impacted almost every institution ranging from marriage to the church to the federal government and our financial system in the old day people used to join a church forever stay married forever and be loyal to a political party in sickness and in health today we are a free agent nation in some way this is good maybe your party doe n't deserve your loyalty clearly there is a dichotomy between which policy conservative elite believe are proper versus the kind of policy the conservative base want to implement this help candidate like trump who can exploit cynicism by convincing voter that no one ha their back hatred of the other party feed into partisan loyalty but the belief that one ha been sold out by his own party feed into the exact kind of 'outsider ethos a nontraditional candidate like trump would want to foster and so trump get to have it both way he can launch his candidacy because the republican party is too morally and statutorily weak to keep him from running and then he get to turn around and make their weakness and impotence a rationale for his winning but we have also quit respecting authority and this creates specific problem for political party in the old day if the medium did n't squelch a trump bid some political bos in a smoke filled backroom might have today thanks to reform that make thing more transparent and democratic political leader are relatively impotent who need to be loyal to them when outside group can fund a candidate and when anyone with an internet connection can use a social networking platform to raise money by attacking the party boss the decline of value like humility and self sacrifice and respect for expertise and elder we used to respect authority because we had to but we also did it because communitarian value were instilled in u today we live in a much more selfish culture that say you should take whatever you can why bide your time waiting to run for office when you can run for president minute after arriving in the u s senate like ted cruz and barack obama why behave appropriately in the best interest of your party and country when bluster and demagoguery will get you more buzz and money donald trump who ha never been elected to anything and get his foreign policy from 'the show could not flourish in a traditional paradigm where one had to have elected experience or be a high ranking military officer in order to be taken seriously for president today trump 's lack of experience is a feature not a bug in a world where star quarterback go straight from college to starting a quarterback for an nfl team rather than holding someone 's clipboard for a few season it wa only a matter of time before this trend hit politics culture after all is upstream lastly our modern culture revere celebrity and newness trump is a celebrity and it would be hard to discount the impact that this ha had'his instantly universal name recognition his ability to turn out huge crowd etc will he be followed by president oprah or president clooney how would either be any le absurd than president trump a prospect many of u are now taking seriously we also tend to revere what is new and fresh while experience and expertise are now detriment consider this mike huckabee and rick santorum the guy who won the last two iowa caucus are actually doing terribly this time around while ted cruz who wa sworn into elected office for the first time three year ago this month is a top tier candidate this make little sense when you consider that huck and santo are presumably more knowledgeable and better campaigner today but they 're stale in the old day the best way to win the nomination wa to be the guy who ran and lost the last time now we want to believe in magic and they have already demonstrated they ca n't close the deal so we write them off interestingly nearly all of these trend reflect a culture that is anything but conservative what is more at least some of them the lack of humility the lack of respect for experience etc are the product of real cultural degradation the problem with democracy is that you ultimately get what you deserve here 's hoping we swerve matt k lewis is the author of too dumb to fail how the gop betrayed the reagan revolution to win election and how it can

sarah palin she is truly a job creator at least in the world of comedy where palin ha launched thousand of joke and a boutique industry of palin inspired comedy item such a t shirt and pin featuring joke at her expense in fact palin 's speech endorsing donald trump sparked comedy even before she uttered a word a daily show co creator comedian lizz winstead tweeted 'sarah palin would endorse flint water if it would mean getting herself back in the news cycle siriusxm radio host and comedian pete dominick commented shortly before the speech 'nothing ha ever made more sense in politics than sarah palin 's endorsement of donald trump adding 'they have a lot in common including the fact they can both talk for hour without saying anything at all then there wa comedian patton oswalt who launched this tweet upon hearing the news that palin wa endorsing trump 'breaking who give a shit alaskan grifter endorses wo n't win turd clown for president and palin 's speech praising trump did n't disappoint in providing even more comedy for example this palin line should win an award for the most clich expression in one sentence 'i am here because like you i know that it is now or never i 'm in it to win it because we believe in america and we love our freedom but a comedy writer and satirical columnist for the new yorker andy borowitz told me 'how can you 'be in it to win it ' when you are not even running other comedy gem that made u laugh and perhaps made jesus cry included 'how about the rest of u right winging bitter clinging proud clingers of our gun our god and our religion and our constitution and maybe the most quoted line from the speech 'no more pussyfootin ' around it 's not often a politician come out that strongly against pussyfooting but palin pride herself on going 'rogue 'which i think is like going commando during palin 's speech i kept waiting for her to scream out 'live from new york it 's saturday night tina fey ha probably received non stop text and email from friend urging her to get the palin glass out of storage because saturday night live need her twitter certainly wa begging fey to return with people like actor zach braff tweeting 'tina fey is def on snl this weekend but what surprised me wa that by wednesday when i reached out to various comedy writer and comedian their enthusiasm for palin 's return wa more muted than i expected mile kahn former daily show producer and now executive producer of tb 's new show full frontal with samantha bee shrugged it off noting that palin is 'a punchline to a punchline at this point political comedian and long time daily show correspondent lewis black wa also far from jumping for joy over palin 's return rather he wa more philosophical telling me 'with news like this if one can call this news everyday it becomes clearer that we are living at the intersection of reality and satire borowitz who called trump and palin 'rapture ready reality show star noted that even if comedian are excited about palin the reality is she is a 'quitter and could bail at any moment borowitz correctly noted that palin did n't even show up for her first trump rally scheduled for wednesday morning and a few other comedian i approached did n't even want to discus palin because they were over her year ago this is a far cry from when we first met palin with george w bush 's presidency coming to an end comedian were frantically looking for a political figure who could replace him in term of generating material in reality no one ever will many of u then looked to palin who wa like bush but with lipstick but the reality now is that except for a small percentage of republican palin is truly yesterday 's news after all she wa dumped from fox news a a contributor earlier this year and a poll found palin only had about a percent favorability rating among republican among all american her favorable rating is underwater at negative point i doubt many people are actually going to support a candidate just because palin endorses him or her but i will say if you were waiting for palin to tell you who to vote for you should never be allowed to vote again i 'm opposed to voter id law but i now favor voter iq law of course trump 's own internal calculation have led him to conclude that palin add something to his campaign by being on stage with him maybe it make him feel like a genius the big question is will palin help trump in the long run maybe maybe not but while many comedian may have celebrated palin 's return to the national stage with joke on tuesday night it appeared by wednesday thing had changed palin 's name wa no longer trending on social medium a it had on tuesday it had been quickly replaced by the comment of fox news ' current contributor stacey dash who want

frontrunner donald trump is entering his ready for rushmore phase during his appearance monday night on the tonight show starring jimmy fallon'the umpteenth visit the reality television billionaire turned politician ha made to a late night talk show in recent weeks'trump shed the henny youngman shtick of his campaign rally 'take my radical muslim please and metamorphosed into a thoughtful soft spoken unthreatening dignified adult who aspires to occupy the white house 'the people of this country are amazing gushed the thatch roofed candidate who wore his trademark navy suit and red tie accented by the politically necessary american flag lapel pin who knew that the donald had such a sunny personality a he settled into his chair beside fallon 's desk the year old trump looked careworn and tired especially in blotchy closeup he also seemed to be suffering from a case of campaign bloat'a touch of cosmetic credibility for a real estate mogul and medium hound who claim he want to shoulder all the problem of the world and a he like to intone 'make america great again fallon'who got off a couple of mild trump joke during his monologue to wit 'i 'm not saying security is tight but the secret service just put a giant wall around the building and we paid for it 'went easy on his guest 'you 're predictably unpredictable he complimented the candidate '' that 's good trump replied'before asking about trump 's ugly idea to ban all foreign follower of islam from entering the united state 'we 've got to figure out what 's going on trump said repeating his oft stated explanation for imposing an unconstitutional religious test on tourist calling it just a 'temporary measure until the u s government can fathom the 'tremendous hatred that provokes muslim to engage in terrorist attack 'a lot of people agree with me trump declared 'and some people do n't agree with you fallon retorted prompting trump to equably concede the point 'at minimum we 're getting a dialogue started so we can come up with a solution trump said in reasonable sounding soothing tone at another point he played the proud grandpa crowing about the pending third child of pregnant daughter ivanka'the one he once said he could see himself dating if they were n't blood related the candidate'in his previous incarnation a virulent birther who ha never given president obama the benefit of the doubt'repeated his defense of obama 's tear much derided by right wing talking head during the president 's speech last week announcing an executive order to require increased background check for firearm purchase 'i thought that wa heartfelt trump said empathetically 'do you cry ever fallon asked 'yeah when i wa i cried trump answered to laughter trump only brandished his rhetorical switchblade once when fallon asked for his insight into hillary clinton he sounded a theatrically insincere note of concern about the putative democratic frontrunner 's inability to dispatch vermont sen bernie sander who is running neck and neck with her in iowa poll and beating her in his neighboring state of new hampshire 'i think she 's having a tough time trump said in a woeful tone 'he should be easy to beat how can you lose like this he is n't even a democrat he say he 's a socialist'and maybe a step beyond socialist 'i thought i heard you say something that bill campaigning for her is not a smart idea fallon said 'time will tell trump replied 'she came out with a little bit of a statement about me and i came out with a very big statement about her and bill and she stopped talking about me all of a sudden he gloated to laughter from the studio audience member of which alternately cheered and snickered at the candidate 's assertion 'it 's gon na be interesting to see what happens trump mused 'i think it 's gon na be one of the most interesting race and they actually said if i win a poll came out if i win and she win it 's going to be the largest voter turnout in the history of the country and that 's a good thing because people do n't vote that much in this country fallon asked jokingly about the 'conspiracy theory that the democratic party hired trump to run for president so that clinton would win 'i 'll set the record straight right now trump answered 'the newest poll just came out today where i 'm beating her easily and substantially and i 'm winning against hillary one on one and i have n't even started on her yet although last week i did a little bit 'a reference to his attack on former president clinton for quadrennially revived allegation of sexual misconduct and even rape 'but we have n't even started this wa uttered in a casual tone of lighthearted bonhomie and almost sounded pleasant unlike his previous appearance with fallon trump did n't participate in a comedy sketch'which probably would come off a unhelpfully unpresidential at this stage of the game'but he did submit to a supposedly rib tickling fake job interview in his second segment with fallon adopting an officious mien to read question off a clipboard q 'tell me a little about yourself a 'well i 'm an extraordinarily handsome person i have a beautiful head of hair i wa always a good student i always worked hard q 'do you have a weakness a it 's 'that i never forget which is sort of interesting i 'm too nice too long'and when somebody take advantage of a situation i 'm too bad too long q 'is medium attention something you would be comfortable with a 'not at all i 'd be very very uncomfortable it almost seemed a he continues to confound the political establishment and throw the republican party into disarray that trump get the joke,18277.0

image making released in starring gene kelly and debbie reynolds it captured the singing dancing 'that 's entertainment essence of american escapism and now some year later it 's been revived on stage in paris where appreciation for thing made in the usa or at least the french notion of them is running very strong indeed for the past year the th tre du ch telet built more than year ago in the heart of paris ha been presenting american musical classics'in english'as stage production for french audience and watching a broadway style musical at the th tre du ch telet is quite an experience it 's a little like going to the opera but audience swing in their seat and tap their foot the grand some would say grandiose theater inaugurated under the reign of the emperor napoleon iii ha a huge stage elaborate set and a full orchestra and ch telet director jean luc choplin say the the theater 's mission is to be 'sophisticated and popular the formula ha worked elaborate show prepared by world class director choreographer and artist have been drawing in crowd since choplin arrived in but the focus on american english language production wa not at first an easy sell when choplin broached the idea ten year ago he wa told the show would flop for sure he took that a a challenge 'when someone tell you something wo n't work you set out to prove them wrong and you defend what you believe in choplin told the daily beast and so he did the first production wa rather slyly 'candide which is voltaire of course by way of leonard berstein choplin then went on to produce more american broadway musical including 'west side story 'on the town 'a little night music 'my fair lady 'the king and i 'into the wood ' all to sold out audience what set the th tre du ch telet 's production apart from many on broadway said choplin is their sheer size each original production is worthy of the world 's opera house with up to musician in the orchestra pit dozen more on stage for the company number and several dozen more backstage 'we gave nobility to musical comedy like an opera said choplin 'there wa a certain snobbishness toward 'entertainment ' but i knew that a show doe n't have to be boring to be good one can have beautiful music a good story a certain lightness and be universal putting it another way choplin call the show 'haute couture musical comedy 'it wa a revolution he say 'we take the mainstream population seriously we 're not going to serve them taco but smoked salmon and caviar the crowning glory of jean luc choplin 's venture into american musical so far wa christopher wheeldon 's stage version of 'an american in paris adapted from the original hollywood film starring gene kelly and leslie caron with vintage music by george gershwin 'i got rhythm 'our love is here to stay the story take place soon after world war ii when a young america gi turned wannabe painter living hand to mouth in montmartre meet a mysterious girl who unbeknownst to him is loved by his good friend the stage version 's world premiere wa at the th tre du ch telet in november before it opened in april on broadway where it racked up four tonys including best choreography and three outer critic circle award including 'outstanding new broadway musical and now come 'singin ' in the rain here in france with bubbly advertising visible all over town on the front of city bus if 'an american in paris wa a caricature of the expat artist in a stylized montmartre the movie 'singin ' in the rain wa a brilliant send up of hollywood energy extravagance and incoherence in the heyday of silent movie the same period we saw recently in the oscar winner 'the artist lina lamott is a glamorous movie star but behind the scene she is churlish and insecure her costar don lockwood who claim to have always lived with 'dignity is also perpetrating a myth one might say it 's a metaphor for the way the french sometimes view america shiny on the surface but deeply flawed if you peek beneath year ago in the s when i wa a student teacher in paris the topic of poverty and food stamp in america came up during a class discussion the high schoolers i wa teaching did not believe that poverty existed in america 'but all american are rich one student insisted my assurance to him and the class that this wa not the case wa met with skepticism and the mythical image of american seen by the french doe n't stop at wealth after all we produced fred astaire gene kelly john wayne elvis chuck berry gibson guitar harley davidsons hell angel and yes jerry lewis'all icon embraced one way or the other on this side of the atlantic one french idol who ha kept the american myth alive is the die hard septuagenarian rocker johnny hallyday he ha been featured for year on the page of the magazine paris match riding through the american west on his harley now hallyday is still giving concert and publishing autobiography his latest book the promised land is about yes his travel through the united state meanwhile the hard news that reach france from america is often about violence and what seems to the french to be political madness the heroic wild west image of america ha morphed into the impression that every man woman and child in the u s is toting a semi automatic in fact since world war ii the relationship between france and america ha often been 'je t'aime moi non plus i love you me neither the french loved american for liberating them from the nazi but in the year that followed america wa the target of criticism for everything from rampant commercialism to invading iraq a little like the fictional lina lamott in 'singin ' in the rain we were supposed to be uncultured ill mannered and have 'no history because ' year of history is equivalent to none i have actually been told this by more than one french person the ch telet musical produced over the last decade have been not least reminder to the french of how much energy and excitement are still associated with the united state and over the last year a the french and american have found themselves facing the common terrorist enemy there 's been more than ever a willingness to embrace what may be real affinity or at least comforting myth about each other immediately following the november terrorist attack in paris people were afraid to go out but it did n't last most french and parisian are giving the proverbial 'bras d'honneur 'up yours to the terrorist saying 'you wo n't stop u from living eating at caf s and watching show in which our sole purpose is to enjoy music laugh and have fun a it happened rehearsal for 'singin ' in the rain were to start at the theater that same weekend of the attack they were delayed by a few day following the full dress rehearsal just day after the slaughter the orchestra played 'la marseillaise and the mostly english cast and audience sang together it wa not just defiance people who were there told the daily beast but community solidarity support for art music joy love a retired french couple who had never been to the th tre du ch telet despite their many decade in paris went to 'singin ' in the rain early last month madame wa a huge fan of the hollywood movie which she admitted to having watched multiple time they loved the show but monsieur had what he thought wa a more pressing question 'what do you think of your president he asked u s president barack obama is far more popular in france approval rating in the percent range than he is in the u s under percent and the french do n't understand american do n't love him a they do but these sort of misunderstanding can be met with a classic gallic shrug we have long since moved away from the abysmal day of slinging insult like 'cheese eating surrender monkey and 'hamburger eating imbecile american know that french food is outstanding and the french these day also love a good american burger in point of fact it 's hard to find a bistro or caf in paris now that doe n't feature a gastronomic cheeseburger on it menu our culture are intertwined in so many way and since november with a little inspiration from an old movie turned into a new musical the french have been 'laughing at cloud so dark up above they 're just singin ' in the rain,6900.0

husband of fallen police officer moira smith 'i invite you to come to the national memorial and museum and see for yourself and perhaps learn something about the value of new yorkers and the hero who defended american value on september th the remark in question accompanied cruz 's suggestion that donald trump play 'new york new york rather than 'born in the usa at campaign rally 'because donald come from new york and he embodies new york value cruz then said should cruz now accept the invitation he will see the name moira smith among those of hundred of others who truly did embody new york value and therefore american value a famous photograph taken on show moira smith leading a bleeding executive to safety from the south tower the year old cop then returned to direst danger and is credited with saving hundred of life another surviving executive would remember the evenness of her voice and the steadiness of her eye a she kept people moving when they otherwise would have frozen

real emotion about watching the tower come down he said he had visited ground zero following the attack and by all report he had 'the cleanup began the next day he now said a a proud new yorker but in his choice of word trump wa trump whose value are only his own what began even before the second tower came down wa the rescue effort followed not by a cleanup but a month long recovery effort the

the boy 's right hand bruising on his neck a contusion on his lower back the outline of his rib could be seen his abdomen wa 'soft and sunken white determined paz had died of starvation this wa a homicide except to the chicago police department who ha never referred to paz a a homicide victim spokesman anthony guglielmi told the daily beast that their case on paz is a 'death investigation centered around some child neglect issue detective would like to speak to the boy 's father guglielmi added but the man fled the country following his son 's death the father could be a far away a colombia where he returned from with an emaciated and dying son in late june 'we are working with federal partner to find the father guglielmi said it 's unclear what the father would have to say for chicago police to officially consider paz 's death a homicide a confession certainly would n't hurt but where do you draw the line between intentional neglect and bad parenting one thing is clear the medical evidence is irrefutable paz did not die by natural causes'far from it the young boy starved to death chicago police count homicide in on it website four short of the noted in response to a freedom of information act by the daily beast some observer count a many a homicide and others a few a the discrepancy between those number and cpd 's are more difficult to pin down but the foia request also sought the name and other identifying information of those victim making the task a bit easier the medical examiner 's office is the best place to begin when seeking the precise number of those killed in chicago in a given year the office performed autopsy that were classified a homicide in a separate foia request revealed that mean in there were at least death classified a a homicide that did not make the cpd 's official count many of those who were listed a homicide victim by the medical examiner but not by police were victim of past gun violence more than people were shot in chicago last year ' a number is shocking but also down significantly from the ravage of the crack era every year men and woman who were shot a long a a decade ago die a a result from these injury tracking them down and checking their name off the list of homicide listed by the medical examiner but not police result in a tour of the city 's nursing home one by one week by week that 's what took up this past summer 's day between the gunshot victim of year past and the accidental or justifiable death the number kept getting smaller i whittled the number down from more than two dozen to ten

come from a three page police report and white 's six page autopsy report no birth announcement no obituary no remembrance of him on the block where he died the name of paz 's mother and father are blacked out on the incident report provided by the police department all we know is that both have disappeared since the july morning when the year old wa brought to the hospital where he eventually died that previous night the mother told police paz 's father brought the boy home saying he 'could not take care of their son anymore an officer wrote after living with the child for some time in colombia the father returned his son to mom who became upset that paz looked malnourished she fed paz a hot dog and fry according to the report it wa the child 's simple and very american last meal just after midnight the mother checked on paz and found him 'foaming at the mouth and unresponsive the report state much of the information about paz 's mother is up to speculation but anyone who ha read more than a few police report can easily fill in the blank 'mother related that she is a redacted patient and wa admitted to mercy hospital a few week ago she also stated that she is a redacted

golden globe award well what 's your problem you whiney cunt that 's just one choice phrase gervais ha for critic of his hosting performance in a series of tweet tuesday afternoon the comedian took to twitter to explain and defend some of his controversial joke especially one about caitlyn jenner 's transition that some argued wa transphobic and to ridicule those who were offended by his comedy 'if joke caused the easily offended to bleed internally i 'd do more standup gervais tweeted tuesday afternoon one of roughly a dozen post addressing his award performance haters'all mixed in with tribute to david bowie and a photo of his cat at least two attempted to directly explain the joke he made about jenner and why he doe n't believe it is transphobic another read 'suggesting a joke about caitlin sic jenner is automatically transphobic is like suggesting a joke about bill cosby is automatically racist in the middle of it all he retweeted a news article with the headline 'ricky gervais really doe n't care if you 're offended by his joke that gervais made headline for pushing the envelope with his comedy at sunday 's golden globe is no surprise that 's the comedian 's brand and in fact offense is something he promised in the lead up to the award 'better get dressed and offend some humorless cunt i suppose he tweeted before the ceremony what is unusual however is this aggressive social medium pushback against those who were scandalized by what he said and criticized him for it a comedian known for pushing button doe n't normally insult or explain himself to people when their button are pushed a planned occasionally you 'll see an apology come from the like of amy schumer or sarah silverman when a joke may cross the line though typically a raunchy comedian will let their edgier joke just hang there for debate it 's part of what they do provoke what they do n't do launch what amount to a veritable tirade against critic of their performance explain their joke and react in such a loud and unapologetic way to people who did n't like what they said the crux of the controversy sprouted from gervais ' opening monologue a vicious series of randy barb designed to make the celebrity in attendance squirm and clutch their pearl and in the age of social medium make those at home take to twitter with their hashtag outrage while arguably offensive'because everything is offensive in this day and age the age of offense'many of his joke were smart critique that cut so sharp because they were true his bit about equal pay in hollywood especially many were politically incorrect but still funny because they were smart others were politically incorrect but also lazy'like his caitlyn jenner joke hence the controversy 'i 've changed he said 'not a much a bruce jenner obviously 'now caitlyn jenner of course he went on 'what a year she 's had she became a role model for trans people everywhere showing great bravery in breaking down barrier and destroying stereotype she did n't do a lot for woman driver but you ca n't have everything not at the same time immediately twitter took him task calling the bit transphobic they also were n't too pleased with his riff on jeffrey tambor trying to conceal his scrotum while playing a trans woman in transparent speaking to buzzfeed at the ceremony transparent creator jill soloway said 'i know his thing is to make fun of everything but i think if more people understood the violence trans people face every day it would be harder to make joke about it were the joke transphobic gervais certainly did n't think so though many social activist and lgbt site did taking gervais to task for it being generous to gervais they were at best lazy and tired beginning a longer bit with a punchline suggesting that it is inherently funny that a man would want to transition into a woman is a cheap and dated laugh and that 's what he went for with the joke about jenner taken to task about that on twitter by u k huffington post writer rachel mcgrath gervais argued that the joke wa n't about jenner 's transition but about her fatal car accident and therefore wa not a mcgrath accused 'transphobic after two tweet that directly addressed mcgrath 's criticism gervais tweeted 'i made a joke about caitlyn jenner killing someone in her car i 'm transportphobic e b white once said'and we understand the preposterousness of evoking e b white in a piece about ricky gervais '' explaining a joke is like dissecting a frog you understand it better but the frog dy in the process speaking in term of comedy whether or not there wa reason to be offended by gervais at the globe there 's a danger in defending a joke insisting that it wa funny to those who you think 'just did n't get it or reducing yourself to explaining the joke it patronizes an audience making it seem that they are not intelligent enough to understand your comedy and when you are a comedian whose entire act rest on a giddy embrace of off color content that you even say is meant to offend people attacking those who were offended threatens your integrity a a performer'at least in this critic 's opinion it seems hypocritical to intend to offend and then to be annoyed when people take offense a we mentioned before it 's not uncommon for a comedian to apologize for a controversial joke a schumer silverman and countless other comedian have done'though we 'd argue that threatens a comedian 's integrity in a different way but it seems particularly noteworthy that a comedian like gervais who at the tail end of his series of tweet posted 'outrage is the comedian 's alchemy would confuse an insecure shaming of critic and pandering tutorial on the merit of his joke for an apologetic endorsement of his controversial statement this is n't an argument for censorship no topic should be off limit and no venue should be absolved from the kind of edgy and provocative comedy that gervais is known for when he 's on his game provocation cause discussion and discussion is essential in shifting cultural attitude and mores'whether offense is the catalyst for that discussion or otherwise so gervais wa extremely correct in one point in this series of tweet 'you have every right to be offended just do n't cry when no one cared call me crazy but after spending an hour dissecting roughly tweet gervais posted on the topic it certainly seems like he care in what appears to be at least for now his final word on the topic gervais posted a photo of himself with angel wing giving the middle finger 'do n't offended people realise they are doing my marketing for me he wrote maybe but now more than ever they may be unsure of what brand they 're marketing,26526.0

ashley ann olsen wa killed the body of the year old florida native wa found last saturday by her artist boyfriend in the small studio apartment she rented in central florence she wa nude except for her sock her neck wa covered with lesion and bruise police recovered a usb cable several black plastic tie and a handful of necklace a part of their cache of forensic evidence for four day forensic police scoured hour of surveillance tape from the neighborhood where olsen lived interviewed dozen of her friend and neighbor and interrogated her boyfriend at length they eventually settled on the theory that the american hooked up with cheik tidiane diaw a year old undocumented immigrant from senegal at a seedy nightclub apparently they were right official say they confirmed his involvement when diaw 's dna wa found in a condom and on a cigarette in olsen 's apartment 'they had consensual sex lead prosecutor giuseppe creazzo said matter of factly at a press conference thursday morning before laying out his theory that olsen wa knocked out somehow when she hit her head and diaw likely unintentionally strangled her when he tried to revive her she had two fracture in her cranium and multiple lesion on her neck 'they were n't exactly lucid he said though he said he would wait until the toxicology report were in to elaborate creazzo also ruled out earlier theory investigator floated about a 'sex game gone wrong 'there are no trace of an erotic game he said implying that sex that could potentially cause a cranial fracture if that 's what happened wa somehow normal diaw may choose to enlighten investigator to exactly how it happened that olsen died but it may be much harder to sort out why they ended up together in the first place wa it a case of revenge sex olsen had a boyfriend and wa n't known to pick up men according to what her friend told police granted olsen and her boyfriend did have a fight but they had n't apparently broken up and by the reaction and grief her boyfriend exhibited by giving mouth to mouth to her corpse in an attempt to bring her back to life there appeared to still be feeling at least from his side or wa it more a mr goodbar case referring to the s movie in which theresa dunn a well behaved schoolteacher seek out increasingly risky sexual experience to combat boredom if that is the case it certainly did n't end well for m dunn either investigator said olsen and diaw were seen by several witness chatting at the montecarla nightclub a famed hookup spot for florentine they were also reportedly caught on surveillance tape walking together in the direction from the club toward olsen 's house no direct camera were pointed at olsen 's door and the camera at the club entrance wa out of order but it would appear they entered her apartment together with her opening the door willingly the montecarla feature what amount to private area with large bedlike couch and seating space and plenty of jungle d cor it ha been closed at least once in the last year after charge that it abetted the sale of cocaine olsen 's friend say they left her there around a m friday creazzo say she wa killed a few hour after that no official transcript of diaw 's interrogation ha been released but local press have quoted investigator saying that diaw apparently partially confessed when confronted with the evidence of his dna in olsen 's apartment pleading that he had n't meant to kill her and that he did n't know she wa dead when he left other report have stated that diaw said he pushed her which is how she cracked her skull and then tried to revive her by grabbing her necklace theory abound but nothing ha been confirmed so far whatever happened and with what intent diaw most certainly compromised any sympathy he might have otherwise garnered by the fact that he snatched her cellphone when he left and replaced her sim card with his own using the dead woman 's phone until his arrest according to police his status a an undocumented immigrant will also do little to help him since entering italy illegally is also a crime if he came by boat during the recent wave of migration to europe he should have been fingerprinted and processed but apparently he wa not his brother however is living legally in the country what happens next depends entirely on what diaw and his yet to be determined legal team decide to do he could try to enter a plea bargain and opt for a fast track trial that would be held behind closed door and would save olsen 's family from what must surely be an unimaginably difficult time a they hear allegation of their daughter and sister 's behavior without the benefit or comfort of ever hearing her own side of the story or he could fight the charge and drag this sad story through a public trial which would only prolong the misery of this tragic event for everyone,49679.0

is going directly to the donald j trump foundation'an organization that ha given more to the clinton than to the troop trump 's campaign launched donaldtrumpforvets com today in advance of his showy counter event in iowa during the republican debate the site featuring the image of a ukrainian actor posing a a soldier promise that ' of your donation will go directly to veteran need yet clearly marked in the top left corner is the gold emblem of the donald j trump foundation and at the bottom a small disclosure read 'the donald j trump foundation is a c nonprofit organization a of around pm the site claim that it ha raised in it le than day old existence trump 's campaign wo n't say which particular group will reap the now quarter of a million dollar windfall though and the tax form that show how he spends the money wo n't be public until when asked about the particular organization that would benefit campaign spokesperson katrina pierson told cnn that 'there might be a list on the website after initially claiming that she could not hear the question 'there are a lot of organization that are in queue to sign up for this no such list is currently available on the site and the campaign did not respond to a request for clarification from the daily beast it doe n't appear that veteran are jumping at the opportunity to collect money from the gop frontrunner the iraq and afghanistan veteran of america a prominent group that represents some veteran already said they do not want a cent raised in relation to trump 's event 'if offered iava will decline donation from trump 's event founder and ceo paul rieckhoff tweeted yesterday 'we need strong policy from candidate not to be used for political stunt trump 's foundation also ha a history of giving paltry donation to organization benefiting veteran while doling out enormous sum to the wwe various evangelical and political organization a well a the clinton foundation tax form examined by the daily beast show that in the donald j trump foundation gave a whopping to the clinton foundation then called the william j clinton foundation the following year trump 's foundation a registered c group gave another to the clinton foundation topping this off wa a hefty gift of to world wrestling entertainment a company for which trump ha made appearance in the past over a five year span from to the foundation gave just to veteran ' group according to an estimate forbes made last december a significant portion of that come from a single donation in to the fisher house which help provide home to veteran and their family while essentially shafting charity benefiting veteran the foundation wa far more open handed with conservative political group and religious charity this includes a contribution in to generation rescue an organization created by actress jenny mccarthy that spread scientifically inaccurate information about the link between vaccine and autism the foundation 's tax form also show that it gave to the billy graham evangelistic association in that same year it gave a comparatively paltry to the hero to hero foundation a group that help veteran with ptsd beyond the financial contribution to religious organization it seems that the trump foundation wa also trying to curry favor with shadowy political outfit the foundation gave in to the drumthwacket foundation which help maintain the new jersey governor 's mansion'and is dogged by charge that donor use it to curry favor with whoever is the state 's current governor in this instance fellow presidential candidate chris christie the difference between financial contribution to veteran ' group and political organization are enormous in some case in trump 's foundation gave to friend of veteran inc and to the marine corp law enforcement foundation that same year it dumped on the american conservative union foundation'boosting the group that host the annual conservative cpac confab a ha been the case with trump 's politics his foundation ha also waffled allegiance granting contribution to charity with diametrically opposed interest for example in it gave to the iowa family leader foundation'boosting a group dogmatically opposed to same sex marriage but the year before it gave to the gay lesbian and straight education network so regardless of your view on gay right the trump foundation ha backed some group you should find extremely upsetting and the organization ha always kept it friend close in it gave to the american spectator foundation'a foundation backing a small conservative magazine whose contributing editor jeffrey lord is one of the most reliably pro trump voice on cable news above and beyond his giving priority trump himself ha a le than admirable record on veteran ' issue the closest he ever came to military service wa being a cadet at a military academy in the early s where he earned a medal for cleanliness when a real war in vietnam broke out trump wa of prime age to be drafted'but ducked service multiple time while trump wa busy studying john mccain wa getting tortured by his captor in north vietnam refusing an offer to return to the u s early trump later said that the fact that trump got captured meant he wa n't a real hero and if openly insulting all pow everywhere wa n't enough trump ha also lobbied hard in the past to keep disabled veteran from being street vendor near his trump tower so a trump try to brand himself a a noble hero for the blue blooded american cause of veteran his foundation ha an extensive history of shafting the very people who he is now using a political puppet not only ha his charitable arm not reached the hand of people coming back from war it ha instead lined the pocket of political interest like the clinton against whom trump

1,9544391.0,2016-01-01T05:01:00+00:00,why everybody should work in hollywood,i 'm convinced that working in hollywood is the most effective and efficient way to teach people how to work you have to work well under constant pressure you have to be responsible for more thing than anyone should have to be responsible for and you have to be cunning i 've worked in the development and production of major motion picture and television then switched over to working in content at an advertising agency and now work a a creative director at a medium company but in all my travel the most incredible worker were those who got their start in the film television biz when i think about the thing that make me good at my job i can trace them back to what i learned being at the bottom of the food chain in hollywood and fighting my way up here 's what i learned there is no other option if you are n't good with your time and you ca n't stay organized you 'll never make it in this town it 's too fast there 's too much happening and it 's too demanding you are in the office before your bos and stay long after you are the manager and keeper of every aspect of their life ' their schedule their call their project their meeting and yes their personal stuff i had a bos who expected me to make sure their car wa always filled with gas if they ever left the studio and did n't have enough gas to get where they were going it wa my fault i had to occasionally ask for their key go to their studio spot turn on their car check for the level and drive to the gas station if it wa low and pray i did n't crash the car i knew another assistant who had to always drive their bos to a waxing appointment because they wanted to take a xanax another had to take their bos 's online traffic school for them when they got a ticket you are their keeper of their life and their secret and because you 're busy managing their life your life take a backseat i would forget thing like friend ' birthday or to pay bill on top of that i also read every incoming script so i 'd get in an additional two hour early to make sure i could knock two out before i even started my regular day i suffered in my first hollywood assistant gig because everything took me longer than the other assistant at the studio i pride myself at being an organized person but i did n't grasp the kind of organized my bos needed me to be ' it wa their office not mine not only is there just so much to do and keep track of you need to learn to do it their way i tried all sort of method to help this bos stay organized until we finally came to the conclusion that maybe we just were n't a match our personality were too different and i wa too far down the spiral to be able to pick myself up and come back i felt defeated it wa heartbreaking i had always been reliable smart efficient and well wanted and here i wa a lowly assistant whose duty i thought i should be able to easily master questioning my work ethic but it did make me better i wa more prepared to deal with job it wa a fresh start and i went in eye open on learning how to work with a specific kind of personality how to deliver on unique expectation and how to stop negative thinking affect my work i wa a machine at my next job and while that one had a new set of challenge i am still astounded at how much i got done each day when i moved into other role at adjacent industry i wa shocked to see such poor follow through great idea flowed but the hustle and accountability lacked when you 're dealing with the desperation and starvation when it come to hollywood dream people will do whatever it take to get those dream actualized i learned that i wa the only one responsible for making thing happen and no one wa going to do that but me by climbing the ladder of success producing a film or getting a project off the ground i realized the ability to just get thing done wa an invaluable skill you have to constantly make decision and quickly and not fuck up should i interrupt bos in their current meeting that they told me not to interrupt them for but if i do n't they 'll lose out on this script high profile celebrity is scheduled for a dinner with bos and when you confirmed the reservation the restaurant did n't have it and now what should i tell bos they have some personal message on the answering machine when there 's a very graphic one a friend sent and if i tell them we 'll both know i heard it but if i do n't will they not get it every day constantly exhaustively there are choice to be made some important some not so much except in hollywood it 's all important because when you fuck up in hollywood it make your life so much more miserable than any other industry because there 's no room for mistake they are unforgivable the irony the only way to learn how not to fuck up is to fuck up but you also make other decision a lot faster ' about yourself while your peer dawdle for month or year figuring out what they 're good at or what they love the pressure cooker of hollywood speed up that process for you because you 're constantly fucking up you figure out quickly how to not fuck up since you 're feeling the wrath of fucking up all the time you learn about what kind of bos you want to be in the future or in my case what kind of bos i absolutely did n't want to be and because you figure out what you do and no not want to put up with you make choice about the career you want the work that interest you and the thing in your life that matter a lot faster i once got my dream job ' or rather what i thought wa my dream job except i wa in tear every night because my bos at the time wa such an awful human and made my life miserable but that misery taught me a lot the biggest is that i now have a 'no asshole policy it doe n't matter the work or the job i now only work with people i enjoy spending time with and for boss i like and respect you have to learn every agent 's name and the name of their assistant of the week you need to know who the current hot writer are their entire body of work and you better have read it all too you need to remember who 'the people are of the celebrity you work with manager agent pr rep etc their kid ' name their birthday and their blood type you need to know everyone 's name on set and have their contact information at the ready the point is you need to remember volume and volume of information and i do n't mean just have google at the ready ' you need to be ready when your bos asks you you have le than a second to respond no time for you to go digging through your phone or notebook you just have to know and you know what you get pretty good at it i did i became a sponge i learned all those name and kept track of who wa moving to other agency or studio when i worked on set i made a mini version of the crew list and callsheets laminated them and kept them on a key ring around my neck i wa always ready for whatever information i needed to conjure up in a moment and i still have a reputation for being a steel trap i trained my brain to be like that and it 's served me incredibly well because of the pace of life the pressure cooker the harsh hour the personality you learn to be detailed and get to the point bos ca n't be expected to remember everything that 's your job ' see previous point and ha better thing to do than talk to you so you are always detailed in your communication you do n't just say 'your pm is here the standard time for a hollywood lunch you say 'your pm lunch with high profile celebrity is just pulling up to the lot so they 're about five minute out and i 've laid out lunch in the conference room and yes no mayo you do n't just say you 're almost done with script coverage you say you 're almost done with 'x script that came in tuesday by big writer and y script by lesser known writer that came in today and everyone is talking about it so they 'll have coverage for both by pm there is no room for follow up question that will annoy bos or for speech and if they 're asking about something you 've already failed you fucked up i had a bos that would tell me five time a day 'constant update and i have their voice in my head to this day they wanted to know exactly what wa happening with everything throughout the day and if they had to ask they were pissed i needed to be on the ready and find the moment throughout the day to proactively update them speaking of being proactive it 's the game changer in all of this on my first internship i watched in awe a efficient assistant would organize something because they saw a need for it on top of their mountain of work without being asked i know that sound pretty basic but it wa a great lesson to learn so young you were n't going to get anywhere by doing just what 's asked of you ' you need to step it up because this is hollywood and we 're all starving so be better than the person next to you be indispensable and be proactive when it come to making your bos and everyone else at the company 's life better see what need fixing and just fix it i apply the same skill in a senior role when it come to growing a team growing a business and making thing better and more efficient it 's also the only way you 're going to get promoted out of that assistant role ' the only thing that matter you 'll put up with screamer

his father had done to me davenport said camilla said 'all of you going around and talking about it doe create awareness'it 's so important that people like yourselves speak up otherwise we gloss over

be their party 's nominee leaf the center lane wide open for an independent candidate inside the beltway where cynicism often pass for wisdom the notion is dismissed out of hand a a fool 's errand there 's no question there are high barrier to entry for an independent presidential campaign but they are surmountable for a self funded candidate with executive government experience which is why former three term new york city mayor mike bloomberg 's look at an independent presidential run is worth taking seriously'and why he can afford to wait a few month to see whether bernie and trump are the nominee bloomberg 's explored this option before back in he backed a study about the viability of a third party run but when mccain and obama locked up their nomination with post partisan appeal against the establishment of their two party the centrist space looked locked up instead the work wa discretely repacked into a useful book declaring independence by doug schoen which laid out the history of third party candidate analyzed the ideological divide and offered strategy to overcome ballot access block the ballot access is perhaps the most serious obstacle and aide have told bloomberg he need to decide by march but if the key question is whether bernie and trump will be their party 's nominee amid a drawn out delegate fight the final answer might not be available until april luckily the state deadline for an independent presidential candidate to get on the ballot are further out in the calendar than the deadline for a new presidential party according to data put together by richard winger at ballot access news a new party 's deadline for ballot access begin in march but for an independent presidential candidate the ballot access deadline do n't start kicking in until may texas and state have deadline in august or september that 's why bloomberg could wait until later than march to make a final decision it 's still a logistical hurdle and even if he make the ballot he 'll have to fight to qualify for the debate all of which is why a credible candidate with the ability to self fund is essential and bloomberg is apparently willing to put a billion dollar of his estimated billion on the table to the delight of consultant and consternation of citizen concerned about the influence of big money in politics but bloomberg basically invented donald trump 's riff about wealth making him independent of lobbyist and any associated corruption new york billionaire overlap aside i said this wa an especially weird year bloomberg 's politics fit the center much better than the donald 's anti immigrant demagoguery and the argument for a bloomberg run remains strong if ted cruz is the nominee broadly speaking bloomberg is fiscally conservative and socially liberal'and that 's the still unmet sweet spot in american politics yes that open him to attack from the right that he 's too anti gun and pro public health a k a the nanny state there will also be attack from the left that he 's too close to wall street and an advocate of stop and frisk but there is clearly a constituency for a candidate with effective executive government experience who is tough on crime and excessive debt but belief in the right to choose and the virtue of immigration whether mexican or muslim it 's no wonder that trump face a negative deficit among independent voter beltway insider and partisan pundit will go blue in the face trying to dismiss the idea that there is any constituency for independent candidate but a couple of macro fact offer a reality check forty four percent of american now identify a independent voter compared to democrat and republicans'that 's up from rough parity a decade ago and almost double the number of independent when ross perot ran in 'during a time in which the two party have flat lined there are now state where registered independents'or non affiliated voters'outnumber democrat or republican this includes the first caucus state of iowa and the first primary state of new hampshire and the ultimate swing state of florida the fact that this ha happened a the two party have become more polarized is not a coincidence finally nearly of american say they 'd like to see a third party option on the ballot the point is not that mike bloomberg is the perfect independent presidential candidate'he 's absent anything resembling a populist streak'but he 's the most experienced possible candidate with the ability to self fund this is also his last possible rodeo'he 'll be in february at the outset of this cycle he might have assumed that hillary and jeb or christie would be sucking up all the oxygen in the centrist space but the gop seems to have murdered it center right and while a recent morning consult poll showed bloomberg playing a spoiler role against trump and clinton which make sense given bloomberg 's broad overlap with hillary 's political profile the poll notably left bernie off the three way match up bottom line in the unlikely event that sander and trump are the nominee after a drawn out delegate fight an independent bloomberg campaign would be a form of civic service for the moderate

artist formerly known a mo def really is done'done with making music and film done with voicing his creativity for the public done with contributing to the landscape of hip hop'then we should all be saddened we should be saddened that an industry is n't more conducive to nurturing the best of our creator we should be saddened that a culture stifled that creativity to the point that he had to seek peace via nomadic existence we should be saddened that an art form did n't value him more and we should do a much a we can to ensure that this generation of high profile black creatives do n't get so frustrated with the industry and their audience that they too decide the best solution is to walk away when i wa a young man in the late ' s i thought of mo def similarly to the way a generation of hip hop fan view kendrick lamar now he wa passionate and thoughtful he could rhyme his as off and black on both side wa an album that blew me away from the very first listen i would start my day with 'umi say playing in the background and ride to work blasting 'ms fat booty and 'mathematics mo def became quieter and quieter in hip hop a year passed seemingly finding more solace in acting and activism a a new generation of thoughtful emcee ha emerged maybe the weight of yasiin bey walking away wo n't be immediately felt maybe he 'd been gone for a long time already and this just made it official we do n't know all that ha happened and is happening to him a he embarks on his unorthodox personal journey and it may not be for u to know but contemporary black culture is better when mo def is a part of it here 's hoping yasiin bey find his way home,26342.0

four professional service organization and what doe she hope to accomplish now 'i come from generation of artist and actor who are fantastic and wonderful but they 're all really thrilled that i can just balance a checkbook let alone work somewhere like ey she say with a laugh 'my parent were really kind of determined to get me out of acting they wanted a child with anything but an acting career

home on winter break she auditioned for a friend of the family and landed the lead role in invasion a horror science fiction movie telling the story of a small town overtaken by an alien plague on the

studying it and reading it over and over again and finding the thing that someone else could n't see that 's the best part of acting that 's how you get a part in acting is to find a unique take on

that is the metaphor that vice president biden is embracing a he put the piece in place to carry out the mission given him by the president for their final year in office there could n't be a more welcome assignment for biden the father who lost his year old son to brain cancer last year and for biden the public servant who lamented when he withdrew from the presidential race that he had hoped to be the president who cured cancer in the run up to that decision biden 's friend and longtime aide former senator ted kaufman asked him this core question what is it you would want to do a president one of the issue that came up wa cancer kaufman told the daily beast that when beau biden wa first diagnosed in the vice president reacted 'like any parent wa obsessed with trying to help his son through this he talked to dozen of people anybody who could help ' and over that period he accumulated a lot of knowledge about the present state of play around cancer in this country biden say a cancer moon shot is much bigger than his son but where beau 's illness wa the driving force it wa all that time spent with doctor their assurance of hope their confidence that better treatment were on the horizon that influenced biden 'in constant meeting with doctor he saw the much bigger scope of what could be done kaufman say 'he really felt if beau life another six month even that he felt thing could be better'months not year this holding out of hope perhaps false hope is familiar to anyone who ha navigated the world of cancer the late steve job talked of 'making it to the next lily pad in his effort to outdistance the disease my late husband fought metastatic kidney cancer for almost five year before it spread to his brain and killed him the clinical trial he took part in showed promise based on animal testing and he marveled at the many mouse out there who were cured human not so much tom died almost eleven year ago and he wa on the cutting edge then of immunotherapy he called it 'shake and bake because the drug that marshaled his immune system to fight the cancer caused flu like symptom with bone racking chill and then fever a high a degree he often said the treatment felt worse than the disease a lot of progress ha been made in this area even in the last five year and biden say he 's looking for 'quantum leap he belief we 're on the precipice of real breakthrough in immunotherapy and genomics that will take cancer treatment far beyond the blunt instrument of chemotherapy and radiation therapy at davos last week biden met with cancer expert from around the world and said 'our goal is to make a decade 's worth of advance in five year instead of and eventually end cancer a we know it we 're not looking for incremental change i 'm looking for quantum leap national institute of health director francis collins who credit biden with working with congress to increase the nih budget to the highest it 's been in a decade called the vice president 'delightfully unplugged a he made his cancer moon shot center stage at the davos gathering of global leader in the week since president obama tapped him to lead this new cancer initiative biden ha met with all the major cancer group some two dozen and individual that kaufman describes a a 'who 's who in cancer a formal 'presidential memorandum with kennedy era moon shot language will establish a task force of federal agency and department from the nih to the pentagon and once that is complete biden will convene a meeting at the white house to establish an agenda for the year ahead 'and the measurables say press secretary meghan dubyak at a roundtable at the university of pennsylvania cancer center biden said he doe n't want anyone to think he 's 'na ve in setting such a sweeping goal a curing cancer he know it ca n't be done overnight but he insists that tremendous leap can be made by marshaling the resource of the federal government and leveraging what 's already happening in the private sector i for one would n't bet against him cancer research ha never had a cheerleader a high profile and a committed a biden it wa n't that long ago that hiv aid wa a death sentence can the same great leap forward occur for cancer a lot of smart people are saying it could for something like this the politics are irrelevant everyone wish biden well there are no hidden agenda 'what he 's doing is primarily to honor his son but also to do something truly important to make sure the next beau doe n't have to die prematurely say jonah blank who worked for biden on his senate staff and is now with the rand corporation 'will it happen in the next year probably not the next five or maybe a a longshot but biden might well have another year of civic contribution and would n't that be a great legacy a a society we pay more attention to former president than former vice president but that wo n't deter biden 'i plan on doing this the rest of my life he enthused when

three year last week because of dispute about same sex marriage that rift is just the surface of a much deeper division reflecting the polarization of christian life in the st century the anglican communion which began a the church of england under henry viii is now a global network spanning country there are about million anglican in the world including about million episcopalian mostly in the u s a of this week however those episcopalian are second class anglican member can not vote in any anglican communion decision on church doctrine and can not represent the communion in any interfaith body essentially for three year episcopalian are anglican without any standing in their own church the suspension took place at a meeting of 'primates the archbishop and other leader representing the constituent church of the anglican communion the reason for suspension came last june when the episcopal church removed doctrinal language defining marriage a between a man and a woman and authorized marriage rite for same sex couple while it 's still up to individual church whether to solemnize same sex union but the vote formally allowed them to do so according to the primate these action were improper because the episcopal church acted on it own 'such unilateral action the primate said in their official statement are 'a departure from the mutual accountability and interdependence implied through being in relationship with each other in the anglican communion according to some episcopal leader that is bunk national church body routinely make doctrinal decision on their own some anglican church still do not ordain woman for example what this is really about is homosexuality'and what that is really about is what kind of church the anglican communion is today the answer for decade now is a divided one until the th century the anglican church was'as the name implies'basically british and headed officially by the british monarch with the spread of the british empire however came the spread of anglicanism to all corner of the world by the end of the century the contemporary anglican communion came into being including not only the church of england scotland and ireland but also the episcopal church and church in 'provinces across the world two major development created the schism facing the church today the liberalization of the episcopal church and the growth in power and number of african asian and south american one george washington wa an episcopalian so were madison monroe fdr and seven other presidents'eleven in total and in the th and th century the episcopal church wa perhaps the leading christian denomination in america during this time episcopalianism embodied american propriety and upper class values'conservative but reasonable j

civil right era african american parish had been around since the s but often separate but un equal in the episcopal church 's general convention passed a resolution affirming 'the natural dignity and value of every man of whatever color or race a created in the image of god over the objection of southern leader the church began to take side in the civil right struggle of the time the change wa gradual and uneven but by the end of s liberal had the upper hand and conservative had mostly left often to join the newly minted christian right made up largely of evangelicals baptist and catholic woman were ordained a priest in and a bishop in prim church service started to loosen up by the s the episcopal church had changed from the starchy denomination of rockefeller republican to a smaller denomination of mostly liberal at the same time the rest of the anglican communion wa changing radically with adherent in the global south coming to outnumber those in europe and north america the church in british commonwealth country emerged in different social context with different value and different often hostile relationship to liberalism moreover they found themselves competing with evangelical inroad conservative until two year ago catholicism and islam with the most pious seeming religious tradition often 'winning for all these reason and more the emergent anglicanism of the global south wa a far more conservative anglicanism even than the old episcopalianism let alone the new one the watershed moment came at an important anglican conference in when theological conservative from africa asia and latin america defeated the liberal on a key vote homosexuality arguably the split we saw this week is just a later stage of the process begun year ago homosexuality is the catalyst but not the only contentious issue to liberal the episcopal church is moving into the st century setting aside biblical fundamentalism and responding to how people actually live their life but to anglican conservative the episcopal church ha lost it way moving toward a mushy universalism that downplays christian exclusivity in favor of pluralism and take liberal position on abortion lgbt equality and other hot button issue perhaps the great open question in american religion is whether liberal denomination like episcopalianism have a future or not a jack jenkins at thinkprogress noted presbyterianism'donald trump 's denomination'is even more liberal than the episcopal church and presbyterian leader have frequently criticized trump 's position on immigration and islam american christianity in general is in a period of steep decline and mainline protestant denominations'plus white non hispanic catholics'are declining the most we are moving toward a religiously polarized america thirty percent of american between the age of profess 'none a their religious affiliation while at the other extreme around percent of american subscribe to a resurgent ultra

have a lot to offer seeing a it provides those thing without preposterous belief divisive social more or fire breathing sermon and it doe to many but even though percent of american say they believe in god they seem uninterested in expressing that belief in moderate reasonable church the american religious landscape then resembles the anglican communion a a whole on one end a shrinking number of

nominee clinton declared on thursday night 's installment of the tonight show starring jimmy fallon 'it 'll be quite the showdown yeah the real estate mogul in fact had been fallon 's guest on monday 's program so the late night comic favored the former first lady new york senator and secretary of state with his patented trump impression along the republican frontrunner 's saber rattling remark that 'i have n't even started on hillary yet 'does he intimidate you fallon asked clinton'whose celebrity status is at least the equal of the donald's'waited a beat flashed her eye dismissively and answered with a barely audible 'no that produced the looked for laugh from the studio audience 'tell you what'he 's a lot more obsessed with me than i am with him clinton added'a comment no doubt designed to provoke a twitter tirade from the thatch roofed tough talking tyro politician earlier fallon had joked during the monologue 'there are four star in the universe named after donald trump a burning ball of hot air ha star named after him a with her last appearance with fallon in september'also by no coincidence on the night of a republican presidential debate a bit of calculated counterprogramming'clinton 's mission wa to present herself a likable enough especially now that the iowa caucus and new hampshire primary are mere day away she laughed and laughed at fallon 's impression of her husband bill shared her technique for staying awake when she ha n't been given time to sleep 'i dig my fingernail into my palm confided her granddaughter charlotte 's fixation on the sesame street character elmo and did a pretty fair impression of the elmo doll that she gave charlotte for christmas and even sat for a few selfies with fallon which the talk show host immediately posted on the candidate 's snapchat account one with animated cartoon character spring sprouting out of his eyeball at one point fallon wa so close to clinton during a selfie pose that he practically sat in her lap 'if you recognize the cologne it 's the axe effect he lewdly advised'prompting a fusillade of clintonian giggle clinton continues to suffer from a trust deficit with voter who read daily about her email trouble and the fbi investigation of same and are put off by her ideological flexibility and air of perpetual premeditation fallon could n't resist a gentle jape about clinton 's trouble in the monologue 'backstage she told me she 's a huge fan of the show and i told her 'yeah i know i read it in your email ' recent poll show that year old vermont senator sander an avowed socialist with a brooklyn accent and crazy white hair is within striking distance in iowa and beating her soundly in new hampshire'an unimaginable circumstance and potential catastrophe if realized that seems to be scaring the bejeezus out of clinton 's combat hardened campaign operative in a display of either admirable grit or virtuosic insincerity maybe a bit of both clinton affected not to be rattled when fallon'who wa polite enough to introduce her a the 'leading candidate and 'democratic frontrunner 'asked about her rapidly shrinking advantage in the race for the white house 'we 're in a tight race clinton said adding that she never really credited those early poll '' that 's really artificial 'that had her running with seemingly insurmountable double digit lead over sander and former maryland governor martin o'malley 'i 'm excited she added brightly grinning an electric grin 'this is not a job they give away you really have to work hard for it o'malley poor man is so far behind that he 's barely a speck in the rear view mirror fallon mistakenly suggested that it would only be clinton and sander facing off in sunday 's democratic debate in charleston south carolina to be carried on nbc and clinton wa compelled to correct him 'governor o'malley 's there too she said'a comment that inspired cruel laughter among a group of political reporter who were screening a live feed of the taping a few floor above the tonight show studio in rockefeller center just like trump on monday clinton ended her appearance by submitting to a mock job interview with fallon firing question that he read off of a clipboard how did she hear about the position 'fourth grade social study why is she suited for the job 'i think i have the experience the qualification to tackle the range of challenge this job presents'and i have reference why doe she want it 'i really care what happens to our country and so on and so forth what are her strength 'i 'm tenacious i 'm determined i 've gotten result at which point fallon demanded 'can you type amid the audience laughter clinton said 'i can in a pinch and then embarked on a lengthy disquisition about typing on a keyboard versus an iphone and her frustration with the annoying autocorrect feature that override eccentric spelling and produce word that have zero to do with anything 'we 're interviewing you fallon interrupted 'you 're chatty he added to more laughter 'you 're chatty cathy describe yourself in two word he instructed 'strong focused she answered after some thought 'and lastly fallon declared 'is there an

email wa only part of the 'first tranche of the review a state department employee noted at the time leaving open the possibility that more classified information would be found which it wa patrick f

kendall resisted saying he needed a full record of his own of the page of email clinton had sent in order to respond to information request from a house committee investigating the attack on u s

tried further to persuade kendall to delete the classified email the message had been forwarded to clinton by one of her senior aide jacob sullivan in november and contained reference to the attack in benghazi two month earlier rather within a few day state department employee were told to develop a system that would let kendall keep the email in a state department provided safe at his law firm in washington d c where he and a partner had access to them 'the arrangement with kendall wa far from the norm steven aftergood an expert on classification and security policy at the federation of american scientist told the daily beast 'there are a number of attorney around who handle client and case involving classified information they are almost never allowed to retain classified material in their office whether they have a safe or not sometimes they are not even allowed to review the classified information even if they are cleared for it because an agency will say they do n't have a 'need to know ' in any event the deference shown to mr kendall by the state department wa quite unusual a early a may kendall had been made aware that at least one email in clinton 's archive included classified information but that did n't become public knowledge for some time and when the clinton campaign became aware of it is unclear a late a july clinton campaign spokeswoman karen finney wa

benghazi fallon told the daily beast the arrangement with kendall ha been previously reported but the document reveal new detail about what wa happening inside the state department a official moved ahead with the unorthodox setup at one point a state department lawyer questioned whether kendall or one of his associate katherine turner wa qualified to receive and maintain classified information 'do any of the lawyer have t top secret clearance sarah prosser a legal adviser at state asked colleague in an email in august after more classified material had been found in clinton 's email it 's not clear from the email portion of which are heavily redacted what the answer wa but kendall later said he and turner did have a top secret level clearance given to him previously by the state department a part of his work representing clinton before the benghazi committee there 's no indication of what legal review state undertook to verify that or determine whether the arrangement wa acceptable top secret clearance do n't necessarily entitle someone to all classified information sen chuck grassley r ia later questioned whether there may have been information in the email for which kendall and turner did n't have the appropriate clearance including so called compartmented information that is derived from some of the most highly classified intelligence collecting system in the u

designation than top secret kendall ha long argued particularly in correspondence with lawmaker that the email in his possession were not originally classified and were only deemed so after they were reviewed by government auditor one internal email show that the state department shared that assessment 'in the first tranche of email there wa one that wa subsequently classified an executive assistant at state told gregory starr the assistant secretary for diplomatic security in an email recounting the exchange between kennedy and kendall starr wa asked to appoint someone from state 's

kept who ha access to the area safe do those individual have appropriate clearance ' it 's not clear from the document what review took place the question of whether kendall should be allowed to keep classified email received new scrutiny in july after investigator found additional clinton email that they thought contained classified information at the time grassley said that at least two email

precise'with downton 's writer creator julian fellowes at his best drama and comedy the cheesy and the heartfelt all melded perfectly and gosh quickly yes downton the gorgeous english country house with it warrenously plotted world of master mistress and servant is in peril again when ha it ever been not in a mirror of modern time the talk wa of cutting back of falling revenue and a necessity of tightening belt and a sense that the role and nature of being waited upon wa becoming defunct this being downton the seriousness of that and the historical reference to the wage bill and the like wa undercut by the deftly written humor of the countess dowager 's lady maid denker played by sue johnston stirring the pot among the servant about who might get the chop fellowes run a strict moral universe so her attempt to frighten both the main house under stair staff and her nemesis the countess dowager 's butler spratt jeremy swift'brilliantly snarky smarmy and bumbling backfired with violet crawley the countess dowager maggie smith on a per great withering form intimating falsely that denker herself might get the bullet violet said she did so because she liked to rule by fear and this wa apparent in another subplot in which she isobel crawley penelope wilton and the previously storyline free listless cora elizabeth mcgovern become involved in a battle royale for control of the local hospital'basically should it run itself or be run by a larger health authority 'does it ever get cold on the moral high ground the countess dowager asked isobel that magnificent lip curl dialed to the max a this rumbled on and lord grantham hugh bonneville wondered how to keep the estate going his daughter mary michelle dockery and edith laura carmichael threw light shade in each other 's direction a their own life progressed mary started by almost being blackmailed by a former chambermaid who know she had illicit nooky with lord gillingham in liverpool this proto villain rita bevan brought with her'as the bolshier working class character in downton abbey sometimes do'an element of class warfare which fellowes is very rum about eventually and completely implausibly bevan wa despatched with fifty pound and a flea in her ear by lord grantham it 's the kind of downton plot which rumble baroquely into life then'does fellowes just get bored writing one wonder 'fizzles to nothing the conclusion for lord grantham watching mary 's indecisive handling of this situation was'equally bafflingly'that she would make an excellent steward of downton so mary will now help run the house 's affair you sense at moment like this fellowes looking at his computer screen and going 'fuck it if they say it quick enough and with a smile and we put some orchestral music in no one will question it quite right we 're busted however moment in this hokum y plot also showed those crystallizing moment of downton at it best and sweetest'such a mary quietly wondering aloud to carson jim carter what could she do that he would ever condemn her for there is something eternally heart tugging about these moment between her the lady and him the servant and second father who ha watched her grow up'utterly manipulative to script and watch utterly winning every time carter 's ability to switch between the gruff master of downstairs snapping at the servant to do their work and then bumbling in matter more personal wa itself beautifully caught in the mini tale of how he and mr hughes phyllis logan and mr h 's first name is elsie we found out may be 'full husband and wife the two most polite and restrained servant are getting together but she did n't know if he expected her to have sex how would they be intimate with each other she worried to mr patmore lesley nicol all of this wa played out in period language and with all the discomfort of not just all three personality but the more of the time it led to mr hughes enlisting mr patmore to ask mr carson what he expected and'after speaking at cross purposes'a wonderful scene where mr carter not only expressed he hoped they would have a 'full marriage but also the depth of his love for mr hughes this both moving and funny dance around sexual politesse wa played to perfection by all three actor if you had n't cried at mr carson 's cutely growled 'i love her i am tickled by her i am bursting with pride that she would be my wife declaration of love for mr hughes to mr patmore the travail of mr and mr bates brendan coyle and joanne froggatt would have had you reaching for both a headache tablet and another box of tissue after what seems like two lifetime of them swapping the courtroom dock and jail cell with each other over murder neither committed but both were accused of it wa left to mr bates to be finally exonerated for pushing her rapist mr green under a bus in another lightning piece of plotting which made little sense though downton fan know to shrug at the show 's strange stitching it turned out another woman did it just came forward and apologized and yep that wa that for something that felt like it had been going on since the late edwardian era it wa over in five second but this is mr and mr bates the most miserable troubled couple in the world on a sunny day they 'd travel thousand of mile to find a cloud to sit under and so even before the policeman had delivered the nominally good news that for once neither of them wa under suspicion of murder unhappiness wa theirs again mr bates thought she wa pregnant but she wa n't and this wa n't the first time she thought she wa pregnant but wa n't and'she wept'mr bates no matter how much he tell her that he love her and it doe n't matter it really doe because she ca n't give him what he want a baby give u all strength basically fellow fan there may not be another murder charge yet but fellowes ha found another agonizing long term poison for mr and mr bates ' tortured relationship indeed the only people happy about mr bates ' freedom was'well'every other character indeed the occasion demanded one of those rare moment when 'upstairs ' visited 'downstairs ' to celebrate a gramophone wa even produced so the prole could enjoy some dancing for goodness sake'and a lord grantham availed himself from some snack from mr patmore 's fridge one of carson 's raised bushy eyebrow reminded him whose territory he wa invading and to be respectful of that of fellowes ' two longest standing outlet for narrative punishment there wa a mixed evening kitchen hand daisy sophie mcshera standing up for her dead loved one 's dad 's right to tenant his farm yes deep breath required again led her to confront the new owner of his farm for some reason her verbal attack wa considered potential ground for sacking daisy and no one'publicly or privately'stood up for her or even congratulated her bravery ha anyone else got a crush on mr mason paul copley the goodly tenant farmer in question just me ok fellowes 's other consistent outlet for sadism had a worrying perk in her step lady edith ha become a medium magnate and is mulling a move to london there she could swan among the bloomsbury set and no one would question who marigold her secret daughter being passed off a an orphan was'because erm fellowes type quickly london is so big this wa hilarious not least because lady edith is very rich and moving in high society and people would absolutely ask who the young child she wa parenting wa so both lady mary and lady edith are now single and powerful'and one sens that formerly evil footman barrow robert james collier may also be either looking to spread his wing or bed the new hot servant who everyone rather meanly keep trying to warn him away from stolen smile between them may suggest a frisson'which also seems to thrum between molesley kevin doyle and baxter raquel cassidy who helped get mr bates off the murder charge through some sleuthing and whose good character were eloquently summarized in thanks by mr bates this deliciously fast pithy nutty emotional episode ended with mr hughes and mr carson in an embrace following another potential misunderstanding there 's going to be a few of these borne by their pent up nature you sense she saying he could have her 'warts and all wa quoting oliver cromwell'and that phrase also pretty sum up the necessary acceptance fan take on watching downton we accept it for all it flaw plot leap plot hole and character inconsistency because it also ha it own beauty and solid emotional heart we 'll be with it to the end however maddening

2,9544392.0,2016-01-01T05:01:00+00:00,bill cosby tamir rice and the power of prosecutor,what do bill cosby and tamir rice 's have in common their case reveal the immense power of prosecutor consider the fact that in andrea constand told police that bill cosby gave her drug and sexually assaulted her why wa n't he charged the prosecutor did n't think there wa enough evidence ten year later cosby is charged why partly because of new bit of evidence'cosby 's admission that he sometimes gave woman drug in order to have sex with them and at least other accusation against him but mostly because now there 's a different prosecutor kevin steele these are judgment call in and now consider the case of tamir rice michael brown and eric garner none of the police officer responsible for their death were ever charged'not convicted'charged in all three case prosecutor practically told grand jury not to indict in ferguson robert mcculloch decided to simply present all the evidence to the grand jury rather than make a case against officer darren wilson in staten island darren donovan a republican with extensive tie to the police department failed to secure an indictment against daniel pantaleo whose chokehold led to eric garner 's death and most recently in cleveland tim mcginty stated openly that he did n't believe anyone should be charged in the shooting of year old tamir rice set aside for the moment the fact of these case what 's striking in all of them is that county prosecutor and district attorney singlehandedly and without oversight decide the fate of the accused more judgment call unreviewed and unreviewable true there is some oversight most of these prosecutor are elected if voter do n't like how they 're doing or not doing their job they can vote them out of office indeed in the case of bill cosby then d a bruce castor 's decision not to indict in became an issue in his election battle with kevin steele this year but is this really 'oversight a the daily beast reported last september voter often know next to nothing about the candidate running for position a prosecutor or judge turnout is extremely low especially in off year and when voter are paying attention they are bamboozled by the only campaign message that seems to work 'tough on crime this year for example steele ran on his ' percent conviction rate and 'tough sentence for sexual predator that 's what people want right they see prosecutor a agent of the criminal justice system and everyone want le crime this lead to two perverse incentive for prosecutor first they have an incentive to over charge criminal defendant and secure conviction more than justice second they have an incentive not to charge police officer who after all are fighting crime every day and with whom they work closely on a daily basis in principle if officer pantaleo wilson and loehmann violated the law then they are criminal but in practice they are policeman and perceived a the opposite of criminal voter who want to get tough on crime do not want to get tough on cop so not only is there no meaningful oversight of prosecutor but the oversight that doe exist is skewed to specific outcome and behavior not impartiality and performance now back to cosby if you pay close attention to what steele said this week you 'll notice that he went out of his way to mention the new evidence that ha come to light in the last twelve month 'a prosecutor 's job is to follow the evidence wherever it lead and whenever it come to light he said announcing the arrest in part this wa to explain the nearly twelve year gap between the crime and the charge but in large part it wa to explain why cosby is being charged in but wa n't in and what is that new evidence only what is known a 'habit evidence that cosby admitted to drugging and having sex with other woman but not constand'however ludicrous it may seem cosby 's position is that she consented is habit evidence really enough to reopen a closed case and file charge again that 's another judgment call like judge robreno 's decision to unseal the damning deposition record steele 's decision wa basically up to him of course steele chose to make it an election issue a well he 'd look foolish if having just accused bruce castor of doing nothing he did nothing too but again that wa steele 's decision just a prosecuting 'america 's dad in might have made castor loo bad prosecuting america 's rapist in make steele look good we imagine that district attorney and other prosecutor are motivated by truth justice and the american way but in fact they are elected official who paint in broad stroke for a mostly ignorant public who unlike judge can not be held accountable for their misconduct by oversight board and who exercise discretion so broad that the disposition of justice often lie entirely within their judgment finally of course tamir rice and bill cosby have more in common than under zealous prosecutor both african american male one quite young and one quite old operating in a system in which percent of prosecutor are white and local police force are percent white for decade cosby wa protected by his wealth celebrity class and connection particularly at temple university but he is the exception not the rule black men comprise percent of the u s population but percent of the prison population they receive sentence roughly percent more severe than white defendant convicted of identical crime and when they are perceived to be older than they are bigger than they are more dangerous than they are or more violent than they are their percent white police officer and percent white prosecutor exercise 'discretion in remarkably similar way the united state is the only country in the world that elect prosecutor based on sloganeering and then hold them to no standard other than majority whim after nearly year bill cosby ha indeed been charged with a crime but only because a prosecutor decided to do so'this

case a state issued medical marijuana id is required while still not in store a large part of foria 's campaign revolves around the history of marijuana and female health in gerson 's eye the

'favorably upon the uterine musculature and suggested it be used to counteract 'painful menstrual cramp overall they concluded that it had 'particular influence over visceral pain in the same paper

some state saying pregnant woman caught using it could be charged with child abuse given the lack of research it 's no surprise that foria 's make no mention of pregnant woman in it marketing for now

a problem he created according to the un more than people have died since the war broke in the spring of not even several round of sanction against moscow and summit convened to end the violence ha convinced putin withdraw his troop out of ukraine like marlo putin doe not believe in pulling out of territory he belief is his until ukraine get enough muscle to fight putin they 'll have to accept his package for now that package is russian troop in east ukraine and the annexation of crimea marlo 's 'vacants ' operate like putin 's prison system 'marlo can make an inconvenient nigga disappear ca n't he ' proposition joe in season four of the series marlo wa winning a violent street war against the barksdale organization and other smaller drug outfit when marlo wanted someone executed he would dispatch chris and snoop to kill the person in an abandoned home nail the entrance shut with power gun and leave their body on the street these marlo made tomb were known a 'vacants anyone who dared to cross the young drug lord found himself in one proposition joe an east side drug lord who organized 'the co op where the city 's top dope boy handled street dispute under an united nation like framework during one of their meeting he joked that 'marlo can make an inconvenient nigga disappear ca n't he in russia the prison system serf a putin 's vacants almost anyone who openly opposes his power end up arrested on a trumped up charge and slapped with a lengthy prison term the most famous person to find himself in putin 's vacants wa mikhail khodorkovsky the owner of yukos the largest oil company in russia in the early s khodorkovsky 's wealth wa estimated to be billion at one point according to forbes after putin won the presidency in he met with the country 's key oligarch in february of that year and told them he would not interfere with their business a long a they stayed out of politics khodorkovsky did not heed putin 's warning and began supporting his opposition he wa eventually arrested on fraud tax evasion and other financial crime then he wa held in prison for two year before he wa tried and sentenced to nine year behind bar in khodorkovsky wa released in and is now living outside of russia but the former billionaire is n't the only person to have found himself in putin 's vacants under a law designed to suppress political dissent anyone who is arrested for disrupting a public space more than twice within a day period is subject to arrest and a stiff prison term of up to five year anti government protester have been sentenced to lengthy prison for term of one year and more in recent month human right group have called sentence harsh and a freak violation of civil liberty but in order to do anything on putin 's street you have to seek his permission first protesting the government is n't one of them like marlo putin can make an inconvenient political foe disappear in vacants of his own what make him worse than marlo is that he doe n't have to resort to using boarded up house in desolate part of town the russian prison system is putin 's vacants and russian who dare to publicly oppose his power know they 'll end up in one putin addressed the un general assembly in marlo like fashion 'my name is my name 'marlo stanfield when putin spoke before the un general assembly in october after a ten year absence he came to new york to tell world leader who russia wa and how he expected others to engage moscow and if they did n't like it tough the sanction brussels and washington orchestrated against russia over it invasion of ukraine had begun to hit it economy hard at this point so he probably felt the need to speak forcefully a to show the russian people he would not be punked by the west similarly marlo had to lay down the law towards the end of season five he and his three top lieutenant were arrested and detained for conspiracy to distribute narcotic in their holding cell one of them told marlo that omar little the most notorious robber of drug dealer in baltimore had been calling him out by name on the street marlo took it that a a threat to his street cred and ordered his men to let the hood know he is n't a punk and will take out anyone who second guess his gangster 'my name wa on the street when we bounce from this shit here you gon ' go down on those corner and let them people know word did not get back to me let 'em marlo step to any muthafuckin ' body omar barksdale whatever 'my name is my name that pretty much sum up putin 's speech last year calling out world leader for manipulating the global diplomatic process to benefit a few 'privileged nation he said 'however the bloc thinking of the time of the cold war and the desire to explore new geopolitical area is still present among some of our colleague first they continue their policy of expanding nato what for if the warsaw bloc stopped it existence the soviet union have collapsed ph and nevertheless the nato continues expanding a well a it military infrastructure then they offered the poor soviet country a false choice either to be with the west or with the east sooner or later this logic of confrontation wa bound to spark off a grave geopolitical crisis this is exactly what happened in ukraine where the discontent of population with the current authority wa used and the military coup wa orchestrated from outside'that triggered a civil war a a result translation if the west can expand it empire so can we russia ha a right to do what the hell we want to do in our country and area that we consider to be within our 'sphere of influence namely ukraine if we want to invade a country annex a huge chunk of it and regulate it political outcome we will during his speech he did n't express regret over the life lost during the war in ukraine or admit to any wrongdoing for his troop being there he denies russian troop are conducting offensive military operation he even took shot at the united state and europe for it nato operation in libya by essentially saying it left a power vacuum for terrorist to fill 'i can not help asking those who have caused the situation do you realize now what you 've done but i am afraid no one is going to answer that he said 'indeed policy based on self conceit and belief in one 's exceptionality and impunity have never been abandoned putin 's message wa clear i may be a gangster but so are you he wa letting the world know that 'my name is my name putin ha never portrayed himself to be something he is n't like marlo his thirst for power leaf him very little wiggle to negotiate with dissenting voice in russia doing so would mark him a 'weak and his adversary will try him that 's why he creates law that lock up anti government protester for up to five year kremlin politics are a blood sport the way putin approach politics is very much how marlo view the drug game there wa a scene in the show where marlo shoplifted a pack of candy in plain view of the guard on duty when the guard confronted him to explain how disrespected he felt marlo 's response wa 'you want it one way but it 's the other way like many people who disrespected marlo the guard ended up dead though no one can link putin to their death his most prominent opponent all end up dead boris nemtsov wa shot and killed near the kremlin in february two day before he wa to lead an opposition rally anna politkovskaya an activist journalist who earned international acclaim over her coverage accusing the russian government of human right abuse in chechnya wa shot dead outside of her apartment in alexander litvinenko a former secret service agent died in november of after being poisoned with a deadly dose of radioactive polonium it is alleged that russian security serviceman carried out the poisoning to silence litvinenko after he blamed the government for orchestrating the apartment bombing in russia so it could then blame it on chechen rebel to justify it invasion later that year like putin marlo wa accused of murder but the cop could n't find enough evidence to link him to any body in their own way both men operate like teflon don that is pretty much where the marlo putin comparison come full circle in international politics no one 's hand are clean putin at the end of the day is a world leader who is looking out for russia 's interest and his own and a much a i abhor drug dealing marlo is just a peg in the wheelhouse of a fucked up city in which all of it institution are failing the people the drug game is horrible but international affair is just a vicious and corrupted by the same kind of greedy flawed player who look down on the marlo 's of the world putin 's behavior in ukraine and treatment of his own people may very well fit the description of thuggery but let 's not pretend america 's own expansionism and human right abuse the second iraq war numerous documented cia assassination attempt of world leader over policing and mass incarceration of marginalized group for starter doe n't measure up to what the russian leader is doing in his own country also keep in mind a black person like me can walk outside of my home here in new york city and be choked to death like eric garner or slammed to the ground during a routine traffic stop and die in jail three day later like sandra bland yes the drug game marlo played in wa vicious and cruel but so is american imperialism and white supremacy putin said a much during an interview with charlie rose in october 'do you believe that everything is perfect now from the point of view of democracy now in the united state if everything wa perfect there would n't be the problem of ferguson there would be no abuse by the police though russia ha race issue of it own putin ha a point america is the pot calling the kettle black from a foreign policy standpoint we have to stop positioning america a the more noble side during our engagement with moscow because both country are imperialist nation with expansionist agenda neither is better than the other they both do fucked up shit to weaker state america did invade iraq in and nato felt it wa it business to take out muammar gaddafi in libya in and let 's not even get into the united state ' long long history of interfering'to often terrible effect'in latin america and the caribbean by viewing u s russian policy through the lens of the wire i believe we can analyze more effectively how to best engage moscow but to be clear putin is like marlo they 're both gangster but given how dirty both of their world are i just do n't think it 's fair to single them out a the worst one the wire understood this and positioned it depiction of the 'good guy and 'bad guy accordingly too bad the men in three piece suit in washington and brussels condemning putin over his behavior ca n't look at their own action with similar honesty and self reflection,11042.0

genesis and there 's a rogue mormon leader who unleashes an army of homophobic missionary to stop the two 'apostates but stripling warrior is not just a playful and unabashedly gay superhero story it 's a parable about a church that is deeply divided over the question of same sex marriage last november in response to the legalization of same sex marriage the mormon church instituted a controversial policy change prohibiting any child who primarily resides with same sex parent from being baptized until they 're 'eight is the typical age of baptism'and only then if the child 'specifically disavows the practice of same gender cohabitation and marriage it also defined member who 'are in a same gender marriage 'members like andersen and his husband'as 'apostates threatening

acceptance of homosexuality wa actually rising within the faith according to pew data percent of mormon now believe that homosexuality should be socially accepted'up percent from in stripling warrior andersen represents this division within mormonism in the form a missionary character who rescue the two hero from his homophobic peer 'not all of u believe that homosexual are evil he tell shepard and fernandez after incapacitating the attacking missionary 'i love my church i believe in the gospel i sustain my first presidency but i do n't agree that a gay person is le than i am andersen said that the character wa modeled after his own experience with mormon ally 'i have a lot of very good straight mormon friend who are deeply conflicted by the church 's action toward gay i wanted to give them a voice a well but the most important story andersen tell in stripling warrior is his own a a young man he served a two year mormon mission in guatemala before trying his hand at dating woman again making excuses'like garlic breath or mono'for his reluctance to kiss them 'all the while i wa agonizing over my lack of heterosexuality he told the daily beast 'those wannabe straight

a it turn out the angel wa there to give him some awesome superpower and a sword for smiting sinner 'that come directly from my own perspective a a newly out homosexual mormon andersen told the daily beast 'i thought i would be punished for turning my back on a church i had loved with every fiber of my being now in his forty andersen and his husband a lifelong mormon have a two year old daughter who wa born via surrogate the new mormon policy will forbid her from being baptized unless she disavows her dad a an adult 'i 've since realized that homosexuality is a wonderful gift andersen told

tuesday evening not for a taping of celebrity apprentice or a casting for dancing with the star but to endorse him for president of the united state dressed in a black overcoat and blue tie the gop frontrunner walked out onstage at iowa state university and gripped the lectern stamped with his name 'wow look at the press out there they must think that a big event 's gon na happen today he said 'wow that 's a lot'it 's like the academy award he freestyled for minute about his poll number and how big league he win before welcoming a bedazzled palin with a hug and a kiss on the cheek he called her 'a spectacular person and said her endorsement wa 'very special to me trump stood off to her left and looked on a she spoke his arm dangling awkwardly at his side he smirked 'heads are spinning palin began 'this is gon na be so much fun searching for meaning in this spectacle is like trying to find enlightenment in the ball pit at chuck e cheese and the joke well they write themselves but they 're not very funny which in a sense is the key to trump 's success in the republican primary and perhaps life in general trump persists because he defies parody he like palin is in on the joke that is his public persona the difference is he 's better at telling it than any lowly scribe or comedian and he tell it not with a device a obvious a self deprecation but with subtlety in his every decision minor or yuge in his official capacity a the frontrunner for the republican presidential nomination which is where palin come in 'no more pussyfooting around she shouted 'he 's going rogue left and right man that 's why he 's doing so well once governor of alaska palin 's own road to caricature began when she joined trump foe john mccain 's presidential campaign a his running mate her tinny voiced performance a a vice presidential candidate wa at turn erratic and self destructive by election day it wa difficult to distinguish between the real palin and the version of her performed by tina fey on saturday night live for a time after mccain 's defeat palin enjoyed her status a an in demand conservative star too rogue to be tamed by the establishment elite but her shtick complete with prop like big gulp and dr seuss book seemed to grow tired tlc canceled her reality show sarah palin 's alaska after just one season palin sighting on cable news occurred with le and le frequency a cbs news poll from january found that percent of republican did n't want her to run for president in this election to borrow a phrase from the donald palin is a loser'but a potentially useful one like conspiracy monger alex jones who wa welcomed into trump 's orbit in december trump associate with sideshow and freak a if to run on hot coal before the american public and medium who are left covered in sludge and scratching their head but unlike almost every politician before him he can not be tainted by these association no failed governor or tinfoil hat wearing radio host or white supremacist making robocalls on his behalf can reflect poorly on his character perhaps because we suspect he ha none but trump befriended palin before his formal foray into republican politics began in they were photographed eating pizza together in new york city'with fork in august palin interviewed trump by webcam for the right wing one america news network he told her he liked her and her family 'so much there is overlap among their lackey too trump political director michael glassner previously served a chief of staff to palin 's political action committee and trump 's spokeswoman katrina pierson wa endorsed by palin in when she ran for congress in texas roger stone a longtime trump confidant who worked on the campaign until august said trump only stand to gain from palin 's public embrace 'she is popular with evangelicals who dominate the process he told me 'also blot out sun for ted cruz at the very least trump loses nothing after tuesday 's big show at most he starves cruz'his central rival'of much needed medium coverage with two week to spare until the iowa caucus unlike other threat like ben carson cruz ha proved impervious to trump 's put down despite week of trump questioning cruz 's citizenship cruz ha hardly moved an inch in the iowa poll where he wa beating trump a recently a two week ago a of this writing trump stand just a percentage point above cruz in the real clear politics polling average in the state aiding trump 's cause is iowa gov terry branstad who sparring with cruz over ethanol said tuesday that he hope the texas senator is defeated a surreal a tuesday 's performance felt at time it wa guided by a certain logic even palin who flailed her sequined arm in the air for the crowd equal part pep and menace in her voice sounded a nuanced battle cry 'you ready for a commander and chief who will do their job and go kick isi as she screamed at one point but then she explained her plight and the plight of all trump true believer 'trump 's candidacy '' it ha exposed not just that tragic the ramification of betrayal of the country but '' two he ha exposed the complicity on both side of the country that ha enabled it she said 'he 's been able to tear the veil off this idea of the system how the system really work in trump palin see a leader '' one who wo n't be pushed off to the corner like she wa 'we need someone new who ha the power and is in the position to bust up that establishment she said she complained that the establishment republican are a much to blame a the democrat and in their effort to thwart trump they have maligned all of conservative america 'funny haha '' not funny she said seemingly out of nowhere 'but now what they 're doing is whaling on trump and his trumpeter 'well they 're not conservative enough '' 'oh my goodness gracious what the heck would the establishment know about conservatism she said she and those like her '' those who like trump '' are 'right winging bitter clinging proud clinging to our gun and our constitution 'doggone right we 're angry she said 'justifiably so she said trump could be trusted because 'he build thing he build big thing thing that touch the sky big infrastructure

is said to have expressed disbelief that nixon had won the presidency because she did n't know anyone who 'd voted for him it probably never happened but it stick around particularly in the mind of conservative pundit because it 's a clear illustration of what the right think of a elite disconnect from the life of everyday american worldly affluent well educated urbanites like kael live in a tiny isolated social bubble making them much le knowledgeable about american life and culture than they think they are that bubble may have something to do with why so few reporter and pundit saw donald trump sticking around thing inside the bubble where plenty of journalist reside are comfortable much of the rest of the rest of the country meanwhile seems to think america is dying and so here we find ourselves just a couple week from iowa with trump still the runaway frontrunner far from watching his support dissolve a the first primary contest near it 's actually solidifying the only other candidate making wave is ted cruz another guy a lot of u sort of wrote off some month ago a too divisive and off putting to win and he had a very good night thursday i still hear people say that marco rubio is destined to have a big bounce or that jeb with his resource can somehow mount a comeback and i guess they could the only problem with these theory is that right now there 's approximately zero evidence to back them up we 've entered it seems to me a two man race for the gop nomination there is trump there is cruz and then there 's a bunch of guy who just wo n't win let 's talk about those other guy the four republican establishment hopeful jeb marco john kasich and chris christie actually it 's probably a little misleading to even pretend that there are four republican establishment hopeful kasich ha barely made an impression and is despised by much of the conservative activist class who see him a a smug crypto liberal jeb ha spent many many million and it 's done nothing but make him more and more unpopular and the fact that we 're even talking about the scandal plagued squishy and deeply unpopular governor of new jersey just highlight how profoundly weak this field turned out to be when faced with trump this is all to say that if you 're a republican who doe n't like trump or cruz you have one real option left and that 's rubio rubio is at least in a traditional sense the best politician in the whole bunch he 's the most articulate which he showed again at the debate on thursday another in a series of strong performance he know policy and how to talk about it he 's young and attractive but the best candidate on paper is n't working out in real life at least not in any meaningful sense he ha n't been able to capitalize on bush 's utter and ongoing collapse and of course his back and forth on immigration over the year have done him considerable damage the only plausible path to victory for him i 've seen via the conservative twitter pundit dan mclaughlin presupposes both a trump collapse and rubio losing the first three contest before racking up enough delegate in blue state to narrowly overcome cruz maybe rubio get that last minute surge but i really doubt it plenty ha been written on why trump ha owned the poll for such a long time the best explanation to my mind wa from david frum in the atlantic so without delving into the psychology of the trump supporter let 's just take a look at why he 's still looking so hot and why we should n't get optimistic about the jebs and marcos of the race first there are too many of these establishment type candidate and they spend all their time bashing each other for a particularly embarrassing example of this 'kill the other electable guy ism go here but even if this crowd suddenly thins out i 'm still skeptical that anyone is going to be able to stop cruz or trump more on that in a moment but for now let 's look at the early state particularly new hampshire which is long fetishized by establishment gop consultant because it 's supposed to be where all the nice moderate republican are the one who always go for the romneys and mccains after some crazy person win iowa this time around however trump is by all account running away with new hampshire with the rest of the field stuck squabbling over a distant second place finish that probably ha to do with the fact that trump doe quite well with those nice moderate republican in fact they 've been an important part of his coalition all along which belies the idea that he 's filling the role of right wing radical we 've seen rise and fall in previous year and that 's an important point because the theory of someone overtaking trump and cruz depends a lot on the idea that there 's a natural order to gop primary the base spout off various unelectable candidate rise to the top of the poll and then the moderate turn out to crown their champion the eventual nominee while conservative fall in line because they want someone who can beat the democrat you know someone like romney and here we are with trump looking like he could potentially do a well with moderate to liberal republican a good old mitt that 's not to say that trump will definitely be the republican nominee charlie cook think that eventually republican voter will eventually sour on trump after they 've finished 'venting their spleen start taking the donald 's unpresidential temperament into consideration and settle on another candidate most likely cruz ross douthat who is a pessimistic about trump 's chance a anyone the right recently suggested a rather similar theory and also identified cruz a a major beneficiary of a late stage trump collapse both of these scenario are at the very least plausible and underscore why cruz still ha a real shot at the nomination plus a cruz victory would likely keep the party more or le intact while a trump win at least raise the prospect of a split preventing the all out dissolution of the gop may in the end prove to be a powerful motivator among republican voter and cruz could at least promise to keep the party united through the election that 's a strange place to be in with cruz a the peacemaker in a party that look increasingly open to nominating a liberalish reality show star with an authoritarian streak a much a we 've become inured to the idea of donald trump transforming himself into a political figure of real consequence picturing him giving a state of the union address is still almost too absurd to comprehend how could america elect such a man and how could someone a profoundly unlikeable a cruz really emerge a the sensible alternative the last hope for keeping the gop at least somewhat recognizable for many of the people in my profession that 's going to take some time to absorb a large portion of that america outside the bubble is lashing out against it elite and the institution they run from the major party to big business from the medium to the federal government the reason for this are too many to flesh out here but after decade of stagnant wage pronounced economic inequality crumbling infrastructure and a series of lost and unnecessary war the people who have run our political system and that included the press that cover it have invited a populist revolt and i suspect the political medium 's inability to understand and anticipate the appeal of trump and cruz in part stem from the role we played in the destabilization that produced them we 're all pauline kael now,50389.0

also by his word in the middle of the ukraine crisis while the russian medium wa vilifying the new government in kyiv a nothing le than a 'fascist junta he repeatedly went on record claiming that russian and ukrainian were one and the same people what it meant in practice wa demonstrated in march when the russian troop took over the ukrainian crimea which putin declared a historical heritage site common to the russian ukrainian and belarusian and the place where his namesake prince vladimir ukr volodymyr of kyiv had been baptized russia 's annexation of the crimea made this allegedly common site an exclusively russian possession the view of ukrainian a constituent of the russian nation go back to the founding myth of modern russia a a nation conceived and born in kyiv kiev in the tenth and eleventh century during the time of st vladimir it wa first widely disseminated in russia by the synopsis of the first printed 'textbook of russian history compiled by kyivan monk seeking the protection of the muscovite tsar throughout most of the imperial period ukrainian were regarded a little russians'a vision that allowed for the existence of ukrainian folk culture and spoken vernacular but not a high culture or a modern literature that vision wa challenged in the aftermath of the revolution of when the ukrainian were recognized a a distinct nation in cultural but not political term the leader of the soviet union recognised the russian ukrainian and belarusian to be separate nation but on the eve of the soviet collapse alexander solzhenitsyn had insisted that ukraine belarus and northern kazakhstan should merge with russia this vision did not materialize after the fall of the ussr but neither had it disappeared entirely since the fall of the soviet union the russian nationalist project ha embraced the idea of the unification of the eastern slav on the basis of the russian language and culture this vision of greater russia found a lot of government support and wa backed by the russian orthodox church through the 'russian world foundation which ha been tasked with the promotion of russian language and culture abroad and the 'formation of the russian world a a global project ukraine ha become the first testing ground for the promotion of the new model of russian identity outside the russian federation the chance are it will not be the last the revival of imperial era russian nationalism threatens not only the sovereign east slavic state of ukraine and belarus but also other post soviet republic with significant east slavic and russian speaking populations'estonia latvia and kazakhstan so what about russian in ukraine the russian annexation of the crimea and the propaganda intended to justify russian intervention in the donbas have proceeded under the slogan of defending the right of ethnic russian and russian speaker in general the equation of the russian language not only with russian culture but also with russian nationality ha been an important aspect of the world view of many russian volunteer who have come to donbas one problem with that interpretation of russianness is that while ethnic russian are indeed a majority of the population in the crimea and make up large minority in part of the donbas most of the population of the projected new russia consists of ethnic ukrainian while russian and separatist propaganda ha had an appeal for many ethnic ukrainian most have refused to identify themselves with russia or with russian ethnicity even a they continue to use the russian language that wa one of the main reason for the failure of the creation of a buffer state of new russia by extending the rebel holding in donbas to odesa and kharkiv in southern and eastern ukraine the expansionist model of russian identity which stress the indivisibility of the russian nation closely associated with the russian language and culture presented a fundamental challenge to the ukrainian nation building project from it beginning in the nineteenth century that project placed the ukrainian language and culture at it center but from the outset it also allowed for the use of other language and culture a attested for example by the russian language writing of tara shevchenko whom many regard a the spiritual founder of the ukrainian nation bilingualism and multiculturalism have become a norm in post soviet ukraine extending membership in the ukrainian nation to people of various ethnic and religious background this ha had a direct impact on the course of the russo ukrainian conflict contrary to the kremlin 's expectation russia sponsored 'hybrid war failed to mobilize the support of ethnic russian outside the area either directly controlled by the russian army a ha been the case in the crimea or those part of the donbas seized by russian mercenary and russia backed insurgent according to data provided in the middle of the crisis by the respected kyiv international institute of sociology with russian constituting percent of the ukrainian population only percent of those polled considered themselves exclusively russian the rest gave their identity a both russian and ukrainian even those who considered themselves exclusively russian often opposed russian interference in ukrainian affair refusing to associate themselves with putin 's regime 'ukraine is my homeland russian is my native language and i would like to be saved by pushkin and delivered from sorrow and unrest also by pushkin pushkin not putin wrote one of kyiv 's ethnic russian in her facebook account the russo ukrainian conflict brought to the fore important issue with historical root and ramifications'the unfinished process of building not only a ukrainian but also russian modern nation the russian nationalist ideology harks back to the imperialism of prerevolutionary russia when russian ukrainian and belarusian were viewed by the tsarist government a part of one russian nation because a modern post imperial russian nation ha not taken shape there remains a strong constituency for the idea of a big russian nation and the program of 'reuniting the lesser little and white russian branches'the ukrainian and belarusian nations'with the great russian trunk the adoption of this vision attests to the inability of present day russian leadership to abandon the imperial way of thinking and accept the existence of other east slavic nation russia today face the difficult task of throwing off the historical legacy of empire which prevents it from becoming a modern nation the solution to the russian question lie not in the territorial expansion but in the formation of a law based democratic society capable of living in harmony with it neighbor and playing a positive role in the modern

presidential candidates'barack obama they say is to blame for the american failure to halt the hermit state 's progress on developing weapon normally such a rabid rush to pin a crisis on obama could be shrugged off a partisanship but in this case nuclear nonproliferation expert agree obama they claim is responsible for the failure of america to prevent north korea from expanding it nuclear program america 's strategy on north korea in the first year of the obama administration wa led by the white house and national security council the obama administration concept of 'strategic patience ' emerged early on in the administration after the scathing experience of north korea 's nuclear test the strategy essentially demanded that north korean recommit to concrete step towards denuclearization'such a allowing inspector and freezing fissile material production'as a precondition of any future talk it meant that the administration did n't want to be driven by a dprk orchestrated sense of crisis and would respond in it own time to north korean initiative said scott synder a senior fellow at the council on foreign relation the obama administration came into office with a healthy skepticism of north korea 's ability to follow through on it commitment explains daryl kimball publisher of arm control today given the breakdown of the denuclearization agreement reached under bush the obama administration 'came in with the view that before talk began again north korea should recommit to taking step to show that they were committed to meeting that pledge it is a strategy that ha proven to be a failure giventhe most recent nuclear test north korea ha simply accepted sanction and international isolation a the cost of a slow and steady expansion of it nuclear weapon program the problem with this approach while it is well intentioned and principled it ha not worked the talk have not begun the obama administration did want those talk to happen but they have not begun said kimball today north korea ha enough fissile material for roughly to nuclear bomb kimball added that 's certainly up from where it wa a decade ago it wa perhaps roughly half of that in by demanding that north korean take denuclearization step before talk that would focus on denuclearization it put the onus for talk on the authoritarian state thereby buying them time to creep towards strengthening it nuclear arsenal given that north korea equates it nuclear weapon with the survivability of it regime it is extremely unlikely that pyongyang will take step toward denuclearization absent assurance of the state 's security said kelsey davenport director for nonproliferation policy at the arm control association the overthrow of qadhafi several year after libya gave up it nuclear program likely increased north korea 's concern that absent a nuclear deterrent it regime would be at risk every nuclear nonproliferation expert the daily beast spoke to pointed at the white house and the national security council a the main driver of the 'strategic patience ' strategy i believe the initial thinking on strategic patience came from the white house davenport said snyder added it is hard for me to attribute authorship for policy on foreign affair issue like this one to anyone but the white house nsc if you were observing dprk policy in you would not be focused on state it wa the white house that wa pushing it because they felt that the north korean dissed them by conducting a nuclear test in said joel wit who worked in the clinton administration to resolve the north korean nuclear weapon crisis in the s so when presidential candidate sen marco rubio say that 'north korea is run by a lunatic who ha been expanding his nuclear arsenal while president obama stood idly by and jeb bush blamed the 'obama clinton foreign policy they 're on the mark the national security council declined to comment on the development of the 'strategic patience ' policy 'we are constantly evaluating what more we and our key ally and partner can do nsc spokesman myles caggins said 'our policy ha not changed denuclearization remains our top priority we remain in close touch with our ally in seoul and tokyo a well a the other five party partner on our shared goal of the denuclearization of the korean peninsula in a peaceful manner on the growth of north korea 's nuclear program there is certainly some blame to spread around across administration multiple strategy of engagement then disengagement have been helpless in halting the north korean march to more nuke the hermit state 's first nuclear weapon test for example happened during the bush administration you can say strategic patience is a failure and you can also say engagement is a failure all of the approach we 've used'first to prevent then eliminate north korea 's nuclear weapon program have failed when we 've negotiated it 's failed and when we have n't negotiated it 's failed said gary samore who served for four year in the obama administration a the white house 's coordinator for arm control and weapon of mass destruction there are some problem that ca n't be solved by diplomacy this is one one thing is for sure north korea 's nuclear program ha dramatically expanded over the past decade'during the course of the obama administration'and the threat is now greater than it ha ever been i think that secretary clinton and the obama administration had a false estimation of the behavior of the adversary they are deluded to believe that they have the same standard and commitment that we do'they are outlaw nation sen john mccain told the daily beast they now pose a greater threat now than at the beginning of the obama administration that is irrefutable to address the north korean nuclear weapon program more than finger pointing will be required the response among presidential candidate of both party wa to condemn the nuclear tests'but so far the seeming intractability of the problem ha not been addressed with a viable proposal to confront it when we 're talking about hillary clinton or any other presidential candidate one thing that is absolutely clear is that each one of them if they want to be president will have to develop a more effective approach to deal with north korea they will inherit this problem it 's not going away kimball warned it 's simply not enough to say we need to get tougher ' if there is n't a more sophisticated approach at the end of their first term they 'll be looking at a north korea with dozen of nuclear weapon,20186.0

killmeyer at mac for his one on one tutorial wilwert described an 'immediate connection between ethan and killmeyer who wa completely enamored of ethan 's skill 'it wa such an awesome experience killmeyer told the daily beast 'he wa so amazing and talented that he wa able to do half of his face on his own granted i did his eyebrow and his eyelash but he did everything else killmeyer who ha been a makeup artist for year wa so impressed by ethan and so touched by wilwert 's support for her son 's interest in makeup art that with her permission he posted a picture of him and ethan in drag makeup on facebook it 's clear from the photo how talented and happy ethan is dramatic eyebrow smoky shade of blue around his eye and richly plum lip in a pout that reveals just a hint of smile there is joy in his fabulous fierce expression admittedly this photo is not the 'typical image of a young happy boy'and it fast gained attention being shared by thousand and earning more than like a of january the original post is no longer accessible ' year old fulfills dream of becoming a drag queen heralded towleroad in support 'this kid will grow up to be well adjusted self actualized and will literally give not one f k to the remaining insecure misogynist in our culture who will likely toss out insult at this kid from a place of cowardly anonymity wrote one online commentator in response to the story 'obviously a you are such a trans ally you have no problem with the sexualisation of child posted another 'this kid is dressing a child up a a whore is sick child protection need to investigate this make up 'artist ' perhaps it 's not surprising that the photo of ethan in full drag would not pas through the web without comment but the extreme response are jarring from praise for ethan 's look to alarm bell that he wa being sexualized the viral facebook photo show how much progress we 've made and how far we have yet to come in breaking down gender norm for children'and blocking our adult knee jerk reaction to project our own concern onto them when speaking with killmeyer he emphasized that ethan 's desire to learn how to do drag makeup did not make him a drag queen 'it 's not like he 's running around like that just because he liked watching jeffree star doe n't mean he 's a drag queen that 's the problem i do n't want him labeled he 's young i do n't want him known the rest of his life a the eight year old drag queen because he 's not 'he 's young who know what he 's going to be right now he 's just interested in makeup there are girl interested in playing with truck i just do n't like that it 's being turned into something it 's not necessarily just because he like makeup doe n't mean he 's gay or want to be a drag queen wilwert said that while she ha received mostly support and approval there ha been criticism around whether the makeup 'sexualizes a young child and even in whether it 's wrong for a boy to play with makeup where 'wrong is really a code for 'unusual 'cross dressing 'gay or 'transgender 'most of the backlash come from people who think he 's too young to wear makeup wilwert said she understood the negative 'beauty pageant connotation and that regardless of a child 's gender many people are uneasy with kid being dolled up however wilwert said 'i think people misunderstand it wa a one time fun deal he doe n't even wear makeup in daily life for his parent ethan 's interest in makeup go along with his passion for drawing and other form of artistic expression ethan 's father is a graphic designer and while he and wilwert are no longer together she stressed they co parent and that he and the 'extended family have always been supportive of ethan whatever he want to do whatever he want to be passionate about wilwert said that 'the other backlash is that it 's making him gay wa completely misguided 'this is really not about gender identity or sexual preference it 's about a young boy happening to have an interest in the art it would be no different than a girl liking sport or a truck i think we 're too quick to judge 'people think gender is black and white that if you 're a boy and like makeup you 're gay that 's not necessarily going to be the case this is just a kid being a kid she said that while this photo ha not specifically inspired bullying towards ethan he ha been the object of it in the past 'he 's been called 'gay ' she said 'i do n't see that a a bullying term but it wa used in a derogatory way wilwert proudly noted that ethan is undeterred and will continue to pursue his passion for makeup and other area 'he 's so confident in who he is when he had his makeup on he owned it i think because he 's so confident it make others secure some of the attack have been directed against wilwert a a mother but she wo n't let the hater change her and her family 'i want to say i 'm always going to support my son and what he want to do i know what i 'm doing is right we 're trying to spread a message of unconditional love of your child embrace difference and the unique quality in your child instead of pushing them into what we think or what society think they should be child psychology expert endorse wilwert 's encouraging open minded parenting 'this mom seems really awesome and ha allowed her son to try out different thing dr matthew rouse a clinical psychologist at new york 's child mind institute told the daily beast 'that 's really important for kid a they grow up it 's important they get to try on different idea and way of expressing themselves it 's really normal for kid to experiment with how they express themselves nor did dr rouse see anything overtly sexual or disconcerting in ethan 's example of theatrical makeup 'i do n't see this a a sexual expression i see it a a fun creative way of trying something new out he said rather than worrying about whether wearing makeup wa 'sexualizing a child or creating gender confusion rouse said the concern for parent should be that 'as adult we do n't over interpret these form of experimentation 'if you say to a child 'this is n't an acceptable way of expressing yourself ' it 's like saying 'this is n't an acceptable version of you ' you run the risk of putting down how they see themselves 'it doe n't mean he 's going to grow up to be gay or transgender but if he is gay or transgender a long a the parent say 'we love you and support you ' those are all acceptable outcome wilwert said she ha received message on facebook from people she 's never even met thanking her for encouraging ethan 's creativity and refusing to force him into stereotypical role 'there are a lot of other parent who feel they did n't have a voice until now she said 'we love and accept him no matter what

democratic party chooses sen bernie sander a their nominee the far right might actually have a point sander ' viability in a general election will be affected by his association with radical leftist organization such a the young people 's socialist league or the trotskyist socialist worker ' party especially in in college and his first decade of political activism it 's logical to assume that there will be some sort of'what we used to call 'red baiting ' going on said greg guma the author of 'the people 's republic vermont and the sander revolution who ha known the senator for decade ' can you successfully 'red bait ' in maybe among older people who have a cold war mentality but le so among younger people sander now identifies a a 'democratic socialist and say he is not a capitalist this may not be a dealbreaker among iowa democrat since some percent of likely caucus goer use the word 'socialist ' to describe themselves but guma said sander ' background with leftist group could be used to indicate to democrat that sander who did n't formally register with the democratic party until is n't fully one of them some republican also view element of sander ' early biography a a vulnerability to be exploited 'i have no doubt that bernie 's long standing tie to socialist policy and economics would be used in a national campaign against him said former republican rep bob walker now the executive chairman of the wexler walker lobbying group 'the economic policy that are heavily redistributionist and tax increase oriented would be the focal point of such a campaign in my opinion sander ' association with the radical left is varied'over many year of political development he came to be associated with the youth section of the socialist party the trotskyist socialist worker ' party the anti war vermont liberty union party and the left wing people 's party a a student at the university of chicago sander wa involved in the young people 's socialist league or 'yipsel ' and picketed president lyndon b johnson aide sargent shriver when he visited campus in sander ' senior year according to mother jones ' we will not serve a a front for your capitalist system the group wrote in an open letter in the s sander became involved with the liberty union an anti war political party in vermont in sander ' platform involved the legalization of all drug while in the following year he wrote in an op ed that congress should 'institute public ownership with worker control of the major mean of production several year later in sander told the bennington banner that a 'sane society required that 'capital ha to be controlled by the people sander ran twice for governor and twice for senate under the party 's banner before ultimately leaving the party he wa never really a party guy guma told the daily beast calling sander ' association with the party merely tangential ' his career wa to be a voice and a candidate ' he wa an idealistic young person that 's what he wa still sander wa involved enough that he served a the chairperson of the party for several year in the s in sander backed benjamin spock a a presidential candidate over the democratic candidate george mcgovern spock wa the candidate for the people 's party a now defunct political party than ran in two presidential election spock called for a maximum income of and a minimum annual income of for a family of four spock 's idea were more in line with liberty union a compared to mcgovern 's idea sander said at the time sander also served a a presidential elector for the socialist worker ' party in something that he acknowledged in a television appearance the group at the time wa a trotskyist party that pressed for the abolition of capitalism and the peaceful establishment of socialism 'i wa asked to put my name on the ballot and i did that 's true sander said in the appearance but he insisted he wa never a member of the trotskyist party sander ran and won a narrow race for mayor of burlington vermont in though he ran a an independent he identified himself a a socialist mayor he continued to be an independent until he put himself on the ballot a a democrat in the current presidential race the now senator 's association with various leftist group seem not to have sunk in if they matter at all a large number of democrat seem not to mind over the past year sander ha gradually narrowed a large iowa voter gap with fellow democrat hillary clinton with just day left to go until iowan caucus the huffington post 's poll tracker show sander just three percentage point back from the former secretary of state but the democratic primary and the general election are two different contest among the american electorate there is much le interest in electing a socialist percent of american polled by gallup in june said they could not vote for a candidate that identified a a socialist a compared to percent who could in fact 'socialist ' wa the least appealing of the attribute that the survey company polled but guma the longtime sander watcher said sander ' current idea would ultimately be more decisive than the association he held decade ago i do n't think that

1429,10448566.0,2016-01-31T05:15:00+00:00,'desire ' dylan 's sloppiest masterpiece turn,forty year ago this month bob dylan unleashed desire arguably the most complicated record of his career released during his rolling thunder revue tour the album largely mirror the ramshackle wandering gypsy nature of that beloved jaunt while trying his hand at middle eastern dirge tale of epic adventure and coming off the rail folk rock the legendary musician also waded into journalistic songwriting that failed on many account it 's a sloppy at time plodding affair but it worked the album open with one of dylan 's most controversial song 'hurricane widely considered to be his last great protest song it 's a brilliant eight minute statement against the wrongful conviction of middleweight boxer rubin hurricane carter for a gruesome triple homicide in paterson new jersey much like netflix 's making a murderer it brought a deluge of national attention to the injustice of america 's legal system in using one man 's small town legal fight forty year earlier dylan made carter 's imprisonment an inescapable topic of public conversation the music itself rage at an enthrallingly breakneck pace growing more fiery with each verse'punctuated at one point by dylan 's indignant use of the word 'nigger to scorn those who dismissed carter 's innocence on racial ground but the lyric co written with playwright jacques levy teem with inaccuracy despite the author ' good intention the pair took extraordinary poetic license with the detail of the case originally accusing two star witness of robbing the body left at the scene a problem which resulted in columbia record forcing dylan to re record the song just before release painting carter a a gentle saint neglecting to mention any of his famously violent temper and previous run in with the law and suggesting eyewitness patricia valentine wa part of a police conspiracy to frame carter she sued dylan for slander and lost in court but dylan relentlessly trotted out the song on tour and at benefit show and some credit that increased awareness for carter 's retrial'one which the boxer lost remaining in jail for nine more year until his conviction wa finally overturned dylan 's partnership with levy resulted in another far more questionable journalistic song 'joey the eleven minute ballad is an ode to new york mobster 'crazy joe gallo who wa famously gunned down at umberto 's clam house in little italy levy and dylan paint the brutal mobster a a wrongfully persecuted man of principle 'what made them want to come and blow you away the song 's chorus asks well maybe it wa the fact that gallo initiated one of the bloodiest mob war of the twentieth century and wa a pathological killer who bragged about murdering a man in a barber chair and allegedly ordered a brutal hit on a rival bos one verse claim poor helpless gallo opted not to carry a gun in his later year because he did n't want his child to know violence that would be morally heroic if not for the handgun gallo pulled out while being massacred over his bowl of mussel the song wa indeed 'one of the most mindlessly amoral piece of romanticist bullshit ever recorded a lester bang wrote in but the martyring of such a ruthless figure wa likely the result of gallo 's mythological jail stay in which the gangster read up on nietzsche and befriended black inmate upon his release he moved to greenwich village and befriended actor and literary figures'a hipster goon of sort but the melody is beautiful especially aided by howling backup vocal from emmylou harris and ronee blakley and when taken with some measure of skepticism'as a rewriting of history or a paean to a fictional anti hero'it 's actually a good song flaw be damned interestingly in a interview dylan claimed his partner wa responsible for all the lyric in 'joey perhaps he recognizes the egregiousness of the word too the duo also wrote the piano driven 'isis one of dylan 's most towering allegory a hypnotic seven minute odyssey like fable about a ramblin ' man seeking adventure traveling to 'pyramids all embedded in ice only to discover an empty tomb and return home to his wife a 'mystical child while shrouded in mythical imagery the song wa actually a rare glimpse into dylan 's personal life it almost nakedly mirrored his separation and reunion at the time with sara dylan 'mozambique is a sing songy tune that allegedly emerged from a competition between dylan and levy to see who could find the most word rhyming with the southeastern african country 's name a breezily a the song came to exist it 's perhaps a easy to overlook 'one more cup of coffee valley below and 'oh sister however are indelible classic that see dylan experimenting with melismatic almost rabbinical vocal pattern the former is largely seen a yet another metaphor for his marital estrangement complete with theme of abandonment heartbreak and the unknown road ahead the latter song meanwhile wa a penetrating look at the humanity and fragility of love with scarlet rivera 's violin playing an enormous role in selling the sincerity dylan 's fantastical storytelling took on a new level of screenwriterly attention to detail with 'romance in durango and 'black diamond bay both featured in the latter third of the album 'romance sound read and feel like a non existent sam peckinpah or sergio leone film about a man and his lover magdalena on the run in mexico dust on his face and cape a they flee the law and ultimately perish together in a fatal shootout 'black diamond bay on the other hand is a verbose short story about the inhabitant of an island hotel who each face down their mortality after a volcano erupts and engulfs the tiny landmass the song 's exploration of futility is underscored by the final verse in which the curtain is peeled back to reveal the narrator is just an indifferent viewer of 'old cronkite on the nightly news detailing some mass death or another 'so i turned it off and went to grab another beer dylan sings of his boredom 'seems like every time you turn around there 's another hard luck story that you 're gon na hear and there 's really nothin ' anyone can say and the kicker in our collective gut of apathy 'and i never did plan to go anyway to black diamond bay while each of the first eight song of desire could be the subject of lengthy discussion the album 's closer 'sara is perhaps it most fascinating for one reason it 's the incredibly rare moment dylan drop all pretense of persona and put his personal life on public display if a bob 's son jakob once said 's blood on the track wa ' his parent talking then 'sara is the sound of his parent ending it for good it 's a desperate heartbreakingly intimate plea from dylan for his estranged wife not to abandon him forever with borges like attention to biographical detail dylan reminisces about beach trip with the kid watching them collect sea shell in their pail vacation in portugal and jamaica reading snow white with the child he confesses that he wrote his epic composition 'sad eyed lady of the lowland for sara after staying up all night at the chelsea hotel it 's enough to make the listener cry'a rare feat for the typically biting dylan'especially when he lament that all those beach are now metaphorically speaking 'deserted except for some kelp and begs sara to 'forgive me my unworthiness the famously arrogant dylan wa practically lying naked on the floor weeping for all to see to add to the heartache sara wa present in the studio while dylan and his caravan of collaborator laid down this track she filed for divorce in march,15886.0

oatmeal will provide a stable source of energy that keep you full until lunch you can make this breakfast even healthier by getting creative with your topping say mendelowitz increase the meal 's fiber content by mixing in fresh frozen or dried fruit and or nut and seed such a flax chia and almond if you 're looking to up your protein intake try adding a scoop of protein powder or some greek yogurt to the dish yogurt read your nutrition label when it come to choosing yogurt while it 's high in protein you 'll need to find a low sugar read unsweetened brand to make this a solid breakfast choice mendelowitz recommends choosing greek yogurt here 's how to make your own which is particularly high in protein and pairing it with a few add in in order to prepare a breakfast that keep you fueled all morning mixing in ground flax seed chia seed fruit or whole grain cereal will add more filling fiber to the meal scrambled egg bust out your skillet egg are high in protein antioxidant and vitamin d which make them a healthy and filling choice for any meal 'go beyond the basic scrambled egg and get creative in order to increase the nutritional value of this breakfast option say mendelowitz 'enjoy them with a whole grain english muffin for a filling breakfast full of fiber she say plus if you 're cutting back on carbs this is a morning meal that will still keep you full and you know you want to hop aboard the egg muffin trend cereal cereal could rank a little higher on this list ' or it could rank much lower ahem cap'n crunch 'it all depends on which cereal you choose say mendelowitz 'when selecting a cereal make sure to read the list of ingredient you want to find a product that ha whole grain listed a the first ingredient you might also want to avoid any added sugar in the list of ingredient increase the fiber content of your cereal by sprinkling it with ground flax seed hemp seed chia seed or dried fruit toast skip the bagel and opt for a slice of whole grain bread instead mendelowitz say pair it with a protein and some healthy fat think mashed avocado smoked salmon cream cheese or hummus 'and do n't forget the veggie say mendelowitz 'a great combination is smoked salmon cucumber and red onion ' yum bacon great news meat lover your can eat bacon without fearing for your health mendelowitz say although it 's still important to practice moderation it 's also a good idea to pair bacon with something fibrous 'by itself bacon provides fat and protein say mendelowitz 'but where is the fiber enjoy your bacon with whole grain bread scrambled egg prepared with vegetable and a cup of fresh fruit that will make for a truly balanced breakfast fresh fruit 'fresh fruit make for a wonderful snack but on it own it is n't considered a meal say mendelowitz while fruit do contain healthy fiber they also contain fairly high amount of sugar and they do n't provide much protein for that reason mendelowitz recommends pairing fresh fruit with some lean protein whole grain and vegetable in order to make a more filling and well rounded breakfast pancake or waffle they may be one of the most popular food around but sadly pancake and waffle generally are n't all that healthy that 's because 'they 're mostly simple carbohydrate say mendelowitz ' meaning you 're likely to feel hungry again not long after eating a meal the good news is that there are a few thing you can do to make pancake and waffle a healthier choice choose whole wheat flour add banana cinnamon and or protein powder to the batter and top with fresh fruit instead of sugary syrup donut or pastry back away from that croissant 'the reason these item are least nutritious is because they 're basically all simple carbohydrate say mendelowitz 'although the calorie content is appropriate for breakfast if you eat only one donut and pastry offer virtually zero fiber or protein so they wo n't keep you going throughout your morning,33502.0

donald trump concluded in an interview on cnn after the republican debate reflecting on a relationship that wa that might never be the same before thing fell apart for the star crossed candidate ted cruz and trump long had a non aggression pact it wa sweet cruz defended for trump 's outlandish statement when no other republican would and trump staunchly refused to target cruz because of that goodwill trump ha started to question whether the canadian born cruz is constitutionally eligible for the presidency but even that attack wa delivered much more politely than anything he 's said to someone like jeb bush but now whatever alliance cruz and trump had ha been replaced by all out war in fact the exchange between the two rival did what many thought to be impossible cruz made trump look reasonable and trump made cruz look likeable it started out with a protracted back and forth over cruz 's birthplace 'i recognize that donald is dismayed that his poll number are falling in iowa cruz said in response to a question about the new trump attack 'but the fact and law here are really quite clear under longstanding u s law the child of a u s citizen born abroad is a natural born citizen if a soldier ha a child abroad that child is a natural born citizen trump doubled and tripled down on his charge that democrat would use the fact that cruz wa born in canada to challenge his eligibility do n't blame me he argued i 'm just the bad news bearer the teller of tough truth the keeper of real 'you saw the number yourself nbc wall street journal came out with a poll headline trump way up cruz going down trump said to boo from the crowd 'they do n't like nbc but i like the poll he said trying to hush the crowd and project the vitriol elsewhere 'and frankly it just came out and in iowa now a you know ted in the last three poll i 'm beating you so you should n't misrepresent how well you 're doing with the poll trump glowered throughout their birth certificate back and forth citing harvard professor laurence tribe 's recent boston globe op ed questioning the senator 's eligibility and noting that other legal scholar had expressed skepticism about it a well cruz sounded eager to laugh off the criticism 'i 'm not gon na be taking legal advice from donald trump he said grinning but trump did n't crack a smile trump 's demeanor seemed different than it 's been past debate where he 's made goofy face rolled his eye theatrically and made joke about his republican rivals'especially when that rival 's name is jeb but at the thursday debate that affability wa nowhere to be found later though the tension got even worse cruz ha recently taken to joking about the fact that trump is from new york suggesting that his 'new york value mean he ca n't be a good conservative the issue arose again and cruz looked to keep thing light 'not a lot of conservative come out of manhattan the senator said 'i 'm just saying trump did n't look amused and immediately suggested cruz 's criticism meant he wa being glib about 'i 've never seen anything like it trump said describing the attack 's aftermath 'and the people in new york fought and fought and fought and we saw more death and even the smell of death nobody understood it and it wa with u for month the smell the air trump continued 'and we rebuilt downtown manhattan and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved new york and loved new yorkers and i have to tell you that wa a very insulting statement that ted made a trump monologued cruz looked on in silence wincing and he did n't attempt any retort it take a lot to silence a star college debater like cruz but trump got it done back in september the pair teamed up for a capitol hill rally about their shared opposition to the iran deal and this summer source told the daily beast that cruz wa deliberately wooing the real estate mogul 'in term of trump 's civility if you 're nice to him he 'll be nice to you one source said 'and cruz ha been nice cruz is playing the long game and hope that if he survives and trump doe n't the billionaire will swing to him trump in turn treated cruz with condescending kindness in december trump even issued an extremely rare retraction after describing cruz a a 'maniac the backlash from conservative talk radio wa swift'and trump quickly relented on his attack 'he ha a wonderful temperament trump said at the december republican debate in la vega when moderator pressed him on that criticism 'he 's just fine do n't worry about it and trump gave cruz and amicable pat on the back but that wa before cruz rose past trump in iowa and became a threat to his dominance in the poll trump boast about at every campaign rally and if cruz lost one friend at this debate his relationship with another frenemy somehow got worse a cruz and sen marco rubio continued their feud over their legislative record 'i hate to interrupt this episode of court tv rubio quipped a he interrupted the cruz trump exchange over cruz 's citizenship and launched into his platform later the two launched into a full itchy and scratchy routine over whether rubio wa telling the truth about cruz 's tax plan a well a whether cruz had flip flopped over crop insurance 'i saw you on the senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in iowa rubio charged cruz smiled and then retorted 'i appreciate you dumping your oppo opposition research on the debate stage'at least half the thing marco said were false a the crowd boo 'd cruz trump'ever the opportunist saw an opening 'you think they like each other he said gideon resnick contributed reporting to this story,68530.0

writing came together were refined by the circumstance of our having our daughter it certainly reduced the amount of question that i had to one that had more importance than others basically what are we supposed to be doing here how long have you got and who is going to look after my family when i 'm not around you only draw blank at the end anyway i mean they remain question do you think artist are n't necessarily meant to have the answer just the question well yes i think it 's not bad for artist to continually ask those question in some way or shape because it doe keep referring people back to the fact that we have to live with each other i have all the admiration in the world for somebody like bono who really put himself on the line and try actively to do something about our world situation i 'm crap at doing stuff like that laugh i 'm not one of those guy that ha a great worldview i kind of deal with terror and fear and isolation and abandonment i seem to have this basket of fairly negative take on existence that i continually go back to and circle around and question from a different way in unleashing those fear hopefully it make people look back i do n't do it for a reason i do n't give a fuck what they do with the information i 'm writing it for me and i 'm just glad i 've still got an audience at all art really doe is keep you focused on question of humanity and it really is about how do we get on with our maker culture can also be used for war for patriotism jingoism nationalism all those thing it 's the way you apply your art let 's go back to what you said about the anxiety of the last year what do you think is the root of that how much of it is a lack of spirituality for me very strongly the one thing i felt before everything just got so ooh just dreadfully messy at the end of the s wa there wa an aspect to the s that wa the mission to find what one 's spirituality wa and basically all my life every album i 've made whatever it seemed ostensibly about under all of those thing there wa always a certain angle how do i locate my spirituality what is it i mean my mother wa catholic my father wa protestant there wa always a debate going on at home'i think in those day we called them arguments'about who wa right and who wa wrong 'i 'm going to hell because i married a protestant and i got divorced and the devil will be getting me and quite that kind of talk and it wa really so english working class mother with their 'oh god 's going to pay you back for that laugh it 's always over your head and it wa terrible and for a long time in my teen i escaped off into kind of a wilderness of buddhism and anything that got me out of the trap and the clutch of the judeo christian thing actually it 's a continual endeavor to find what is the essence of all the different religion to see where they link up and is it something that one can have faith in is it something that contains a believability that is going to provide a resolution to your life and optimistically present a conclusion that you are going to be comfortable with pause no laugh but you ca n't but try you continue to go back to it it 's so hard to speak generally i do n't know what the kid on the street think but i do n't feel that there 's any particular question going on spiritually i think there 's a lot of people that are not even really aware that they have the potential for one an emphasis on material good ha kind of displaced that the way we paint our celebrity kid killing kid for a pair of shoe the whole feeling that material good will give you status and happiness and i guess it keep going back to spirituality i think one ha to'in whatever struggle'try and develop a complete picture of what a human being is not just a physical side of a person what space he or she occupies more universally how one 's action can affect the next person maybe because of my buddhistic leaning i tend to work not on such a big plane'i tend to work on if i 'm good to and for my family and my immediate friend then the ripple from those action will be beneficial i really find it tough to think of some person from yugoslavia and have my heart bleed for them it 's a cold thing to say but'i just ca n't i ca n't do it in a general fashion i understand the most extraordinary footage help it doe bring it home i guess connection is really important to keep bringing those thing up it struck me growing up in the s that the s generation had an amazing optimism first of all is that true b is that what gave the music it fantastic energy and c is that optimism missing today i think there is optimism i look at my son for instance and i find an optimism but there 's not the high expectation that people my age had in the s the expectation have definitely been lowered i think the optimism is for about the next year or two at the most it doe n't have a long reach it 's a qualified optimism which is kind of sad i think it 's real tough for a kid who doe n't really know what he 's supposed to do there were way of opting out in the s that do n't seem to exist anymore kid could just run off and be artist and be in band and a lot of people took advantage of that today it 's much more about staying home doing e or rolling for the night'it 's a different kind of optimism i would 've thought the internet would 've opened up a wider network being a communication technology i would 've thought there 'd be a lot more protest of the way thing are one of the song on the new album is called 'afraid i use the line 'i believe in beatles for precisely the same point the beatles could 've been anybody'they 're just the most obvious symbol so i 'm using that 'i believe in beatles a being like why ca n't we have something like that now i 'm just afraid that the only way i can do it now is by corrupting or perverting all i really feel and then i 'll be able to exist i wo n't be afraid what is the root of this cynicism there wa a song by graham nash in the early s 'we can change the world sung completely unironically and we believed it today if somebody put that song out they 'd be lampooned well we 'll buy it if it 's attached to nike i think we believe in the brand we associate a song with the brand it ha more integrity in a way than ever displayed a an autonomous piece i think because it 's hard for anyone to develop any type of overview of anything because of the abundance of information you ca n't take it all in and there is no help available to hone in on the piece of information that you should be taking on board so there 's wonderful stuff to learn and there 's all this crap to learn and it 's all mixed up you do n't know what to take on so you do n't take anything and when you start not taking anything history cease to exist and when you 've got no past you 've got no future because the two are metaphysically linked with each other so you 're just in this crashing now place that doe n't seem to have any door to be opened and you 're trapped in this terrible little rowboat on this sea of chaos and anxiety and terror and it 's like 'well fuck the lot of you i 'm just gon na get stoned i 'm a real self educated kind of guy i read voraciously every book i ever bought i have i ca n't throw it away it 's physically impossible to leave my hand some of them are in warehouse i 've got a library that i keep the one i really really like i look around my library some night and i do these terrible thing to myself'i count up the book and think how long i might have to live and think 'fuck i ca n't read of these book it overwhelms me with sadness ' is rock or even pop music a medium that a musician can grow in should musical growth even be an expectation of rock 'n ' roll it ha been and it always will a long a there are people who can not physically stop making music i do n't mean those who see it a a mean to be famous there are quite enough of those but folk who can not get through a day without attempting to create something that wa n't there before and a long a there is a need on the part of the writer to expand and change the inner motor of the music the vocabulary so to speak there will be an evolving form having said that not much of consequence is going to happen on a broader scale if the industry tilt toward unreasonable profit over nurture and the record industry ha followed the film industry over the last few year if an album is not massive 'out of the box the company move on immediately to the next piece this kill off a lot of new talent before it 's had a chance to even crawl more people will become involved in creating their own music from the 'bits found on the net for instance mash ups the combination of two or three or sometimes up to thirty or forty different song in one piece ha film passed music a the most daring artistic statement medium i 'm not the person to ask i 'm hardly a film buff and i really do n't think it possible to compare the two i do n't see film a that innovative recently only in term of technique but in general that seems to be applied to the most banal and mediocre narrative form digi film ha produced some interesting moment such a the dogme movement i think lars von trier is fascinating his project of shooting three minute of film every year at a different location for his projected release is an extraordinary undertaking christopher nolan of memento fame is also playing around with some lethal and intriguing idea applying technique to great story and philosophical idea billy liar is still a basket of future film in my book schlessinger really got it right in that one almost everything that come out of hollywood is crap there is reasonable cause to suggest that music is way ahead of film on several front sampling alone is something the film world ha not been near yet except in the most syrupy fashion forrest gump say i would love to see a mission to create a full head on movie assembled with only piece of existing movie combining citizen kane pi and some borsalino it would be an exhilarating process for anyone brave enough to attempt but what do we get a re make of tarkovsky 's safari with george clooney where did you record heathen it wa called 'allaire and it 's past woodstock on top of a mountain it 's the last kind of place i 'd expect to work 'cause i 'm a real city person i love writing and working and recording and being and socializing in a city all my life i 'm city oriented the studio wa a paint industrialist 's summer estate the only property on the top of this mountain overlooking like mile degree everything it wa built in the s it ha a kind of nautical flavor to it there 's a lot of varnished wood like you see on those old yacht in that period the ceiling are maybe foot high and maybe foot window looking up in those window at six seven in the morning'i get up incredibly early i 'm in there working at in the morning just playing the synthesizer the piano and working on what we 're going to do that day'and i 'm looking out at the deer and i do n't believe this is happening to me the serenity and the majesty of it how beautiful the world is and it all started coming in and i wa honing in on what it is i really had to say about my life it wa magical now i 've done that i do n't know if i could ever repeat that experience i 'm quite buoyant and cheerful and always on the go and i wa suddenly'uh oh'reflecting and it wa n't really me but i reflected with such intensity and it came over me like a wave it really did some morning i wa literally cry when i wa writing a song which place ha been the best for you artistically i think every album ha been directly influenced by the place i wa focusing in on at the time even though ironically low wa pretty much recorded in france it smack of berlin in those day that city left an indelible impression and i had been mesmerized by it the sense of abandonment the tight strangled feel of a community under siege time had stopped somehow kyoto should also get a mention i think i never recorded there but the serenity i found on my frequent visit ha always stimulated a new approach in some way london and ziggy of course go hand in hand laugh it is such a british album in retrospect you can really hear a sea change by the time i got to america and came to record 'jean genie and yes heathen could not have sounded the way it sound had we not recorded it at allaire i once saw a documentary on marc chagall and wa struck by the fire in his eye at 'he wa still curious and so engaged by life you seem to have the same insatiable drive do you oh absolutely you know bill wyman started growing wine when he wa living in the south offrance he had a few plot and some vineyard and he said 'i 've got this artist who life next door and i called on him '' mr chiggle '' and i asked him if he 'd do the label for my bottle and the old fellow said 'yeah i 'd love to do it ' and he 's given me all these different idea for label on my bottle i only just found out it wa marc chagall 'you draw do n't you could you do me a label for my bottle ' laugh in london they 're just setting up the picasso matisse show it 's the first time that they 're being pitted against each other in a big retrospective for year a very precious matisse and the wild bohemian picasso matisse got a letter in the first world war saying that camouflage had just been invented by the french and they got the idea from the cubist and they had only cubist artist do their camouflage because obviously cubist understand breaking form matisse 's letter from one of his mate on the front said 'you know you 'll never believe this but they 've taken one of your rabbit and one of picasso 's rabbit and they put them on the camouflage and all these fight have been breaking out amongst soldier about which rabbit is better and then that suddenly became argument about who 's the better painter you 're on the front line shell exploding everywhere and you 've got french soldier discussing the merit of matisse and picasso the great thing is the debate is still raging today when that show go up it will happen all over again 'who 's the better painter doe it fucking matter yes it doe yes it doe it 's good to take good long drink from the past and understand what made u who we are how we are and how we tested ourselves in certain situation and from the proof of that define our life now and see our way to the future that 's what piss me off about people who do n't have any interest in the history of our culture or any culture and learning from one ' mistake a lot of music today express hopelessness or resignation where is the hope what is it i have to bring it down to my own little brief on this album ostensibly what might be a relationship song between a woman and a man is mainly addressed to a spiritual intelligence let 's leave it at that i 'm so useless at actually describing what it is i am talking to'is it life itself is it god so a universal agent'intelligence'that 's what it 's really addressed to i can only for me in my life work out a kind of a morality that i 'm comfortable living with that doe not harm anybody else this is such a complicated world that i do n't think i can make it anymore complicated the easiest and most simplified version of doing good thing for me is living a full day and saying 'now wa i an asshole to anyone today should i apologize to anyone today did i do the right thing if i can do that then i do n't think i 'm fucking up i really like the writing on heathen for instance 'afraid 'what made my life so wonderful what made me feel so bad i used to wake up to the ocean i used to walk on cloud if i put faith in medication if i can smile a crooked smile if i can talk on television if i can walk an empty mile then i wo n't feel afraid no i wo n't feel afraid what are you getting at i think that 'an empty mile is a journey with no purpose it 's a journey because that 's the road that everybody 's supposed to walk it 's like being in the army sometimes being in society'do this do that and then you find out that the authority did n't really have a reason but felt they ought to tell you to do something but if we do this everything 's going to be fine fun there is no reward what is 'i used to wake up the ocean i guess it 's a really obscure reference to king canute'who said he could push the ocean back i corrupted it a little bit i kind of made it well if i can make the ocean dance i have such a creative and life control something like that i 've lost that kind of control now i 've got to be medicated to go through this world not that i am 'i got so lost on the shore you sing in 'afraid where do you get lost well again i have to qualify the song in a much a it 's probably a much 'faction a it is autobiographical it 's trying to harness little thing that have happened in my life to a fictional situation but probably this album is a lot le fiction and a lot more of the fact in this one i think i 'm just using the idea that we do lose our way in our life i 've gotten frustrated and irritated and sometimes angry with the way life is at the moment and you feel so vulnerable and kind of small i just wish i could cope better is really what i 'm saying the thing with song is that it 's so hard to take them a just piece of poetry because they work a a vehicle for an expression of an idea a the combination of the music the sound the feel of the music and the lyric that give it it power sometimes you can just look at the lyric and say 'this is tosh but when i heard him sing that i knew exactly what he meant wow did he describe that situation so well but it 's not particularly me i 'm just rearranging a little i 'm feeling for a guy who felt that once upon a time he had some kind of understanding of what wa going on and now he 's terrified 'cause everything is all coming in on him and the only way he can see to surviving is to just do whatever he 's told to do and he ca n't be himself anymore just going down this awful ugly road through life what 's your favorite song you ever wrote and is there a particular reason it 's the favorite sheesh right now i would say the song 'heathen it came pouring out one morning at the studio up in woodstock i had little or no control over it it had me in tear a i sang it it felt like it wa being plucked from my very being an epiphany of sort it seems to be a summation of some kind and i think will become a personal milestone of some sort to me it contains for me a strong indication of how beautiful and wonderful life is and how i regret that i will have to relinquish my hold upon it i could only have written it at my present age likewise 'absolute beginner ha an uncontrolled passion within it'i 'm really showing my emotional map here are n't i it is the best of very few love song that i 've written and mean a lot to me a song i still really enjoy singing is there a song you regret writing on any level apart from just crap song possibly i do n't know there wa a very nasty period in my life around station to station when i wa going through a lot of really bad dark negative nasty nasty black shit'it wa horrible'and i wrote this song 'station to station about this particular period because it wa so tied to cabalism and magic and all that it wa just horrible i wa really falling into an abyss that wa a make or break point of my life i could 've died through that i wa in terrible serious physical decline through drug i wa just out of my mind and when i 'm on drug you would n't want to know me i 'm hyper at the best of time i mean you want to see me on fucking speedballs oh man i wa impossible i also know 'station to station is one of the best piece that i wrote structurally'it 's really an exciting piece it 's that i 'm very ambivalent about the lyric'no i 'm not ambivalent about the lyric it 's a very nasty lyric it 's not a good lyric i started playing it on stage recently and it 's not the most pleasant thing i 've picked to sing maybe i 'm talking myself out of doing it again on my next tour 'tvc is one of my favorite song and 'stay and they 're both on that album you know that 'tvc wa written before poltergeist several year before it 's exactly the same scenario my girlfriend is being sucked into the television she exists in the television i should 've written that film ha rock 'n ' roll lost it ability to be novel to surprise to define a moment in time i think it can still surprise still be novel but unfortunately i do n't think the weight of it currency is a important anymore and it saddens me only because the passing of anything is sad'until you accept that all thing pass'but i think a a vocabulary for the description of rebellion and creating dialogue about change i think it doe n't have that weight anymore because it 's been turned into a commodity not that a commodity is a bad thing either i think popular music is just not what it wa at first'how it first evolved it wa a force for change for fun and for excitement and so hard to get hold of in the beginning now that it is so accessible and there are thousand album released a year it occupies a different space in kid ' life and i 'm not sure if there is a replacement for it i do n't know if there ha to be a replacement for it it is what it is the internet is going to change it even further the s wa the beginning of a change'the s wa really when the change kicked in but it 's got to be intimate if it 's gon na act a the guttenberg press of our time guttenberg realized that the word could be taken away from the priest ' control that it wa n't manna from heaven anymore the word'this priceless thing'could be disseminated in such a way that everybody on earth could not only receive the word but exchange it and interrelate with each other and have dialogue and all that the word changed completely and irrevocably and i think the internet is going to do that with music kid are downloading piece and remixing them and sending them off to a friend who 's sending them back and i 'm sitting here'the author'am i still the author it would n't surprise me within year if there wa no copyright and absolutely no recording industry the recording industry ha no idea what to do and the internet by the month is getting more sophisticated faster and when everybody ha broadband'which ha to happen'woe betide anybody who think the music business is a place where they can clean up financially it wo n't exist maybe it will be just about putting music out to advertise the fact that you 're doing show somewhere i 'll be i 'm tired man that 's all that i can do write music to inform people that i 've got a show coming up i mean ozzy maybe that 's not what i 'll be doing because he 's just become this junk culture thing what is he for it 's amazing it 's really odd what a phenomenon that massive and overwhelming kind of publicity doe that exponentially do anything to the album i wonder because now he 's a cultural icon which actually is a real difficult thing to do anything with you become pamela anderson and you do n't actually do anything but you 're huge i can 't tell whether he 's done himself a favor or something that 's going to negate his being a musician and a rock artist a well he might have divorced himself from that who do you think is making really interesting fresh music these day that change from month to month i love mouse on mar and hangedup also god speed you black emperor are very interesting i have a big thing for both dandy warhol and grandaddy a they have element that remind me of my own youth mercury rev is always worth a listen visconti of course did the string arrangement for them i love lndia arie is there ever a private moment when you talk to david jones the self you left behind year ago i 've not ever been asked that quite in that way before i 've really had to reflect upon how much i 've been absorbed into the david bowie persona it 's such a funny thing to answer is it more than just a name change or have i symbolically'by changing my name so early on'have i given myself permission to completely change the way my life would 've gone have i given myself permission to not be who i thought i might have turned into or have i in fact actually just turned into the person i always should 've been because i 've been through so much i sometimes wonder 'you know your dad would 've been okay with what you are now he could n't have put up with a lot of what happened before i ask myself 'would dad like me now and i kind of keep saying 'yeah i think he 'd like me now is this what david jones turned into or did david bowie allow david jones to become this would i turn into this anyway i do n't know all our life split every day in miniscule way but your life really split wa david jones on his way to be a shop salesman or a bad boxer no he wa on his way to being a bad visualizer at an advertising agency my first love wa art i just found myself a a commercial artist'soul destroying work we had a product called 'aids it wa a slimming biscuit i actually did paste ups for aid then there wa a raincoat that former british prime minister harold wilson used to wear it came from up north anyway we had the account i thought what am i doing i wanted to be matisse or picasso'one of those guy this is awful i wa doing rock at night and there wa a point where it would be the same amount of money'well i 'm doing great with both job if i just had one of them i might make a real breakthrough so i tossed the commercial artist job i could 've done a saatchi i know i could i 'm great with ideas'i can see thing if i had stayed in advertising i might well have had a new bond st agency that 'd be very funny,16206.0

educational and professional opportunity for woman at home though i had two degree there wa no appropriate ph d program for me in turkey i wa lucky enough to receive a scholarship that covered my tuition in a ph d program and a small teaching assistant salary in the u s and i wa eager to join my many friend who were studying abroad and to grow from the diversity and different culture in the state i can not compare my status then with that of today 's syrian refugee but even under my different circumstance the transition from one culture to another wa hard and i did n't always feel welcome not speaking english fluently and not understanding american culture were the greatest early challenge i faced with outcome occasionally funny but often disheartening and cruel to earn my scholarship i wa ironically assigned to teach public speaking while i wa barely able to craft a sentence in english i wa beyond embarrassed to be in front of the student when i first arrived in the united state i wa very lonely and found it difficult to make connection once in a thrift store while talking in turkish with a friend we were scolded and told 'you are in the u s so speak english i often wanted to participate in the conversation around me i would have a great story to tell one that could make people laugh but i did n't have the fluency or vocabulary to tell it i kept a lot in my heart i can not even imagine the challenge of being a syrian refugee without the resource i had trying to adapt to living in a foreign land one big challenge these refugee face is the current political landscape in which american politician are using a fear based rhetoric that suggests muslim refugee will become terrorist or criminal or dependent of the state not only will they face similar difficulty to mine a they assimilate culturally but will be faced with an irrational fear and preconceived notion upon arrival while it is possible in theory from my experience it is highly unlikely that a terrorist disguised a a syrian refugee would be legally admitted to the united state given the comprehensive nature of the current immigration process in order to be admitted to the united state i submitted a huge folder including bank account real estate and car ownership tax return health insurance documentation pay stub employment letter pay slip admission letter from the university where i wa to work an i document that is sent by the u s government airfare ticket visa application form visa application fee etc there wa a long wait for the background search and all applicant were interviewed by an embassy officer who compared data collected to interview answer the existing admission process is so thorough that a syrian with a criminal or suspicious background would have a very difficult time being granted admission due to the involvement of the united state in war in the middle east there is a lot of hatred against the country a quick google search uncovers countless article about hatred against the united state including ' country that hate america most and eight of these nine country are in the middle east even in turkey which ha not been in active combat with the united state the revulsion towards the nation is obvious in istanbul and the u s consulate there is rightly fearful of terrorist attack after the istanbul bombing the embassy moved from a central location in the city to a surreal giant castle on top of a hill away from the city center it foreign policy doe not make the united state a hero in the middle east but by admitting more syrian refugee and offering more aid to them the united state can begin to change it role and reputation not only in the eye of the middle east but in the eye of the entire world two hundred and twenty thousand people have died in the syrian war and million more have fled the country a refugee yet despite u s involvement in the war it ha admitted only syrian refugee since for syrian finding a safe place to live is a matter of living or dying the united state could admit more refugee and welcome them in way that enable them to create root here of course not all american are turning a blind eye to the syrian refugee crisis some choose to convey the story of syrian refugee in creative way such a brandon stanton with his photo website human of new york in order to create awareness some choose to donate money some community choose to invite and host more refugee but we need more american to turn away from their electronic gadget and entertainment distraction and stop blocking out the tragedy they may think 'if we do n't hear it maybe it doe not exist but it doe we need to help and when they arrive we need to welcome them with kindness and compassion ozge samanci

graham would be screaming from the rooftop fox news would break into it coverage of christian victimization to do a special report on it and of course gop presidential candidate like ted cruz would be calling this a 'jihad on christian just a he ha used that term to attack lgbt advocate of marriage equality but when muslim were fired from their job in colorado a few week ago for simply wanting to take short prayer break we did n't hear a peep from these so called advocate of religious liberty but that probably come a little surprise to most religious liberty'in the view of some on the right'is only for christian in fact a poll released last week made that very point it found that percent of american believe preserving religious liberty for christian wa important however only percent said the same about muslim 's right to practice their faith that number wa even lower among republican the poll also found that only about percent of american believe that religious liberty for jew wa important meaning that there are roughly million adult american who do n't view judaism a being on equal footing a christianity this again prof that when some talk about judeo christian value the christian part of that phrase far outweighs the 'judeo part thankfully for jew muslim sikh hindu and people of other minority faith or no faith we are statutorily guaranteed religious liberty at the workplace by way of the civil right act of this iconic law provides among other thing that employer are required to provide a 'reasonable accommodation so that employee can practice his or her faith now that doe n't mean that the employer ha to accommodate every religion related request a person make if the accommodation will cause an 'undue hardship on the employer they do n't have to grant it obviously such a determination is fact specific but the eeoc ha provided a few example of typical religious accommodation these include if an employee need an exception from the company 's dress code for religious reason such a an orthodox jew wearing a yarmulke another wa a christian employee at a pharmacy not be required to fill birth control prescription or an atheist being excused from the religious invocation at the beginning of a staff meeting well that brings u to the case of the muslim employee who were recently fired by cargill meat solution at it fort morgan colorado plant now just so it 's clear cargill is not some horrible anti muslim company to the contrary for year cargill ha accommodated the muslim worker who wanted to take short break for their daily prayer devout muslim will pray five time a day but still at the end of the day there are muslim mostly united state citizen who were fired because of their desire to practice to faith and take two to three short break during the day to pray jaylani hussein a spokesman for and an executive director of the council of american islamic relation minnesota chapter explained to me that cargill had for year allowed the muslim employee to take prayer break at this location with relatively no issue and keep in mind the muslim employee would work on the christian holiday so that the christian employee could practice their faith but a few week ago a dispute arose when a supervisor apparently told worker they could no longer pick their own break time to pray but instead would need the permission of a supervisor to go pray when some of the muslim employee pressed the supervisor about when he would release them to pray they were reportedly told by the supervisor 'if you want to pray go home that sparked a walk out by some muslim employee thereafter hundred of them remained home in protest of what they viewed a cargill revoking their religious accommodation to pray cargill then fired muslim employee who refused to return to work until they were provided assurance that they could take prayer break a cargill spokesperson responded on twitter to me that the company respected people 's right to pray and noted that 'our muslim employee are still taking prayer break at work from an outsider 's point of view you would think this would be an easy to case resolve but a former trial lawyer i can tell you that this is a typical scenario where the party are not that far apart but still a resolution ca n't be reached so here the party stuck at this impasse a of monday hussein wa still in talk with cargill he did lament that while the employee are part of the teamster union it 's a mandatory join the union ha refused to help hussein even traveled to the union 's local office but wa told by the representative that he had no time to talk for the foreseeable future translation the union did n't believe it wa important enough to expend capital in fighting for the right of the muslim employee to pray the hope a hussein noted wa to resolve this dispute amicably which is typically how most religious accommodation case end up but if that doe n't happen they will certainly explore their legal right provided by the civil right act and given recent poll that show barley a majority of american support religious liberty for muslim it make me appreciate even more the wisdom of the drafter of that landmark law who had the foresight to ensure that our right to religious liberty is not subject to a popularity contest,33389.0

for manitowoc county wisconsin man steven avery the subject of netflix 's hit docuseries making a murderer speaking with the daily beast wednesday night from milwaukee avery 's former counsel dean strang challenged the supposedly damning evidence used to convict avery in for the murder of photographer teresa halbach despite the plethora of hole that have outraged viewer since the series ' debut 'this is a case where i think substantial real and reasonable doubt remain about whether an innocent man got convicted declared strang earlier in the day the bespectacled attorney found himself sparring with former calumet county district attorney ken kratz on fox news a both men argued over the case they debated in and out of court a decade ago among the contested item of evidence the bleach stained jean of avery 's then year old nephew brendan dassey who told investigator in a controversially obtained confession that he helped avery rape kill and burn halbach 's body bone identified a halbach 's found in avery 's burn pit'but which were most likely burned elsewhere then moved leg iron and handcuff supposedly purchased by avery which were never admitted a evidence in avery 's trial and call made from avery to halbach who had requested she return to the avery salvage yard after previously photographing the family 's vehicle for auto trader magazine kratz meanwhile emphasized what he described a the case 's 'most persuasive evidence that investigator found avery 's dna on the hood latch of halbach 's rav which had been discovered on the avery property concealed in branch the only problem none of avery 's fingerprint were found in or on the car speaking with the daily beast strang scoffed at kratz 's conclusion 'mr kratz feel aggrieved that the evidence of steven 's dna on the hood latch or under the hood is left out of the film but there were also no fingerprint there if the dna transfer wa from his skin to the hood where are the fingerprint and you have probably both hand on the hood'potentially eight or ten finger that could leave at least a partial print the fingerprint issue also raise question about one of the prosecution 's primary piece of physical evidence he say avery 's blood found smeared inside halbach 's car supposedly from a cut on his finger'and yet no fingerprint 'you have a problem because if he 's wearing glove how 's he bleeding said strang incredulous 'how 's he bleeding externally and where are the bloody glove that became a problem for the state because if he 's wearing glove that explains why there 's no fingerprint but then how is there blood if he 's not wearing glove blood could be dripping from a cut okay but then why are there no fingerprint 'look there are n't always fingerprint he continued 'but that is a problem because the state think he drove the car you ca n't do that without grabbing the steering wheel you ca n't turn the key in the ignition without potentially touching thing you ca n't open a car door without using your hand and leaving a fingerprint potentially unfortunately for avery and co counsel jerry buting the defense 's framing theory'that avery 's blood had been planted inside the car by overeager law enforcement officer trying to ensure his conviction'was stymied in turn by four letter edta 'initially we were told that the test had n't been done since the o j simpson trial that they could n't be done it would take week or month said strang of the fbi laboratory test the prosecution used to argue that there had been no tampering with avery 's blood sample 'we had to have a hearing out of the jury 's presence to see if it wa going to be admissible he said 'we had no chance at that point to do independent testing or even to react terribly well to it because we 're being handed the report during trial and then boom ' expert witness mark lebow is on the stand the next morning at the time of avery 's trial wisconsin state law did not require a daubert test to hold expert testimony to a higher level of scrutiny'a standard he note that the state did begin enforcing in the last few year 'jerry did try to show that this wa n't even relevant evidence'that it did n't clear wisconsin 's low bar of admissibility strang explained 'but the judge ruled against u on that jerry in front of the jury then tried to establish that there were reason to view the fbi 's hasty work a unreliable 'i think it wa a point at which momentum shifted he sighed 'and maybe not fairly strang and buting also found their hand tied when they attempted to introduce four alternate possible suspect who might have killed halbach but wisconsin case law requires defense to prove motive in said suspect which they could not do 'that is a significant asymmetry because the prosecution in a murder case and most other case in wisconsin never ha to prove motive against the person on trial strang said 'but steven avery did n't have any motive either he had nothing against halbach she had n't done anything to him there wa nothing to suggest he had any motive or some reason to want her dead'and the state doe n't have to prove motive strang declined to identify the four unnamed possible suspect he and buting proposed in their motion or confirm that they were the quartet avery later named in a appeal filing pointing to dassey 's brother bobby stepfather scott tadych and avery 's own brother charles and earl 'i 've never seen that filing said strang who admits he 'unplugged soon after the avery conviction citing the exhausting seven week trial it wa prudent then for new lawyer to take up avery 's cause post trial 'i do n't want to undermine him strang said declining to comment on avery 's accusation like every making a murderer obsessive strang took note of the revelation this week by filmmaker moira demo and laura ricciardi that an unidentified juror belief avery wa framed and that said juror feared for their own safety if they did not vote to convict during the trial he declined to comment on whether that juror 's story might help spur a second chance for avery he confirmed that he and buting had concern about the juror revealed to be the father of a manitowoc county sheriff 's deputy'but not a much a they had over the six potential juror they struck during jury selection exhausting their maximum strike 'you do n't pick a jury all you can do is unpick the people you think least fit to serve on the jury he explained 'but the concern about six other potential juror were greater although he vividly remembers detail of the avery case strang discovered material he 'd never before seen regarding the dassey case that clearly now trouble him in the documentary he express guilt over seeing dassey drown in the legal system that would eventually send him to prison for life the teenager 's story is making a murderer 's more heartbreaking thread a taped phone call to his mother and footage of his confessional session with investigator indicate he ha no concept of how badly he 's incriminating himself strang wa particularly shocked he say watching video of dassey 's session with the investigator hired by his own defense that attorney len kachinsky ha since admitted to screwing up his own client 's case by serving him up to federal investigator whose taped interrogation of dassey also alarmed strang 'why do we allow the police to pull a developmentally disabled immature unsophisticated boy out of class without his parent and take him off and interview him in a manipulative psychologically sophisticated way with two intelligent adult men'teamed up against a developmentally delayed year old na ve boy strang demanded how possible wa it that dassey a the film suggests instead fabricated the halbach rape and murder scenario used to convict him because he 'd seen the movie kiss the girl 'i think there 's a good chance of that said strang 'and the similarity are eerie that 's a movie i think that would have made a pretty graphic impression on somebody his age he probably should n't have been watching it there is one answer for the kind of question and inconsistency that plagued both the avery and dassey case he say reasonable doubt 'guilt ha to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt if there is reasonable uncertainty we err on the side of liberty there is a question here of whether that standard wa really faithfully applied'or whether the jury could because of all the awful and largely inadmissible pre trial information they heard over and over and over again in the more than a year leading up to this trial strang hinted that he and buting may return to avery 's side to fight for a new trial that could exonerate avery'again 'jerry and i both have always been in touch with steven on and off said strang who now lead his own law firm strang bradley llc in madison buting is a partner in buting williams stilling s c an hour away in brookfield wisconsin 'it 's clear that he probably need formal legal representation for the specific concrete thing that a lawyer can do in the coming week and month 'it would depend on what he want for one and two whether any future legal step might involve examining whether jerry and i dropped the ball in some way'whether we were inadequate or the legal term is ineffective in some way if some possible avenue of relief might be raising question about our performance or criticizing our performance then we should n't be the one to do that 'he 's not going to be able to pay anybody he added 'money is n't in the equation but what is right now in our eye is what 's best for steven strang readily admits he think it 's possible that avery is guilty but he argues 'if our system worked on convicting people on maybes then everybody could pat themselves on the back and go out and have a beer convicting a man on a maybe our system is n't supposed to work on convicting people on maybes 'in our system if we live the value we profess that mean you get to keep your liberty he continued 'that mean you do n't spend the rest of your life in a cage could he be guilty sure he could do i think he wa proven guilty no do i think there 's a real strong chance he could be innocent yes but that 's just me i wa n't asked to decide,312870.0

focus on snohomish county washington where last friday a group of seattle area juror found the so called delta not guilty of obstruction for blockading a regional oil facility in the protest and the acquittal were notable a part of a growing wave of anti oil gas and coal citizen action that ha swept the country in the past few year and the courtroom in snohomish county wa treated to a master class on why principled lawbreaking is just the tonic needed to cure our government 's woeful inaction on warming but what law student of the future will learn about the delta trial is something a bit more arcane if no le momentous for the first time in the united state a jury heard testimony that defendant ' criminal action were justified by 'climate necessity 'that is the argument that it 's better to break the law while getting in a few punch at the fossil fuel system than to sit back and lawfully watch the world burn it 's a defense that 's been tried a handful of time but in the u s ha never made it past the judge 's bench slap one group of protester used it successfully in england in next on to cortlandt new york where the montrose are facing trial for disorderly conduct after having shut down a construction site along the algonquin gas pipeline in westchester county in november like their brother across the continent these activist have not only broken the rule to save the climate they 've done it loudly and proudly if all go well at their next court hearing on february their trial will be the second ever'in le than two weeks'to air the climate necessity defense in open court this is much more than just legal la di da by slipping into otherwise mundane criminal proceeding a heavy dose of serious discussion regarding the ineptitude of our environmental caretaker and ream of nuanced scientific analysis of the crude oil catastrophe brewing in the northwest'just one of many cause of consternation for climate activist who understand that the time to abandon carbon intensive energy is yesterday'the delta and their legal team and army of supporter are helping to sound the death knell for the 'business a usual of the fossil fuel era the montrose are issuing a similar rallying cry to defeat the pipeline pox currently plaguing the northeast admitting that they 've broken the letter of the law because the government ha whiffed on the biggest crisis of our age these defendant send a powerful signal that the casual destruction of the climate will no longer be met with complacence and silence in a last minute letdown in the delta case the snohomish county district judge barred the jury from actually considering the necessity defense the cat wa already out of the bag by then though and having at least heard the first american climate necessity defense the jury acquitted on the obstruction charge and convicted on trespassing the defendant are appealing that conviction a well a the judge 's denial of their defense in this case a in others that came before it the judge decided that there were lot of thing one should do to fight climate change besides engaging in civil disobedience'at least until the courthouse is underwater presumably the activist are n't buying it a a pre trial brief in support of the washington protester ' climate necessity defense put it 'the expert witness in conjunction with the testimony of the defendant will ' speak directly to the question of whether any reasonable legal alternative to civil disobedience existed with the resounding answer being that no it did not no reasonable legal alternative to erecting a tripod over oil train track or blocking the authorized construction of a gas pipeline it 's a radical argument but it 's one that 's gaining steam in the climate movement the ambitious rhetoric of the paris climate talk and obama 's coal plan notwithstanding we 're still well on our way to an unrecognizably unstable planet even a state and federal agency continue to approve and lavishly fund oil gas and coal project shocking statistic since we 've had of the warmest year on record 's at the top of the list the very fact that the delta got away with arguing climate necessity for most of their trial and that the montrose might do the same suggests that their movement ha shifted it political vision from polite lobbying and consciousness raising to deliberate and eloquent disobedience'a shift of moral emphasis that put climate dissident in line with principled lawbreaker of the past besides tracking the rapid evolution of the climate movement the delta and montrose trial also serve a proof that the public at large is breaking with it government and corporate master over climate politics the defendant in these case have wagered that it 's smarter to break the law first and ask for permission later'and they think that the american people will back them up shocking statistic according to the yale project on climate change communication one in eight american are willing to commit civil disobedience to fight global warming so far the bet look good staging dramatic formalized clash between the climate value embodied by the law fossil fuel extraction is a right a healthy climate ai n't and the climate value of the public rapidly headed in the opposite direction climate disobedients have already translated into legal term a moral argument that would have been unimaginable year ago in washington that legal argument half worked at trial necessity defense denied but obstruction charge tossed out and there 's still the high drama of the appeal ahead the first successful climate necessity defense might come next month in new york'and if not there then somewhere else and sometime soon suffice it to say that the tide is shifting a is so often the case with highly touted legal battle and their small cast of adversary what go down in the courtroom is just a synecdoche for much broader but harder to grasp conflict in society at large climate necessity defendant are convinced that saving the climate requires drastic political reform but that such reform is impossible without shattering the illusion of government accountability take the delta a motley crew made up of a business climate consultant teacher 's assistant coffee house owner retired music teacher and house painter they 'd already petitioned legislator submitted report to their state department of ecology and even written the president before blocking the bnsf rail yard ignored on all front they decided that their only remaining option wa to raise the temperature of political debate so they set up a tripod over the railroad locked their body to it and got arrested for trespassing and obstruction then they took the battle to court and took advantage of the judicial branch 's stubborn attachment to notion like justice fairness and necessity the basic idea turn the climate crisis into a moral and social crisis court are practically the only place left where this sort of righteous appeal to the mass is possible it doe n't take an atmospheric scientist to count the number of major climate change bill passed by congress hint fewer than one and one need only consider the ongoing oregon militia showdown to get an idea of how aggressively our government agency protect environmental resource incidentally the effort by those anti federal activist to set up a sort of shadow government based on citizen grand jury parallel the approach of the climate necessity defendant return environmental power to the people through the democracy of the courthouse the difference the two group see this path leading to directly opposite endpoint a lockean fantasy of unprotected pasture on the one hand or a post carbon community of careful steward on the other recent national reaction to these two northwestern environmental showdown suggest that the latter vision 's got the greater pull time to turn then to the law where there 's at least a glimmer of hope court have tended to treat global warming like the paradigm shattering institution shaking phenomenon that it is and have prudently absolved themselves of responsibility a the supreme court wrote in in aep v connecticut a major multi state lawsuit against carbon polluter 'federal judge lack the scientific economic and technological resource an agency can utilize in coping with issue of this order on the administrative law front environmental lawyer ' knee are shaking a they anticipate the high court 's ruling on the legality of obama 's clean power plan post paris there 's some optimism that our esteemed justice will grasp the depth of the warming problem and the shallowness of congress ' ability to deal with it and give the stamp of approval but an admonitory comment from justice scalia in a major climate case dealing with the epa 's ability to regulate greenhouse gas '' when an agency claim to discover in a long extant statute an unheralded power to regulate 'a significant portion of the american economy '' we typically greet it announcement with a measure of skepticism 'suggests that we might not see our global warming woe solved with the snap of a judicial finger anytime soon so attorney are trying new tactic for example a group of young plaintiff recently sued the federal government for violating various alleged right to a healthy climate including the right to have the government hold the atmosphere in trust for the people but perhaps the most promising route'at least in term of inspiring new wave of activist and of presenting the case for climate justice in the most basic most irresistible term available'lies with the climate necessity defense necessity defense have worked'in the sense of getting acquittal and getting publicity'for numerous social cause in the past antebellum new england jury routinely acquitted fugitive slave and their protector abbie hoffman and jimmy carter 's daughter amy successfully argued political necessity after disrupting cia recruitment at the university of massachusetts in a a new york city judge wrote in in acquitting activist who had blocked the queensboro bridge to protest air pollution 'the defense doe not legalize lawlessness rather it permit court to distinguish between necessary and unnecessary illegal act in order to provide an essential safety valve to law enforcement in a democratic society abby brockway one of the delta defendant echoed those sentiment a few day after her own trial describing how washington state agency have failed to do their job with regard to climate change and crude oil 'they 're just trying to figure out how to approve the permit ' these agency are originally designed to protect the people and represent the people but they 're not'the industry ha taken them the solution 'we do n't have enough time to actually change these systems'so we have to create our own it 's a pretty astute strategy tension making a political praxis ha a long domestic pedigree a basic move of the early american patriot wa to stage confrontation with the british authority to foment anti royalist fervor think boston tea party and the civil right organizer of the ' s and ' s carefully wove together moment of dramatic disobedience to present situation of racial crisis that could be grasped by the complacent american majority think lunch counter sit in in his 'letter from birmingham jail martin luther king jr put it this way 'just a socrates felt that it wa necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individual could rise from the bondage of myth and half truth to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal so must we see the need for nonviolent gadfly to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depth of prejudice and racism to the majestic height of understanding and brotherhood climate activist blocking fossil fuel expansion and singing about a brighter future are nothing if not nonviolent gadfly with our political system at a historical nadir of democratic accountability there are few option for dealing with our addiction to fossil fuels'but one of them involves marching straight into the courthouse and giving the law a chance to self correct an acquittal in a protest case doe n't directly translate into emission cap and carbon tax of course but when jury waive punishment for illegal interference with the oil and gas industry that mean that our corrupt climate destructive power structure is starting to corrode since we ca n't make change without changing policymakers that 's a very good start the year 's just begun many more anti fossil fuel action are in the pipeline with such an auspicious start already there 's a good chance that this chapter of the history of the climate movement'the tale of resistance and rallying of lawbreaking and liberation'will have a happy ending ted hamilton is a student at harvard law school and a freelance writer he ha worked on the climate necessity

bringing me onto the daily show wa the biggest thing for me in my career she said appreciative 'then aaron sorkin'no one to this day ha given me the opportunity that aaron sorkin ha given me those two project come closest to connecting any dot in munn 's career so far she note 'on the daily show i wa pretending to be a fake reporter and on the newsroom i wa pretending to be a real reporter and in real life i majored in journalism that 's the one through line in my career ' maybe that 's what 's allowed munn to hit back at the critic where more conflict averse celebrity might cower and no comment when the jezebel kerfuffle hit she replied by telling her hater to 'just walk it off bitch in a blog post that 's since disappeared from the internet she preempted judgy critique of her maxim photo shoot with a warning ' if you have any problem with me in this spread i have two thing to say to you just do n't look and you sound like you just need a good fuck recently when an espn com

had a dream of being an actor so opportunity came up and i started taking them to see how far it will go never thinking i 'd be able to make a career out of it munn still call stewart her 'mentor and went to him for advice when during filming on the last season of the newsroom she wa n't sure if she should take the ride along gig 'all the hustle wa to get to a place where i could take my time and not just do everything she said but that meant every choice wa weightier every project more strategic 'i wa n't really sure if it wa the next thing i wanted to do'to go from working with aaron sorkin to ride along 'i wa n't sure if it wa the right project for me to do right after an intense season of doing sorkin material stewart 's advice 'he said 'first of all kevin hart is an amazing human being and second of all 'just go have fun you do n't always have to do sorkin and soderbergh just go have a fun time making a fun movie ' 'i think it 's the opportunity that come around that you do n't take that can define your career more she contemplated 'by the way i do n't know if that 's the right thing i may be like 'that wa a dumb decision ' i do n't know how it 's going to work out but this is a little bit in my plan another big opportunity arose when munn met with producer to join the cast of may 's x men apocalypse playing mutant psylocke a fan favorite telepath telekinetic englishwoman whose consciousness is transferred into the body of a lady ninja munn a longtime x men fan knew the role would n't be huge and it would require her donning a revealing outfit that itself ha been the subject of many a fanboy blog entry before taking the part she say she made a deal with producer simon kinberg 'i said 'first of all i love psylocke and i love x men so if you guy are doing it i know that you 're just introducing the character and there are a lot of other element going on with other people and other storyline munn recalled 'it 's the introduction of psylocke so it 's cool if i do n't have a lot of dialogue or there 's not a lot for her to do'as long a she ha a badass fight scene ' he wa like 'okay ' 'i love psylocke she said of the character who in the may blockbuster is one of disillusioned supervillain apocalypse 's mutant powered warrior 'psylocke is awesome she 's really strong and powerful and in a superhero world where so many people have to think before they kill and they do n't always want to she 's never had a problem doing that to me that 's a very badass quality in a villain 'just be lethal and be extremely dangerous and make your opponent fear you a a kid i always thought it wa really cool to see a female like that she said 'even though she ha this really'interesting costume that she ha to wear 'even training just changed my life in a different way to want to work out and be healthy and keep that going and now i have a sword closet so that 's cool she laughed 'do n't come knocking unless you 've been invited if anyone startle me i 've got a sword closet with the presidential election approaching now would be a pretty fun time to be a daily show correspondent munn admits 'i 've been meaning to reach out to jon stewart because i just want to hear his breakdown of the election she said i miss his take on it giving prop to new daily show host trevor noah 'he 's so bright and so funny munn say she still watch every episode 'but

student take off their clothes and bend over for either a violent whipping or forcible anal sex sometimes the priest made them drink red wine sometimes the priest masturbated in front of the child other time they made the child masturbate for them perform oral sex or fondle each other the complaint is not about just one or two isolated case at least and more likely a many a boy who attended the school between and were subjected to what ha been described by the victim a 'ritual abuse according to ulrich weber a german lawyer commissioned by the choir who represents the alleged victim 'i have here report of physical abuse weber told reporter at a press conference in regensburg on friday when he presented a report based on an eight month investigation into the alleged abuse 'the abuse range from sexual assault and rape to food deprivation to the boy who were le cooperative the bulk of the abuse which also included caning forced gluttony and anal penetration with foreign object happened in the mid s to boy being groomed for the world famous domspatzen boy choir of regensberg 's st peter 's cathedral during the time when a certain father georg ratzinger wa the choir leader ratzinger who will turn next month is the elder brother of josef ratzinger better known a pope benedict xvi he conducted the choir from to when asked if ratzinger knew what wa going on weber said 'after my research i must assume so in when hint of the abuse first surfaced the elder ratzinger publicly apologized for 'slapping student but denied being aware of the violent abuse that wa apparently rampant at the school though he apparently hinted that he had heard rumor of abuse taking place on choir trip i always had a bad conscience and i wa happy when in corporal punishment wa banned by lawmaker the

the extent of the sexual abuse at the regensberg catholic school trump original estimate that only a handful of young boy were abused in just two year before benedict retired the holy see insisted that 'the abuse wa limited investigator then put the number of credible complaint at around case for which they offered a settlement sum of around that 's when weber wa commissioned by the domspatzen choir administrator to start collecting complaint so far he ha but he told reporter that he estimate that a many a one third of the student who attended the school over four decade were subject to varying form of unimaginable abuse and maltreatment by those estimate around boy were abused and because the statute of limitation ha long run out and most of the abusive predatory priest are dead

'an elaborate system of sadistic punishment combined with sexual lust he said that he and several other boy were often 'chosen to be invited by the headmaster at the time to his personal apartment where they were plied with red wine and made to perform sex act on the headmaster and on each other 'everyone knew about it at the time he said in whether the elder ratzinger told his younger brother about the abuse remains dubious especially given that the younger ratzinger served a head of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith the church 's former inquisition office that now see to the interpretation and enforcement of church doctrine before being tapped a pontiff if he had been informed he would have been in a prime position to expose it the recent revelation of the extent of abuse will seal benedict 's record on the greatest scandal to rock the catholic church a weak at best the vatican under pope francis ha been far more transparent and apologetic about the crime and systematic cover up of abuse than benedict ever wa but so far even francis ha remained silent on the recent report from regensburg to his credit the current bishop of the regensburg diocese rudolf

wa n't a music industry curio she wa a pop star'a supernova'and she shined bright like a diamond no s ' of them'came with rapid fire ease a if manufactured on a conveyor belt argument raged whether you bowed down queen riri or queen bey she wa n't like taylor swift or katy perry or adele artist who by and large manufactured blockbuster success on the illusion that they could be your best friend if you actually knew them rihanna could never be your best friend she 's far too cool to ever pay you mind her instagram ha no carefully curated photo of her squad and she 's not toning down her 'california gurl eccentricity to present at the golden globe award ' redcarpetgoals no she 's instagramming photo of herself wearing dolce gabbana headphone she walk down red carpet with her nipple out a survey of her post suggest she exists in a permanent cloud of weed smoke oh yes rihanna is cool and that 's precisely why we feel so privileged to scream and shout her club banger watered down vodka soda in hand they are chant of nonsense'pop incantation really 'oh nah nah ella ella eh 'bitch better have my money they are powerful ear worm with booming beat so catchy and so energizing that your excitement explodes a her music crescendoes yes we found love in a hopeless place that hopeless place our existence the object of our affection rihanna for she 's the one who is saving u with her hit her hit and thus lie the problem with anti there are none fan have been waiting nearly four year for rihanna who for the greater part of the last decade ha produced new music at an unfathomable clip riri never left u entirely per se her coolness reigning over scattershot hit like 'bitch better have my money and 'fourfiveseconds neither of those song appear on anti it 's why for many the insufferably teased release of anti is so well anticlimactic the album is a case study in the worst way to release new music perhaps rihanna 's team confused 'ramping up anticipation with 'torturing fan announced release date were missed rumored release date came and went too a world tour wa announced without an album to accompany it she teamed with samsung for the most shameless corporate tie in that any artist of her stature ha ever participated in'baiting fan with hint to her new album 's content without you know giving them any for four year well anti is finally here and it is here without hit nottaone zilch for more than three year fan have been salivating waiting for those juicy banger those dancehall smash those song we wo n't be able to get out of our head and wo n't even want to there 's none of that on anti the question then becomes whether rihanna ha failed u ha pop 's coolest cool girl let u down this is the part though where we laud praise on the album perhaps more than any effort she 's given u before rihanna is an artist here she 's almost unrecognizable in a way that 's musically refreshing her frequent collaborator calvin harris and dr luke are n't there because of the lack of hit some might be tempted to say rihanna 's releasing this album with a shrug really it 's brimming with musical ambition 'consideration open with rihanna wailing more full voiced than we 're used to hearing her over a light staccato beat it 's a light appetizer for what end up being a rich meal that given rihanna 's flaunted proclivity is most likely intended to be consumed slowly and meditatively after a toke fittingly the next track 'james joint open with a mission statement 'i 'd rather be smoking weed the song is all atmospherics a carefully curated sonic concoction for you to get high to and get high off then she get going 'kiss it better is a rock ballad sent from the future it 's the song on which rihanna sound most familiar that harsh voice of hers cutting through mesmerizing swirl of electronica made all the more interesting here with the usual synthesizer swapped for an electric guitar lyrically it 's the typical push and pull ruminating that defines the best rihanna song about love alternately pleading '' what are you willing to do oh tell me what you 're willing to do ' and demanding 'man fuck your pride just take it on back boy the album 's first single 'work is really the only song that could play that role a fact that is sure to disappoint those who prefer their rihanna track to torch from the speaker with dancing flame in tow featuring drake 'work is low key the groove is undeniable aided by the lyrical repetition the refrain 'work just over and over the track 's ease almost make it seem half baked a if it 's an unfinished sample waiting for production to add those sonic firework we expect but there are no firework on anti this is n't an album for the club day it 's an album for the day of netflix and chill anti is nothing if not chill 'desperado and 'woo do n't so much boom a they reverberate anti is all about atmosphere and the one that rihanna is creating is at the very least musically interesting'if sometimes even bordering on bizarre you 're almost frustrated through most of the song waiting for them to take off only to realize they 're confident and content marinating where they are 'needed me 'yeah i said it 'same ol ' mistake they 're trippy trappy mid tempo jam they 're good perhaps even great r b song they 're unexpected quite honestly from rihanna a if descendant from beyonc 's self titled album several year ago itself a body of work more interested in creating a musical experience than radio single the issue with anti though is that nothing on anti provokes or excites a much a say 'drunk in love or 'partition or 'xo which brings u to anti 's standout track 'love on the brain is a gorgeous retro masterpiece rihanna 's vocal have never been this playful this soulful this nuanced it 's dark and whimsical and stir you in the way that a song not so much performed a it is emoted felt should it might be one of rihanna 's best vocal performance and maybe even one of her best song you 're probably going to be sad that amy winehouse is n't singing it that last bit is to say that you ca n't talk about rihanna without talking about her contemporary particularly at a time when in the last few year pop 's biggest female artist have been asked to defend themselves each following up the biggest album of their career there 's katy perry whose prism signaled a performer desperate to mature to mixed result lady gaga 's artpop argued the value of artistic experimentation in favor of adherence to brand'a move that wa reviled at the moment but should merit reevaluation when it 's revisited in the retrospective of her career taylor swift went the route of reinventing herself for the radio leaning in so far into her new mission a pop diva that she nearly fell over adele opted to go the if ai n't broke route delivering an album that wa pretty much exactly the same a the one fan fell in love with it wa a rousing success you have to think that anti is a release most in line with beyonc in that here is an artist known for topping chart who would rather be known for topping critic ' list the difference m knowles already had her foot in that game m fenty did not'and her fan almost loved her more for it is it a betrayal then to release something like anti there 's nothing to dance to here nothing to shout along to nothing even really to celebrate it 's a good quiet album confusingly from one of music 's loudest performer so in that regard ha rihanna failed u maybe and that might be her coolest move yet,57087.0

series ' work is that they feature at their center charismatic men who are a amusing a they are imposing capable of extraordinary thing and also smart enough to self deprecatingly smirk at their superheroism moreover like harrison ford in the indiana jones film they 're the type of guy that woman might actually want to bed'something that could never truly be said about schwarzenegger or stallone neither of whom save for the original rocky ever shared a romantic on screen moment with a woman that did n't feel uncomfortably forced and artificial this is n't to claim that krasinski pratt chris pine star trek or the legion of fella who populate marvel 's various comic book property are in quite the same class a willis and smith though robert downey jr come closest rather it 's to argue that contemporary action cinema ha done away with it old school model of cartoonish biceps and macho attitude because it discovered that a more relatable funny self conscious as kicker is in the long run a more sustainable one schwarzenegger and stallone 's habit of slaughtering villain and then delivering post kill quip wa at the time a novel wink wink formula for success yet it soon devolved into a parody of itself peaking with 's the last action hero largely because acting like a master of the universe character afforded so few opportunity for variety that it wa destined to become monotonous on the other hand being charming and dashing with a sense of humor is an eternal recipe for movie longevity further helping funnymen 's action ascendency have been the rise of two related modern cinematic technique the first is michael bay 's pioneering use of car commercial glossy cinematography fireball heavy set piece and frantic editing'a style so often aped that it 's been given a name 'chaos cinema and now dominates the genre by employing bay 's filmmaking method an actor'any actor'can be made to look like a deadly human weapon precisely because they mask star ' physical limitation through incoherent sound and fury visuals that merely suggest 'action it 's how bay made will smith and martin lawrence martin lawrence credible super cop in bad boy it 's how he got away with casting the at that point comedy oriented nicolas cage in the rock it 's how he managed to convince studio exec to let far from intimidating ewan mcgregor command the island and it 's now how he got krasinski into hour alongside bay 's frantic aesthetic the rise of cg ha also allowed the chris pratts and chris evans of the world to seize the action throne while stallone himself blame 's batman a the turning point in the genre 's paradigm shift away from impressive physique and toward special effect that transition wa more radically prompted by 's jurassic park and again with 's spider man in which tobey maguire played the mild mannered peter parker and a team of tech wizard created on a computer his masked web slinging alter ego spider man spider man showed that human were no longer needed to even do their own stunts'a lesson subsequently reconfirmed to the tune of billion by 's iron man which required downey jr to only be a face in a cg crafted suit of armor a well a by the countless superhero saga that have followed in it wake including rom com charmer paul rudd 's recent as kicking turn a ant man in a digitized environment that barely requires an actor to

need to populate it action tentpoles with guy who spend half their life in the gym in one sense that 's a tremendous loss for the genre a flashy deceptive filmmaking becomes a substitute for flesh and

to reporter at abc news and the associated press and cnn who have all written this exact sentence headline have dubbed lentz a 'rock star pastor but the story i 'm going to write is a different story one with a more complex narrative beyond the celebrity baptism and broadway style christmas pageant it 's a story that ha even been well documented it 's a story of a church that ha struggled with a shattering pedophile scandal of a church that ha a long history of rejecting and even self admittedly damaging it gay and lesbian member a church with an ultraconservative record on gay marriage and

more prosperity gospel'though they 'd never call it that in a nutshell that 's the idea that god want you to be really rich 'if you believe in jesus brian houston told a reporter for the sydney morning herald in 'he will reward you here on earth a well a in heaven four year earlier houston had published the book you need more money god 's amazing financial plan for your life the book turned into a bit of an embarrassment it 's no longer sold and brian houston ha called it the 'silliest thing he ever did a at many church service at hillsong include a moment when an offering plate come round and parishioner are urged to heed to the old testament 's call that they tithe or turn over percent of their income to the church and the flock is listening hillsong made nearly million in total

preschooler and t shirt and conferences'it 's all tax free of course exactly where this money go including how much is given to pastor ' salary a well a how much the houston make in 'love offering for speaking engagement at other venue is somewhat opaque which make it another point of contention for hillsong critic who argue that a hillsong is essentially a family business that doe n't have to tithe to uncle sam or uncle canberra 'what good is a vow of poverty brian houston answered one naysayer in 'a person who ha more is able to help more that 's what we are all about giving people a handout three quarter of hillsong 's revenue is spent on church service and buildings'both keeping the light on for existing service and constantly expanding it reach five percent go to 'global and

can drive that car but not that car but we 're never going to cater to that mindset of people trying to tell u how to live pastor carl used to drive a black cadillac escalade when he lived in virginia

wilmore asks why young people might be turning away from religion and papa offer that the new youth of america are an informed bunch and recoil from scandal like the sexual abuse of boy in the catholic church 'you 're not wrong lentz say it wa an awkward moment for anyone who had been following the news out of australia concerning hillsong 's own record of dealing with the decade long molestation of boy by brian houston 's father frank for day in october a royal commission into institutional response to child sexual abuse in australia examined the church 's response to allegation that frank houston had sexually abused a many a nine child in the s and s brian houston later said of the abuse 'we probably will never know the exact you know how far this went or how many boy may have been involved the commission heard from one victim 'aha who testified pdf that in and when he wa a year old boy frank stayed with his family in australia aha said that after church meeting frank would 'hug and kiss me in front of other people and would 'sometimes go into an office alone where he would feel between my leg aha said frank would 'creep into my room late at night nearly every night of the week and molest him 'i would be petrified and would just lay very still aha wrote in his statement 'i could not speak while this wa happening and felt like i could not breathe i 'm not sure how long he would stay in the room with me but it felt like forever this abuse continued aha said 'for a period of year until he reached puberty at which time frank no longer had any interest in him in his testimony aha said he told his mother about the abuse in but she warned him not to challenge the houston who were according to his testimony 'almost like royalty it seems she had a change of heart two decade later though and told pastor at her local church they told higher ups and by aha 's allegation had made their way to brian 's desk brian'then the national president of the assembly of god'confronted his father and forced him to resign after hearing his confession in frank asked aha'by then a grown man'to meet him at a mcdonald 's where according to aha 's testimony and confirmed during the investigation by several others with knowledge of the meeting the former pastor offered him 'i want your forgiveness for this frank said and passed aha a dirty napkin to sign a a kind of receipt 'just do it and say you forgive me and that 'll be it frank said and promised that a check would follow shortly if there wa any problem frank told aha to contact his son brian when no money came aha testified that he phoned brian who allegedly said 'you know it 's your fault all of this happened'you tempted my father a check arrived in aha 's mailbox soon after no note wa attached brian houston confirmed that the meeting at the mcdonald 's and the payment took place but ha denied aha 's claim that he blamed the victim for his father 's abuse 'i would never say this and i do not believe this brian houston said in a statement after aha 's testimony following it investigation the royal commission released a report in november which found the following neither aha 's allegation nor those from eight other suspected victim were ever referred to police in australia a frank houston 's son brian houston had a serious conflict of interest in assuming responsibility for dealing with the allegation and the assembly of god in australia departed from their policy and procedure set out in the administration manual when it came to disciplining frank houston 'despite having knowledge that mr frank houston admitted to sexually abusing aha the national executive allowed mr frank houston to publicly resign without damage to his reputation or the reputation of hillsong church the report state frank houston drew a pension from hillsong until his death from stroke in aha told the commission 'the church community made me feel like it wa my problem i have received absolutely no support no counselling apology or acknowledgement of the abuse i believe that brian houston and other elder of the hillsong church kept the abuse a quiet a they could and have not been held accountable brian houston ha responded in multiple arena to the commission 's report when asked for comment for this article hillsong 's pr arm initially said there wa n't time to respond because of the time difference in australia the spokesperson did refer me to a statement from hillsong 's board 'we are confident that the action of pastor brian from the moment he discovered the news about his father were done with the best intention towards the victim the statement read 'it should be emphasised that pastor brian is not a perpetrator of abuse ha never been accused of abuse and took immediate action to expose and stop a child abuser brian houston ha defended his action to reporter and spoken openly in sermon and in his new book live love lead your best is yet to come about the emotional toll of finding out about frank 's abuse but one of the most concerning remark came when brian seemed to conflate homosexuality with pedophilia 'i think my father wa homosexual a closet homosexual houston told good weekend 's deborah snow in november 'i 'm no psychiatrist ' but i think whatever frustration he had he took out on child which brings u to what brian houston call 'the elephant in the room or 'the gay situation when alex pittaway 's youth pastor stood before a group of evangelical christian boy and men in sydney and shouted 'shirts off everybody listened boy a young a and their leader some a old a all ripped off shirt in a sign of godly macho solidarity someone jumped on stage and wa shouted down with jeer of 'go to the gym mate it wa n't just pastor scott 'sanga samways the nickname is slang in australia for a sausage sandwich who utilized partial nudity a a church approved bonding technique pittaway said at youth group and bible camp or any time when men and woman were separated alex remembers 'a hell of a lot of homoerotic behaviour which included encouraging boy to disrobe for alex'a closeted gay teen and member of hillsong'the command wa terrifying did the brother in christ slapping his back or complimenting his ab know he wa gay if someone knew would he think alex wa 'looking alex quit the church in after a traumatic coming out where he say he wa referred by his youth pastor to counseling that proposed to make him straight'the kind of conversion therapy we now know is based on pseudoscience a ineffectual a it is damaging for year in fact coming out to a hillsong pastor landed a church member in just such an 'ex gay ' program according to former member hillsong first helped congregant struggling with their sexuality pray their gay away in exit ministry started by frank houston or mercy ministry for lesbian the church then outsourced the conversion work to living water self shuttered in or exodus closed in or maybe an online course like setting captive free banned in the apple store in self proclaimed reformed gay and former executive director of exodus sy rogers'who now identifies a transgender and is married to a woman'wrote book and tape and would preach at hillsong conference about overcoming his gay demon he 'd tell the struggling faithful 'you got ta learn to bow down and obey and deal with it rogers ' current ministry ha moved away from the ex gay message and though rogers ha n't said so publicly brian houston told a blogger that rogers probably regret his involvement with exodus but hillsong doe n't try to 'fix ' gay congregant anymore sometime around houston distanced his church from conversion program and he now talk often about the 'weight the church bear when it come to it treatment of gay and lesbian 'they feel like 'maybe i 'm gay ' and they go to a youth leader and they are rejected brian said in a sermon 'at that moment a great hatred come in at that moment some of them have gone so far with the rejection and gone to parent who did n't understand and ended up committing suicide that 's the weight we live with it should be said here that alex currently an openly gay seminary student in indiana still think of hillsong fondly speaks of it warmly and often catch himself humming the church tune he say that while he did n't feel safe or comfortable trying to find god in a building where most of the people in it thought he wa going to hell for those who do n't define themselves by their sexuality who can compartmentalize it 's a fine place to 'worship anonymously ben fenlon a three year member of hillsong 's london satellite explained his reason for quitting the church in a piece for the huffington post he wrote 'i ca n't worship at a church knowing that i am not fully accepted and considered equal to all those around me surrounded by people that might love me a a person but do not accept me a being gay instead tolerate me people who might tell me that being gay is okay but on the inside are praying for me to let jesus move in my life and change me people who do n't recognise that any relationship that i have with a man is part of god 's plan and that it would be full of love equal to any other alex told me about a gay friend who had been booted from his position in hillsong 's child 's ministry after he came out and another who after coming out to hillsong leadership wa relieved of his duty a an usher 'he wa n't even allowed to serve cup of coffee or help direct traffic in the parking lot he said hillsong did not return request for comment on these alleged incident 'gay people need to know that when they go to hillsong they have to go to the back of the bus alex said 'hillsong is hip and attractive and contemporary but there 's certainly nothing contemporary about what lgbt people will face if they want to be a leader in the church or offer themselves up for service that 's something hillsong will have to be upfront with and they have n't been so far to be fair hillsong 's task is n't an easy one how doe an extremely conservative pentecostal church fight irrelevancy and attract those coveted millennials'a group that 's been running from church and overwhelmingly support gay marriage and equal right for lgbt people'and maintain it tithing if intolerant base at the same time hillsong ha taken certain halting step that place the church the left of it conservative counterpart some of which have labeled the aussie megachurch a unbiblical and say it leader have sold out god 's word for a younger more tolerant crowd for example hillsong leadership college recently removed homosexuality from the list of 'sexual sin ' in the student code of conduct and some member have taken pastor carl lentz 's stance'basically that homosexuality is a sin ok but no worse than any other and he get why everyone is always asking but he 'd rather not address it because jesus pretty much did n't and hillsong love everyone anyway'as a move in the right direction it 's not just conservative church that are criticizing hillsong 's stance anna flower pastor at greenpoint reformed church in brooklyn'a 'progressive young and vibrant church where she share the pulpit with two lesbian pastor and one transgender male pastor'has tweeted about what she call hillsong 's false permissiveness 'not a hip a hillsong hipster but we actually love and accept everyone she said in one tweet in another 'drives u nut when hipster evang church fool ppl into thinking they are progressive flower tell me 'there are far more truly progressive church than people realize and sometimes church look more progressive than they really are i read a many of lentz 's statement on the lgbt issue a i could find and he gave what i consider the most straightforward answer to jonathan merritt in at religion news service in august of emphasis mine 'our belief on biblical marriage and sexual morality have never changed at hillsong church yet we stay open and desperate in our pursuit of the whosoevers what that mean in practical term is that hillsong want anyone and everyone in the seat but neither support same sex marriage nor allows lgbt people to serve in position of leadership a brian houston clarified last year following the sacking of a choir director who announced his same sex engagement to another member of the choir acceptance of gay and lesbian extends only a far the the pew and for some including josh canfield and reed kelly the couple at the center of the choir controversy that 's enough for now at least ben gresham also still attends hillsong in sydney despite a complicated past with the church because he belief gay and lesbian member are key to helping the church move forward 'i try and speak to church pastor and leader when i can and have had some encouraging discussion he said gresham ha told the story of coming out at hillsong on his blog after three year of ex gay therapy constant praying even undergoing an exorcism he realized he would never be straight the thought of never being able to enter the kingdom of heaven to marry a woman to be the person hillsong told him that god wanted him to be led him to cut himself with a razor blade and one night to drive his speeding car nearly off the side of a highway he considers the last minute change of heart a miracle 'for me hillsong still feel like home it ha been a source of harm for me in the past but continues to bring me much joy and help me grow in my faith which is invaluable he said 'as a gay man and a christian i would love to see hillsong fully affirm and include it queer member i hope it happens sooner rather than later but given my experience i remain doubtful 'hillsong is a big church and so it take time to move it forward i just wish they would move a bit faster 'welcome to church is the first thing you hear when you enter hillsong a leggy blonde in leather pant warble it to me on a rainy sunday morning a i run five minute late through the rope line into hillsong midtown 's afternoon service a second woman also in leather say it again when i get to the escalator 'welcome to church a man in his s say smiling at me strangely he is not wearing leather 'welcome to church little baby he squeal to the four month old strapped to my chest three more friendly church volunteer will tell me the same before i find a seat i am able to sit in the section for people with child which is small compared to the section around it ostensibly for the millennials'the hundred of leathered plaid loving behatted young folk'seated and standing in the aisle and overflow space to hear the word of god volunteer dressed all in black pas out goldfish cracker and water in paper cup the band start to play 'aftermath a moody anthem from hillsong united 's album of the same name and a thousand hand rise into the air i feel the urge to join them because it feel strange to be in a room with that many people doing one thing while you do another but i resist by the time we get to the bridge the room is singing along with the frontman who reminds me a little of a young david crosby and everyone ha closed their eye so they ca n't see the lyric on the screen but they know every word by heart anyway they 're all singing like no one 's watching 'and iiiiii knooooow that you 're with meeeeee over and over and over again and the backup singer on stage are looking and gesticulating toward heaven and i 'm not sure whether it 's god or the swelling music or the earnestness of so many nice people in beany singing with their eye shut so tight but there 's something palpable in this room and it 's easy to see what so many people love about this place then pastor joel houston take the stage wearing a rumpled black sweatshirt and a grey beanie cocked so one ear remains out houston move into a minute sermon about giving god his due visitor should feel no pressure to give he say and black bucket are passed ceremoniously through the

pastor lentz say 'if you 're wondering what those people were doing that god hated they were basically doing what you 'd consider christian universalists these are people who were desperately trying

social medium site which wa down between am est and am est in some part of the world it wa n't back up until noon it reactivated just in time for a lengthy written conversation between two new york magazine writer annie lowrey and abe riesman about why they 're quitting twitter basically they want a respite from bully distraction and viral debate about the proper way that dog should wear pant but the very idea of quitting twitter or substantially rationing one 's involvement on the site provoked an existential word debate between the two writer they opened by acknowledging the absurdity of this debate riesman is 'fully aware of how insane this discussion must sound to any sane human being lowrey agrees ' percent and add that she ha 'rarely spent so much time contemplating my own navel that said commence the navel gazing discussion for anyone who work in medium quitting twitter is like removing yourself from the school playground where gossip and news are first leaked and everyone is competing in a popularity contest unless you 're an eminently revered novelist or an aging journalist with a well known byline quitting twitter will make you le visible to your writing audience a well a to other editor and writer you 'll be le clued in to breaking news hot take and the endless stream of joke and observation from politico during presidential debate if this is your bread and butter quitting twitter will make you anxious and emotionally ravaged by fomo 'fear of missing out so much so that you wo n't actually 'quit indeed neither lowrey nor riesman ha signed off the network instead they 've cut back in their own way on monday morning lowrey 's tweeted a link to her conversation with riesman goodbye forever twitter riesman ha been absent from the twitterverse for four day when he promoted his most recent story his feed is currently filled with link to his piece though lowrey wa tweeting during recent debate and last week 's state of the union twitter ha 'mostly been a megaphone for me not a chat room and much le of a megaphone than it used to be at that if you 're like lowrey who ha follower you 'll likely be criticized by many who disagree with your character opinion or a story you wrote and linked to in a tweet and because this is all happening on the internet there will be a good number of asshats among those follower who will criticize you for something entirely unrelated to your work or your politics after a certain point this wa too much for lowrey a an 'official woman on the internet lowrey had suffered year of 'mansplaining from well intentioned friend the forest for the tree criticism of my grammar the constant degrading reference to me a my husband 's wife lowrey is married to ezra klein also a journalist who ha more than a million twitter follower her breaking point came when a story she wrote about poverty wa met with 'a flood of nasty sexist tweet and emails'just day and day of it it wa impossible to defend myself and impossible to work and impossible to focus and i just wanted to leave the internet forever most of u have wanted to leave the internet forever at some point in time enraged by idiotic comment in our facebook feed following a major news event or driven to distraction by the whir of everyone weighing in on twitter but we also know that we live in an internet age and unless we want to become ice fisherman in alaska leaving the internet forever is a pipe dream and most writer accept that exposing themselves and their work come with the risk of being relentlessly criticized riesman ha significantly fewer twitter follower than lowrey around but his reason for limiting his activity are similar being on the receiving end of a deluge of insult after he tweeted something about star war and investing too much time and emotional energy in petty online argument he doe n't engage with anyone on twitter anymore but acknowledges that 'there are still some quasi essential purpose that it serf for my professional life the fact that lowrey and riesman felt compelled have this conversation demonstrates how myopic the medium world ha become indeed twitter is an insular echo chamber for people who do n't follow or engage others with different opinion they may be taking a break from their twitter feed but by announcing their departure they 're signaling to their follower this is an experiment'do n't give up on me twitter is part of their job if two equally qualified writer are vying for the same role the one with more twitter follower will get it being 'good at twitter'being quick witted in character and skilled at multitasking'is a valuable weapon in the modern writer 's armory even if it doe n't necessarily reflect one 's talent a a crafter of word one daily beast colleague a tremendously gifted and experienced writer who only recently joined twitter compare it to standing in the middle of time square and shouting your opinion or your breaking news scoop to million of passersby hoping someone will listen it 's a lot of effort for what he view to be a largely thankless and futile exercise yet he 's on there for a reason,5950.0

star trek reference and concluded'naturally'by flashing the vulcan 'live long and prosper sign day later shatner wa incredulous to hear that his message had been quoted during an official government session when he rang the daily beast to talk trek 'did they read it out loud i ca n't believe it he laughed 'they read it out loud 'it wa tongue in cheek more than anything else he said highly amused 'well it 's not a terrible message that 's remarkable and i 'm complimented'i think should shatner 's prime directive directive help make scotland the site of the uk 's first commercial spaceport however the erstwhile james tiberius kirk will pas on voyage departing from earth thank you very much 'going up into space and coming back down no he declared 'there 's no guarantee i 'm coming back

concert tour which brings music from the film and television show together performed by a live orchestra and accompanied by iconic clip from five decade of trek 'it 's taking the theme and relating them to other star trek franchise he explained 'man against man might come up three or four time in different entity the music is really sensational you 'd think he 'd be tired of hearing the same majestic score fifty year in but shatner chuckled at the thought fifty year on into the influential series'which see it th film hit theater this summer albeit sans shatner'trek ha had such a lasting impact on pop culture that this year apple released an llap emoji weaving spock 's famous gesture into the very fabric of our digital life 'it 's a long time and yet it 's no time at all said shatner 'and that 's the tragedy and the excitement of it i 'm amazed at how much influence this small show had on people 's life their choice of career getting over grief major event in their life star trek seems to have helped i ask shatner if he ever ha work dream from his year in that starfleet uniform on the set of the seminal star trek the original series and the seven feature film that followed 'no i do n't have those dream he laugh 'well i 'll tell you one of my recurring dream i ride a lot of horse and i 'm competitive in riding and one of my dream is i 'm on my horse and the horse is galloping across a field i 'm running the horse is running and it 's running for me i 'm running a fast a the horse 'if you 're seeking to analyze the dream it could go anywhere but i am on the horse

him busy these day including the u s debut of his one man show shatner 's world'we just live in it which began by request in australia before shatner took it to canada and broadway he 's also releasing his latest book leonard my fifty year friendship with a remarkable man about his star trek co star and longtime pal leonard nimoy who passed away last february from lung disease the memoir wa inspired by the rare closeness he shared with nimoy shatner said 'i never had that kind of thing before and having achieved it wa remarkable to me he said 'his death wa a severe loss in my life when you lose somebody you love with whom you 've had life experience all of those life experience are not validated anymore 'remember when we did this ' there 's nobody left to say that to so that memory is lost a part of your life go it also delf into shatner 's musing on friendship itself particularly among men 'the strangeness of friendship why men have more difficulty making friend than woman do how to make a friend what a friend mean and how you sustain a friendship he explained shatner 's bond with nimoy wa born five decade ago but captain kirk wa n't buddy buddy with all of his enterprise mate his public feud with co star george takei it seems ha not been squashed since exploding over a decade ago in the page of takei 's autobiography to the star in which he claimed shatner snubbed him on the tos set 'he is very self centered takei said of shatner last year on real time with bill maher shatner shot back calling takei 'a disturbed individual shatner say they have n't yet buried the hatchet 'he buried the hatchet he laughed 'in my back no i do n't know him i have n't seen him in or year he 's a strange man and i do n't know who he is surely he did once upon a time when the actor shared time on the bridge of the enterprise 'i never really knew him to begin with you know he 'd come in for a day then leave i did n't know who he wa exactly 'the reality in filming a movie or a series is that it 's broken down into scene and people can play a scene and then leave so if george wa in a scene'which he wa on occasion'he 'd do a scene and then leave so i did n't know him very well he just seems to have had a bug somewhere and ha held onto it for year which seems on it face remarkable earlier in the day word broke of actor alan rickman 's passing 'i did n't know him but i wa an admirer of his said shatner of rickman whose lauded career included the star trek send up galaxy quest in which he played a droll nimoy figure 'a wonderful and eloquent actor obviously classically trained he wa a joy to behold another recent loss sent shatner down memory lane his concept album seeking major tom wa inspired by the iconic work of david bowie whose january passing shocked fan across the world underscoring his musical and cinematic impact 'i had the best time with that shatner fondly recalled 'when i saw bowie perform it it wa a lesson in uniqueness and individuality and blind talent for me i used the song a a device to string cover song all the way through trying to find what happened to major tom'he step out of a capsule and we never hear of him again i tried to find where he might have gone walking on the moon a for further bowie cover shatner 's 'been there done that but he doe have a christmas album in the work 'i ca n't tell you what it is but i do have a concept he teased 'christmas song evoke a beautiful sense of peace and justice and little chubby fat men on the roof star trek 's golden anniversary year also coincides with the u s presidential race but the prolific twitterer declined to comment on the upcoming election 'i 'm not going to get involved in the trump debate he declared deftly deflecting maybe he got enough grief last summer when republican presidential candidate ted cruz claimed captain kirk a his kind of leader 'i think it is quite likely that kirk is a republican and picard is a democrat cruz theorized sparking heated debate among fan and a tweet reply from shatner himself 'star trek wa n't political i 'm not political i ca n't even vote in the u s tweeted shatner who is canadian born but became a naturalized u s citizen in 'so to put a geocentric label on interstellar character is silly knowing now that even the british parliament ha his ear however he offered the same piece of advice to the u s government and 's american presidential hopeful do n't mess with the prime directive ' to u s politician i say the same thing do n't interfere with our personal life proclaimed the only man to beat

double the type of discrimination a their gay and lesbian peer two study published in the december issue of the journal of bisexuality confirm what bi people have been saying for some time the discrimination they face within the lgbt community is a real a the discrimination they face outside of it a the u s enters it first full year of marriage equality and the battle for transgender right continues these study point to the persistent but often ignored problem of biphobia among gay men and lesbian in one study counseling psychology phd student tangela robert and two professor at the university of massachusetts surveyed bisexual people about their experience of discrimination in various social context they found that the biphobia their respondent experienced from gay men and lesbian wa not equal to but still disturbingly comparable to what they experienced from straight people 'although the level of discrimination that bisexual experienced from heterosexual when compared to discrimination from the lesbian and gay community wa statistically significantly higher the effect size reveals that the degree of difference wa small their study concluded 'essentially it 's like saying that two people are yelling at you but one voice is a decibel higher robert explained to the daily beast 'yes statistically one voice is more significant but the difference between the two voice is small the survey for the study asked bisexual people to complete an anti bisexual experience scale abes which asked on a scale from to how frequently certain event have happened to them such a being told that they were 'confused about their orientation being 'excluded from social network or having it be assumed that they are more likely to cheat because they are bisexual a the study sadly indicated these attitude are common not just among straight people but among gay men and lesbian a well the average abes score reported for experience with straight people wa the average for experience among gay men and lesbian wa only slightly lower at robert belief that her research shed light on a troubling but often ignored fault line within the lgbt population 'this is the thing that is n't talked about she said 'it 's like airing out the dirty laundry of the supposed 'lgbt community ' it 's saying 'look we have n't been acting like this community that we 're supposed to be and we need to do something about that ' at the centre for addiction and mental health in toronto postdoctoral research fellow corey flanders and her co author came to a similar conclusion several of the young bisexual woman they interviewed about mental health for their study in the journal of bisexuality described feeling excluded within lgbt space ' a couple of year ago i went to pride and i took my boyfriend with me because he just wanted to be supportive and come with me to this thing that 's really important to me one interviewee said ' we did a march and at the end of it i wa feeling really happy and excited and we kissed and people started booing u ' t hat wa really hurtful for me she added 'because it wa like being rejected by my own community based on these wrong assumption they were making about me flanders told the daily beast that biphobia among gay men and lesbian 'certainly come up frequently among participant in discussion of bisexual mental health 'with gay and lesbian individual social support can be accessed in queer community space if not in predominantly heterosexual space she said 'with bisexual individual this is not always the case left with few place to find unqualified support it may not be surprising that bisexual people have some of the worst mental health outcome of any sexual orientation a large study in the american journal of public health found that bisexual men and woman had a higher prevalence of mood and anxiety disorder a compared to gay men lesbian and heterosexual one example nearly percent of bisexual woman had a lifetime history of mood disorder compared to about percent of lesbian and a little over percent of heterosexual woman 'pervasive stereotype and negative attitude about bisexuality are present not only among the 'dominant ' heterosexual population but among lesbian and gay population a well resulting in a 'double stigma ' for bisexual the author wrote in an attempt to account for the alarmingly high rate of depression and anxiety among bisexual robert flanders and other lgbt scholar have begun to label this 'double stigma a 'monosexism a specific form of prejudice against those who are attracted to more than one gender a used in their research the term function a a catch all for both the heterosexual stigmatization of bisexuality and the questioning of bi identity among member of other sexual minority 'it 's essentially thinking that the only 'true ' sexual orientation are heterosexual lesbian and or gay robert told the daily beast 'all other sexual orientation are deemed to be illegitimate not real or just a product of confusion robert who openly identifies a bisexual herself say that she ha always known from her own experience that monosexism wa a problem among gay men and lesbian but that it wa 'heartbreaking to see her personal knowledge verified empirically 'while doing this study i had one of those moment where i wa sitting there interpreting the data and once i realized what the number were telling me i felt this immense sadness for the participant for myself and for this concept of a 'lgbt community ' that we 've told ourselves is functioning and supportive she said the one silver lining of robert ' study wa that bisexual people who felt accepted by friend and family reported lower abes score than those who lacked a support network but this finding may be cold comfort to a sexual minority that remains largely closeted long after many gay men and lesbian in the u s have already come out according to estimate from the williams institute at ucla bisexual people are more numerous than gay men and lesbian combined but according to a pew survey they are the most likely to be in the closet with just percent reporting that 'all or most of the important people in their life know about their orientation that same pew survey found that bisexual people were the sexual minority least likely to believe that lgbt people are socially accepted with percent saying that there wa 'only a little or no acceptance of lgbt people those number may not budge for bisexual until coming out is a le risky course of action robert ' study found that despite the subset of people who had supportive friend and family 'participants who were out to family and friend reported greater antibisexual discrimination ' t he fact that outness to family and friend wa negatively related to antibisexual discrimination is concerning suggesting that bisexual people who are out may be vulnerable to discrimination in many context the study noted several of flanders ' interviewee also relayed that coming out wa a the researcher summarized 'an exhausting process due to the widespread misunderstanding of bisexuality they encountered from their friend one participant said that when she came out to a straight male love interest he replied 'oh you 're a lesbian after she tried to explain he said 'uh i just think of you a a lesbian in my head it 's easier for me crucially it 's not just straight people who can make coming out an ordeal for bisexual people last february when kate brown became the first openly bisexual governor an old essay of hers resurfaced in which she recalled being called 'half queer by her gay friend after revealing her orientation like brown many bisexual people are disheartened to find their identity interrogated by people who are ostensibly part of the same community there is a b after all in lgbt a bi activist anna aagenes recalled in a blog post 'finding the lgbt community wa like joining a new club that i technically belonged to but when i arrived to pick up my towel and complimentary gym pas my membership wa called into question and if it wa n't clear before the latest issue of the journal of bisexuality it 's becoming harder to deny now biphobia within the lgbt community is not a minor internal conflict but a significant form of prejudice that is almost certainly having a negative effect on bisexual people 's mental health 'this form of exclusion may account for some of the elevated negative mental health outcome among bisexual people because they are not only experiencing discrimination from heterosexual people but from gay and lesbian people a well flanders told the daily beast what can be done to counteract these negative effect robert think it 's time to finally air the dirty laundry of monosexism and confront the stigma that prevents bisexual people from feeling like the b in lgbt is more than just a gesture 'realistically there are change that need to happen bias that we need to talk about and long held discriminatory belief that need to be addressed she said 'this must happen before we can really get to a point where we can say that these community are for all non

being left alone for so long even with the best of boy they 'started out on the freshman in the downstairs basement a source close to the victim said 'all of the freshman got the pool cue that included the boy who would later have 'holes in his pant and need surgery for the sodomy according to the source the bully are upperclassmen who apparently hazed all of the freshman during their out of town stay later on that night they headed upstairs where the year old victim wa sound asleep and allegedly ambushed him the freshman fought back against the licking which only served to make their blow even more vicious this wa too much for the boy who told coach montgomery that he wa being harassed montgomery according to multiple account marched over to the cabin and chewed out the entire

teamed the boy were charged with one count of aggravated rape and one count of aggravated assault the sevier county prosecutor could upgrade the charge to four count of aggravated rape for each boy and hit all three with multiple count of aggravated assault it wa highly likely that other teammate were unaware of what wa happening since the source close to the victim said 'there wa a lot of screaming going on and a source close to the investigation told the daily beast the boy 'may have changed role by taking turn tackling the teen into submission before wielding the cue stick and plunging it into the boy 'through his clothing the boy who captured the assault on snapchat wa wa interviewed by investigator this week but 'refused to say what his role wa or if there wa a video recording the teen still could face criminal charge for his chronicling role in the gang rape even despite the fact that his parent initially came clean about his involvement eerily the alleged senior ringleader had posted on facebook when he wa a freshman athlete four year ago some rule to avoid getting pranked 'rule never be the first man asleep when you with a group of people splashdown 'rule do n't prank everybody else around you and go to sleep that'stragic after his name leaked online a one of the accused his facebook account got trolled 'you 're a sick person what you did wa fucking horrible wrote one person 'you 'll get all the as reaming you can stand where you 're headed big boy wrote another hazing is said to routinely occur in the ooltewah locker room where the light are shut off and in the dark and younger team member are repeatedly walloped by their upperclassmen teammate 'the player cut the light out so they could n't see who it wa that punched them and there wa wrestling and horseplaying going on according to a source close to the victim coach montgomery would be next door to the locker room and would put the kibosh on the asskicking 'the coach would hear the racket and told them 'stop horsing around before somebody get hurt ' the source said coach montgomery 's attorney denied his client presided over such brutality 'there is no culture of hazing or abuse at ooltewah where athlete are encouraged or taught to violate the law or even simply human decency by teacher administrator or coach curtis l bowe iii said in a statement last week the source close to the victim acknowledged that while the attack wa ferocious the boy had mentioned that it wa n't the first time he 'd been hazed given that the practice is ingrained in ooltewah high 's culture 'they pick on the freshman student but you never heard of stuff going this far in term of hazing the source said 'these kid did something that is heinous and evil to me and how can you even fathom this kind of stuff if the rape wa n't startling enough then the school 's sidestepping should be principal jim jarvis made little of the gang rape in an email two day later 'a violation of team policy did occur he wrote followed by athletic director jesse nayadley who said there wa 'no reason to look into the coach after the attack source close to the investigation say nayadley will be charged with false reporting after he downplayed the diabolical incident to investigator it wa n't until last wednesday more than two week after the rape that the hamilton county board of education and high school administration canceled the varsity basketball season superintendent rick smith publicly announced he wa going to forfeit the remaining game of the owl ' varsity season to douse the basketball bonfire 'since this speculation is likely to continue until the investigation is concluded and since this speculation could threaten the integrity of law enforcement 's investigation i have decided to end the team 's season he read allowed in a prepared statement smith offered up 'how heartbroken i am about this and that he wa going to 'develop the kind of safeguard that will prevent this from ever happening again for the source who 's close to the victim the nonchalance by coach montgomery and the school seemed calculated 'the school board member they did n't bother to come off from their little vacation and meet on this thing earlier the source who requested anonymity said 'that 's two week we 're talking about that they had the opportunity to get a hand on it and they 're waiting till wednesday the lip service seemed to have temporarily stalled the outrage since the team went on to play three game before the administration finally buckled to pressure meanwhile coach 'tank montgomery ha since been banished from setting foot on any hamilton county school campus and relegated to sorting textbook and teaching material at a local book depository after administrator scuttled the rest of the team 's game the daily beast ha learned 'it 's not a supervisor position the source close to the investigation said the source added that coach montgomery and williams will be charged with failure to report the rape to authority and charged with child neglect for leaving player alone in a cabin for two hour on jan the charged defendant must appear in sevier county juvenile court room on jan the senior a source close to the rape case noted will turn five day later that mean he will be tried a an adult if the case is n't resolved by his birthday on jan 'and if he 's found guilty and incarcerated the source said 'he 'll be moved to big boy jail but the source added that the prosecutor 'is not inclined to transfer the case to adult court the hamilton county school district referred the daily beast to lawyer d scott bennett who declined to answer any question 'we are limited by instruction from law enforcement not to comment out of concern that doing so might compromise an ongoing investigation he wrote hamilton county prosecutor have opened a probe back in ooltewah tennessee to determine if a history of assault extends beyond this rape incident once accusation came out claiming there may have been more than one hazing incident during the tournament trip to gatlinburg district attorney neal pinkston 's office said it would dive in 'when they said the hazing happened on the trip we did n't know if that meant getting in the van in hamilton county or arriving in sevier county most troubling it seems is the collateral damage for anybody associated with the ooltewah varsity squad while their season of more game wa over the freshman team schedule wa n't affected but according to a source close to the investigation one of the freshman player who traveled to the tournament and had been a victim of the hazing showed up to play in friday 's freshman matchup but wa turned away and told to hang up hitops for rest of the season because of his 'association with the varsity team which ha been sanctioned yet week before the alleged rape a tennessee watchdog organization called unifi ed had completed a bullying study and when reaching out to student throughout the state they found that bullying topped the list of kid ' concern on monday the nonprofit executive director elizabeth crew sent a letter to the hamilton county school district 's chairman and the superintendent detailing at least five blaring way that the district wa 'not in compliance with state anti bullying guideline first ooltewah and other school in the district have failed to give kid discrete way to report when they 've bullied 'having a safe anonymous way to report is huge crew said 'their system ha none of that crew is also stunned the district remains tone deaf when it come to consequence once retaliation is inflicted after bullying allegation get reported 'i have n't seen where it 's written down anywhere in policy procedure or in the student handbook

turn out is n't just bad for our culture societal progress and the art it 's also bad for business having a compelling effect on the rating for oscar telecast through the year the daily beast ha learned the inexcusable'and yes blinding'whiteness of this year 's academy award ha sent ripple effect through hollywood with many member of the community outraged that for the second year in a row not a single acting nominee is a person of color not only that but not a single film telling the story of a person of color is nominated for best picture the oscarssowhite hashtag started when marked the first oscar in two decade without a single acting nominee of color wa revived in response kindling fiery passion throughout the industry'from people of color or otherwise several of hollywood 's most famous black actor have called for a boycott of the ceremony the academy ha announced an initiative to ensure more diversity in it voting body and revamped it voting eligibility rule in response to suggestion that the lack of diversity in the nominee stem from the overwhelming makeup of it voter male white and old nearly every single actor in hollywood ha at this point been asked to weigh in on the issue and speculation ha run rampant on how oscar host chris rock'one of the sharpest comedian when it come to race observation and an actor who ha penned an essay in the past about institutional racism'would address the controversy during this year 's ceremony and because hollywood is a business and the academy award is after all a television show too there ha been handwringing over how oscarssowhite would affect this year 's oscar ratings'one year after the telecast offered up the worst viewership number since while the deafening oscarssowhite controversy may actually spark interest in this year 's telecast a look at past viewership data suggests that a lack of diversity in nominee ha a noticeably negative effect on oscar rating using rating data provided by nielsen that broke oscar viewership down by race stretching back to the telecast we found that the largest percentage of black viewer and non white viewer tuned in to the academy award in year when the most nominee of color and film featuring protagonist of color were in contention the reverse is also true generally the year with the least diversity were the least watched among people of color not only that but the year that had the highest percentage of black and non white viewer also happened to be the highest rated oscar telecast overall that mean that people of color have been a major force in driving the biggest oscar rating simply put a more diverse slate of nominee lead to better rating assuming that the academy need big rating number to make money and stay relevant oscarssowhite'or at the very least a resistance to diversity'is bad for business for example wa the year with the highest rating among black viewer with million tuning in amounting to percent of that year 's total viewer it wa also among the highest rated oscar ceremony in the year that we surveyed topping out at million viewer that year six nominee were actor of color don cheadle and sophie okonedo hotel rwanda morgan freeman million dollar baby catalina sandino moreno maria full of grace and jamie foxx who won for ray and wa nominated for collateral plus ray wa a best picture nominee one of only nine best picture nominee in the year we surveyed featuring a protagonist of color the others crash babel precious the help django unchained year a slave and selma and we will concede that several of the film on that list are dubious inclusion over the course of the year we looked into viewership among black and non white viewer which includes hispanic and asian viewer reliably spiked in year with the most nominee of color in there were a remarkable eight nominee of various non white race contending for acting trophy forest whitaker last king of scotland will smith the pursuit of happyness penelope cruz volver djimon hounsou blood diamond eddie murphy and jennifer hudson dreamgirls and adriana barraza and rinko kinkuchi babel that year percent of the total viewership wa black the second highest in that period just more than percent of the viewership wa non white a a whole'the highest of any year and it wa the year with the second biggest rating overall with million viewer tuning in signaling again that people of color help to drive viewership in the biggest oscar year babel wa also a best picture nominee that year though it did n't get a best picture nod dreamgirls wa the most nominated film of the year beyonc and jennifer hudson were among the performer at the ceremony and hudson and forest whitaker were presumed victor long before the ceremony aired there 's no factual correlation between an oscar telecast that spotlight black performer and higher rating but there certainly is an anecdotal case to be made suggesting that and while the number indicate that total viewership surge when black viewership surge ' 's telecast in which precious wa nominated scored a stellar million viewer and wa third ranked among black viewer and nominee of color'there is also a correlation between a lack of diversity and rating up until last year 's first oscarssowhite telecast during which selma wa nominated for best picture the least watched oscar telecast among black and non white viewer were perhaps expectedly the year featuring only two nominee of color or le and no best picture nominee featuring diverse protagonist the lowest percentage of black viewer tuned in for the and telecast in only djimon hounsou in america and ken watanabe the last samurai were nominated in only javier bardem no country for old men and ruby dee american gangster got nod in it wa only bardem for biutiful and with the exception of 's ceremony which aired during an era when the oscar rating did n't fluctuate a wildly a they tend to now and were almost always guaranteed blockbuster number total viewership over the year we surveyed wa reliably lowest when the film in contention were woefully well 'white the rating for last year 's oscarssowhite fiasco were the worst since a fact that you ca n't help contrast with the number for the year before the ceremony in 'when year a slave won best picture lupita nyong'o won best supporting actress and chiwetel ejiofor and barkhad abdi were also nominees'was the highest rated ceremony of the year we surveyed oh and the lowest rating that wa for 's ceremony a year that wa almost laughably white no country for old men defeated there will be blood juno atonement and michael clayton for best picture admittedly this is n't a perfect argument there are many reason why rating for the oscar surge or plummet a theory that is often floated correlate high rating to the box office total of the nominee the year of titanic remains the most watched oscar ever in our surveyed range lord of the ring return of the king help stoke big rating in while the year that avatar competed but lost also put up big number still there is a compelling case to be made by looking at the data that diversity in nominee and the film in contention also play a major part in driving viewership it should also be noted that the year avatar competed wa also one of the most diverse year in term of nominee plus year featuring the largest percentage of black and non white voter also had the highest oscar rating suggesting that people of color play a large part in fueling bigger viewership number and that happens when there are diverse nominee so what doe all of this mean for this year a year when the lack of diversity among the nominee is n't just fodder for thinkpieces and social medium handwringing'but actual call for action this is an unprecedented situation'two consecutive year with no acting nominee of color and this year no best picture nominee either'and therefore an unprecedented case study despite our argument that a lack of diversity hurt oscar rating there 's a valid rebuttal that the zeitgeist seizing controversy surrounding oscarssowhite could actually lead to bigger number a lot of people are desperate to know how the academy and especially chris rock will address the situation if at all and what repercussion there will be from the grassroots oscar boycott'again if any in a year when a huge swath of best picture nominee generate little excitement and suffer from low box office total let alone awareness'how many people in peoria have seen room it 's lovely i 'm just making a point'the scandal is piquing interest in the telecast and at the very least reminding people that it 's even on but that brings up a larger point one that tie this diversity viewership theory to the box office viewership one people care about the academy award telecast when it feature movie and performance they 've seen what these stats and the oscarssowhite debate in general make clear is that people who go to the movies'people of every color every race every gender every sexual orientation'really just want to see themselves it 's time to make that happen,9065.0

finished a documentary film on dishonesty three year in the making and his scandal had u reeling in one section of our film williams appears a a voice of authority explaining the downfall of an

of'yes gulp'mein kampf adolf hitler 's autobiographical manifesto wa re released in a new highly annotated academic edition in german with footnote and nearly page in two volume the new book is more than twice a long a hitler 's page original withheld from publication for seven decade for fear that it might stir up neo nazi or tarnish germany 's international image hitler 's convoluted anti semitic memoir is back in print in the land of it origin because it copyright ha just run out since january one of the world 's most notorious book ha been in the public domain and while the reissue of hitler 's anti semitic rant is denounced by some especially within the jewish holocaust survivor community it is being greeted enthusiastically by the great majority of scholar including jewish intellectual in the u s israel and germany even the head of the central council of jew in germany josef schuster ha welcomed the issuance of the annotated book by munich 's respected institute for contemporary history 'there are no objection to a scientifically annotated edition he said that is a it should be it 's time for the long taboo book to face the harsh light of common scrutiny by a german public that is three generation removed from the war and it is high time even long overdue that german schoolchildren and university student have the benefit of direct access to the early raw material of hitler 's madness just a they have long been able to read his speech and see him perform in old film clip though young reader could also find mein kampf on the internet or perhaps in their grandparent ' attic the book ha for seven decade lived a shadow existence a a contraband item that wa too hot to touch the book or even significant excerpt from it have never been part of the german school curriculum'even though postwar germany 's first president theodor heuss recommended just such a step in now say germany 's education minister johanna wanka mein kampf can be taught in the school because 'hitler 's statement will no longer be uncontradicted fear that hitler 's feverish but rambling and repetitive writing would somehow incite a neo nazi revival are dismissed by most observer the pure text ha for year been posted on extremist right wing website in german and other language and ha not yet triggered a fascist groundswell such german xenophobia a exists today is more likely to be directed at syrian refugee than channeled through hitler 's obsession with jew for contemporary reader of any political persuasion digging into hitler 's overheated simplistic theory of racial domination and his tangled ' s foreign policy prescription is more in the nature of historical homework than political inspiration but the homework is important and that 's what make the arrival of the new 'critical edition of mein kampf a positive step closeting the single most important original source of the nazi enterprise is hardly the way to educate and inoculate future german generation about their country 's darkest hour putting the academic imprimatur on the beast somehow tames it converting it from inflammatory political pamphlet to interesting historical artifact now it can be taught for what it is and teaching is the key hitler 's original aggressively marketed by his munich publisher sold more than million copy but the munich scholar openly hoped their book priced at a set would not become a bestseller'the new edition ha an initial print run of only it is designed for library researcher and teacher 'the book will get a multiplier effect through academic use and the medium comment historian christian hartmann the scholar in charge of the project with the footnote snaking throughout the text the new mein kampf more closely resembles a theological treatise than a political tract 'ironically the newly annotated 'mein kampf ' will look like the talmud noted dan michman head of international research at yad vashem museum in israel the talmudic analogy flow from the decision by the mein kampf academic team to 'encircle hitler 's word with the analytical and deconstructing footnote 'we wanted to surround the text to demystify it and destroy it say hartmann since his team of five scholars'with help from several dozen others'has traced and dissected the origin of hitler 's complex sometimes outrageous thinking almost sentence by sentence since hitler wrote only in the omniscient voice and almost never attributed idea to anyone and provided no footnote at all the task ha been monumental hitler 's text needed deconstructing not simply because it is offensive and inflammatory it is also dense convoluted and filled with obscure reference writing the first volume of his book in in a small prison cell outside munich'where he wa serving time for the abortive beer hall putsch'hitler wallowed in the common 'truths half truth and lie of social darwinism of the late th century and early th century say hartmann when i visited that cell in the internal wall are gone but the window where hitler stood for an iconic photograph are exactly the same i could visualize the 'small library hitler had along one wall where he drew on the random writing of the day for his racist idea hitler pasted together strewn data and tendentious notion for his own purpose with no documentation or even the slightest attempt to persuade reader of their veracity where he discovered his oversimplified constructs'about 'the path of the jew for example'and why he dwelt at length on such topic a 'the art of reading and on stamping out syphilis 'the task of the nation are all subject of the scholarly inquiry and the commentary but the decision to publish the book wa not entirely academic anticipating the expiration of the book 's copyright'held since by the state of bavaria which refused republication on political grounds'the historian and other civil society actor including jewish and catholic group sought to steal a march on potential exploiter of the copyright free book by commissioning the academic version'and having it ready by the crack of they feared that allowing mein kampf to be issued by a neo nazi group or a commercial publisher seeking a quick buck sensation would have once again tarred germany 's image better to do the deed at the highest and most sober level reasoned the researcher there have been numerous enquiry by foreign publisher though no translation ha yet begun while the lifting of one of the last postwar prohibition in germany ha to be seen a a sign of civic maturity german are still to some extent afraid of their own shadow the conference of state justice minister who enforce law like incitement to hatred have said they will prosecute anyone who publishes a non annotated version of mein kampf even today the naked text is treated like the unexploded ordinance of german history perhaps after a generation of german ha digested the newly deconstructed version the pure hitler will not seem so scary demystified mein kampf can be turned into what it ultimately is'the last relic of a failed and horrific enterprise peter ross range a washington based writer is the author of the year that made hitler

31,9558506.0,2016-01-02T05:01:00+00:00,what will america stand for in,'what doe america stand for is a question with many answer to many people around the world even more than 'what should america stand for the crisis today is n't which answer is the best or even which question is most relevant but the fact that neither question is being asked much at all in america itself even during this heated presidential primary election season is n't simply a choice between pushing the swinging pendulum of american politics back again or continuing with the status quo nor is it a choice between extremist and centrist or 'primary extremist who will magically transform into centrist even before the last convention balloon ha popped both the republican and the democrat have had their dalliance with relatively extreme ideological nominee in the past they have not fared well in the general election barry goldwater may have laid the ground for the reagan revolution in but he wa battered by lyndon johnson george mcgovern might not have looked so bad in hindsight after richard nixon met his watergate but that doe n't change the fact that he made nixon look like napoleon in the landslide next year 's election could look similar if donald trump or ted cruz come out of the gop primary to gift wrap the election for hillary clinton the tea party remnant evangelicals and other group who appear to hold so much sway in the republican primary are not a big enough base for a candidate who ha offended nearly every other group in america or could enter uncharted territory if bernie sander stick around long enough to pull hillary even further to the left she 's no ideologue but the more the democrat follow sander down the socialist path the more we have to wonder what it will be like to have a goldwater versus a mcgovern election with no sane center in sight what happens when the gop is nationalist the dems are socialist and trump is national socialist i 'm sure i 'm not alone in not wanting to find out this risk is even greater in foreign policy clinton ha essentially endorsed president obama 's play acting policy a befits his former secretary of state the obama white house see the islamic state a a communication problem that would go away if only the american people would agree that the white house is doing a great job'despite of american saying the battle against terror is not going well meanwhile obama and john kerry continue to insist that vladimir putin can be an ally an idea that wa na ve seven year ago foolish four year ago and ca n't be called anything le than insane or suicidal at this point with security now the top issue for most american it 's awkward for hillary to denounce the do nothing obama policy that ha led this to be the case since she wa one of it architect coming to rescue clinton from this dilemma is a new breed of gop neo america first nationalist isolationist whose tenet seem to be that america is god 's chosen nation and the rest of the world can go to hell this is dubious theology at best and the fact that america wo n't be in good shape for long if the rest of the world is in flame should be obvious the cruz trump line that the united state can prosper while hiding between two ocean and occasionally carpet bombing a far off land is preposterous a well a morally repugnant the america firsters who wanted to keep america out of world war ii had a first principle that said 'no foreign power nor group of power can successfully attack a prepared america that wa quickly refuted by pearl harbor immediately after which the america first committee disbanded and ha been disproved even more emphatically by the attack and the spate of foreign and homegrown terror attack in recent month playing defense ha n't worked since and thanks largely to technology attack are only getting easier the isolationist also ignore the fact that globalized economy have global interest and that stability is essential for global trade unless the u s is prepared to roll back the countless benefit it company and citizen reap from cheap energy and global market for american product and service walking away a the chaos grows is self destructive in the extreme to be fair donald trump is n't exactly isolationist in the way cruz and rand paul are if it 's possible to glean anything from trump 's incoherent statement on foreign affair it 's that he favor bombing terrorist while partnering with those who sponsor and protect those same terrorist if this sound like just another outrageous trump position this is the policy of the supposedly supremely rational barack obama who ha made deal with cuba and iran held peace talk with putin and walked away from his syrian red line which ha since been painted many time over in blood by bashar assad obama 's sporadic military intervention with no long term strategic basis are intended to improve poll number not national security saying the u s care but only enough to drop a few billion dollar ' worth of explosives'often hitting civilian and infrastructure'makes thing worse telling the world to go to hell is bad enough doing so while fanning the flame even hotter is sickening a foreign policy choice between more clinton obama lip service and trump cruz nationalism is terrifying after two two term president with diametrically opposed ideology on foreign policy and domestic affair america is facing an existential challenge is it to be just another country one more nation state that just happens to be much richer and stronger than any other or is there still a case and a cause for american exceptionalism that say that the only nation founded on the idea of freedom ha the obligation to use it immense wealth and power to promote that freedom elsewhere my personal answer is n't much of a surprise since it 's one that i share with nearly everyone who ha lived in an unfree state or who ha had their freedom mortally threatened i grew up in the soviet union in a mixed family'and i do n't mean my armenian jewish heritage my baku relative included die hard communist who would excuse nearly every catastrophe and shortage a the fault of flawed individual not the state or the system they lived in a fragile truce with my father and his brother and cousin natural skeptic who wanted me to grow up without illusion for an inquisitive child who wa included early on in family argument there were clear flaw in the delightful theory that everything should be shared 'from each according to his ability to each according to his need i had been exposed to a real meritocracy early in life at the chessboard and the idea that it wa wrong to enjoy the fruit of success seemed ridiculous why work hard if my hard work produced no benefit for me and my family and if socialism wa so wonderful why did it have to be imposed by force why could the great and generous state only be criticized in whisper of course the soviet authority were well aware of these contradiction and their subversive effect and so they subverted their own propaganda with hypocrisy there were reward for success to a degree establishing the principle of 'everyone is equal but some are more equal than others so well summarized in george orwell 's animal farm it turned out that not even the chessboard wa safe from politics a i discovered when i began my assault on chess olympus and the reigning world champion establishment darling anatoly karpov thanks to chess i also had the rare privilege of foreign travel a a teenager which gave me the chance to witness the horror of capitalism and democracy with my own eye high living standard functioning institution a vibrant civil society it did n't take long for me to realize that the west wa the real world and it wa my home that wa the charade i began to speak publicly about this disconnect in interview with western publication pushing my luck a a celebrity and also pushing the edge of creeping liberalization under mikhail gorbachev chess had long been an ideological tool to promote the superiority of the soviet man over the selfish and lazy west so it wa quite a scandal for the soviet world champion to proclaim his admiration for american a 'close to true human nature a i did in the summer of 'to playboy magazine no le when ronald reagan went to berlin and demanded that gorbachev 'tear down this wall in it wa difficult for most of u living behind that wall to imagine it fall could be anything but a blessing for u it wa not mere rhetoric it wa a tangible demonstration that people on the outside cared about our fate and were fighting to free u from it having been raised to think of the united state a an enemy that might bomb u into oblivion at any moment this evolution to thinking of the u s a an ally'of the soviet people against our leaders'was no small transition how are the oppressed people of russia iran and syria supposed to feel about america today when they see obama making deal that empower their despotic ruler the end of the cold war also marked a transition of how american were perceived in the world and how they perceived themselves it 's one thing to be the good guy in the movie when there is an evil empire to vanquish with no rival worth the effort after the ussr 's collapse the white cowboy hat of ronald reagan wa retired it made a brief reappearance on the uneasy head of george w bush after but the catastrophic outcome of his invasion of iraq put it back in the closet regardless of where you stand on the iraq war and because of my background i can not condemn any action that remove a dictator that it took so much campaigning and falsified evidence to generate public support wa a clear sign that american had moved on from the business of fighting evil but the iraq war wa a rebuke to bad planning and lousy implementation not a refutation of the idea that america can be an essential force for good in the world america must do better not do nothing no matter how much the isolationist and pacifist want to believe it the jihadist dictator and other threat to american life and it interest will not disappear even if the u s continues to retreat from every global challenge and conflict nor will ceding geopolitical influence and security commitment to other nation make the world safer or more stable especially if that power is ceded to aggressive dictatorship like iran and putin 's russia europe is closer to the front line against jihadism and putin 's aggression but ha let it military atrophy along with it will to use it the complete lack of a coherent eu security policy mean that unless the united state rediscovers it role a an active force for stability and security in the world both stability and security are in trouble if stopping the islamic state is a real priority'as obama say it is a every candidate say it is a the american people say it is'then it should not be so difficult to discard the policy that have clearly failed to do so seventy year ago harry truman built new institution and made a huge investment in stabilizing europe and stopping the advance of communism world wide the cia nsc nato voice of america and the marshall plan intervention in greece taiwan and korea all part an ambitious economic military and communication offensive to fight and win the cold war the gop fought truman on many of these bold plan a did member of his own cabinet but eventually the containment model wa accepted by the republican eisenhower and every subsequent administration a a necessity so far marco rubio is the only prominent candidate to demonstrate the preparation and instinct to return america to it vital role but even he ha been limited by poll number and intimidated by the focus group that insist america should mind it own business until it go out of business i hope that there is still a place in for an optimistic vision that call for using america 's incredible resource to help instead of harm to build instead of bomb to free the oppressed instead of bargaining with their oppressor and to protect the innocent instead of considering them collateral damage american have become accustomed to demanding the impossible and their politician have become accustomed to providing it massive debt fuel education and the stock market call for greater security are accompanied by a refusal to invest or sacrifice to achieve it the bipartisan acceptance of reality ha gone missing in america 's hyper partisan political environment the idea that america must be a force for stability and freedom ha been abandoned by washington reflecting an american main street more interested in fleeting stock market value than in the lasting value of global democracy wa a dangerous year and will be even more dangerous unless america remembers what it stand for,14641.0

moment of american crime 's most recent episode the line provides another gasp inducing conclusion similar to one that have capped the three episode aired thus far of the abc limited series ' woefully underrated and underappreciated second season it 's a fun and frustrating exercise to parse the line and compare it to the iconic dialogue that is currently tantalizing viewer on the x file a limited series that is plagued by the opposite issue endured by american crime overhype and excessive excitement 'the truth is out there 'i want to believe the truth in question here is about alien and government conspiracy and a whole lot of other supernatural silliness what huffman 's character a prep school headmaster named leslie is referring to is more haunting than anything referred to on the x file it 's not 'out there it 's here it 's in our neighborhood our home ourselves and it 's scary a hell after an award winning first season that tackled race religion and injustice john ridley 's american crime series is back with many of his same actor huffman emmy winner regina king and timothy hutton return but different character a different setting a different crisis and different lesson the potpourri of issue examined in season two'rape homosexuality race privilege economic disparity bullying the age of social medium the education system'are so plentiful and potent that they should emit some noxious scent of didacticism and patronizing finger wagging when combined together instead american crime provokes and punishes delicately prodding our ability for compassion and then harshly startling u into the realization of our own prejudice it is the most explosive and most essential series airing on network television right now with wednesday night 's riveting fourth episode the crowning achievement of the first leg of it stellar second season so why are n't more people talking about it we 're in a renaissance of sort for the true crime genre show like making a murderer the jinx and the upcoming people v o j simpson command our attention with a 'you ca n't make this up real word resonance they 're the antidote to the glut of fantasy horror soap epic that have otherwise dominated television there 's a scope no doubt to the breadth and ambition of american crime and a certain grandness to the power it command but it 's been flying under the radar when the question it asks and the answer it ca n't give you should be announcing the show a must watch television heck it took a blizzard induced house arrest to motivate a sampling of the show for this writer'who is now livid it took him this long to catch on here 's the basic premise if a storyline this layered and with this many tangents'each worth peeling away and traveling down

shared and mocked online he 's branded 'wt for white trash and suspended from school for violating it behavior code when taylor who had a history of being bullied at his school tell his mother lili

to blame strong armed by a schoolmaster leslie huffman who doe n't want to stir controversy that could destroy her student ' reputation or more importantly her school 's taylor turn to the police reporting her son 's rape a witch hunt ensues with different party a eager to cover their ass a they are to assign blame deserved or not most alarming are the reaction to taylor 's rape claim expression of disbelief falling on the spectrum from 'he wa asking for it to 'boys ca n't be raped taylor 's mother go to the press in hope of putting pressure on the school to do something about it

to control the narrative in a moment of crisis this all come barreling forward with thursday night 's bombshell episode leslie 's attempt at damage control desperately working to keep her school from appearing complicit in the scandal are so calculated they come off a callous at first she seems empathetic to taylor when receiving the police report saying he wa raped then she seems most interested in scapegoating 'we need to give the police a name she tell timothy hutton 's coach dan sullivan 'any name he asks a she sits at a table with the school 's board member debating a course of action'each member 's scoff at the rape accusation more homophobic and appalling than the one before'she outline her concern which have nothing to do with taylor 's safety or well being 'so we should just hope that people believe the for profit private institution did n't conspire against the young man on financial aid who wa constantly bullied even before people found out he wa apparently gay she say 'it 's na ve to think this school will get an objective hearing the cynicism is appalling and you can practically hear it happening at the private school in your neighborhood right now kevin 's parent played by regina king and andre l benjamin are mostly concerned with maintaining their son 's innocence at whatever cost spurning any plea by eric 's father to defend their boy together given the fact that the lacroixs can afford a lawyer and he ca n't 'that boy will get the benefit of the doubt you wo n't get kevin 's mother tell him when he say he want to help eric too race economic privilege and the justice system'all packed into one line she know that her son will be painted guilty by a witch hunting medium because of his race if they do n't get in front of the situation quickly suddenly our culture of outrage and jury by blogger arrives too there 's coach sullivan 's loyalty to his team compounded by the indignation he and his wife played by hope davis who have a teenage daughter attending the prep school share over the sexual promiscuity of these teenager that might lead to the sort of sexual violence that is setting their community alight'particularly when it 's revealed that girl who attended the basketball party in question were expected to have sex with at least one of the team 's player the ritual is called 'making the team everything come to a head though in the last act of wednesday 's episode when after attempting to commit suicide eric admits that he had sex with taylor at the party and ha email text and grindr conversation to prove that taylor wa meeting him consensually the reason that he chose to attempt suicide rather than go to the police he wa afraid how people would react to finding out he 's gay when taylor and his mother are confronted with eric 's side of the story taylor'who wish the entire controversy would all go away'must tell his mom that though he arrived for consensual sex that is not what happened'all the while coming out to her a gay for the first time every turn of event is alternately heartbreaking and infuriating kindling a rage fire because of how realistically everyone 's action and more importantly reaction reflect our own behavior and world it take deft writing to weave all these perspective and issue into such a compelling tapestry the directing too is so unusual and powerful when character are in conversation with a minor figure'taylor and the woman conducting his rape kit and exam for example'the camera stay centered on the main character even when they are n't speaking i 'm not sure i 've seen a show that provides a more dignified showcase for talented actress over the age of that the rest of hollywood doe n't seem to know what to do with felicity huffman regina king hope davis and lili taylor'taylor delivering a performance that if there 's anything to be said for taste should win every acting award next year'all get to play would you believe it real people they are people who do n't cater to sympathy or likability but who are selfish and motivated by the same thing that motivate all of u protecting ourselves and our interest escaping blame and sticking true to our own belief no matter how myopic they might be they operate under the limitation of our intelligence and empathy a lot of what they do is ugly but it 's not per se wrong they are not bad people they are real people they are real people who should remind u of ourselves and that should make u uncomfortable and then there are the performance by jessup jackson and pollari these kid are broken the system is broken and it seems like nothing can be fixed this is a rave review of a show that because of the scale of it ambition and the range of issue it attempt to confront is certainly messy and flawed that 's what make it seem all the more human that 's what make it the truth,29700.0

your throat and i 'm gon na cut the throat of your father and mother and brother and sister said the man on the paris metro rambling on and on in a louder and louder voice because people were ignoring him it wa a few minute before dawn on new year 's day and the no line wa fairly empty the reveler of the night before were gone most of the people aboard were black or brown and heading for work on what wa for other people a holiday the guy who wa shouting who mentioned in his rant that he wa from north africa stank of alcohol and while people did move a few seat away from him they did n't get off before their stop they did n't call the police they made their calculation about the risk from one drunk lunatic jihadi or no and on this cold dawn of a new year they went on with their life in france now almost one year after the carnage at the office of the satirical magazine charlie hebdo and the slaughter at a kosher supermarket and barely seven week since the massacre on the night of friday november that took life people are still uneasy still somber a one cosmopolitan arab visitor who used to live here opined over a glass of ro at the caf de flore 'it 's like the city ha had a stroke it had it problem it wa getting along but now nothing 's quite right indeed this ha been a year of living very dangerously in france'perhaps more dangerously than most people realize even now because near miss are soon forgotten and when terrorist screw up they are written off a fool which many of them are few people today remember the idiot who in april went to attack a church in villejuif a suburb of paris shot himself in the leg called an ambulance and had his whole arsenal discovered then in june there wa the thug who had a fight with his employer at a chemical plant near lyon killed him cut off his head and put it on a fence with islamist flag around it before failing to blow up some storage tank the murderer recently hanged himself in prison in august some buff young american soldier on vacation and a middle aged brit wrestled a would be mass murderer to the floor on a high speed train between brussels and paris the threat have been constant and yet people do get on with their life and they do calculate their risk and that is one reason that by the ten of thousand they are reading gilles kepel 's new book written with antoine jardin terreur dans l'hexagone gen se du djihad fran ai 'terror in france genesis of the french jihad no other work published to date reveals with such clarity and in such granular detail the evolution of islamist terror in this country and the implication that that evolution ha for the rest of the world including and especially the united state and few book could be more timely it wa in galley when the nov attack took place and updated in a matter of day it wa published in mid december in a lengthy interview on sunday kepel told the daily beast that what he call rd generation or g jihad which the so called islamic state appears to have mastered ha managed to blend an extremist ideology with the emotion of the street not only among some of those people of muslim and arab descent just coming of age in a society that ha been loathe to embrace them but among disaffected convert to islam who might have been drawn to other radical ideology in the past kepel warns that the organizer and proselytizers of daesh a the french call isi will find way to adapt their preaching and plan to the peculiarity of american society too 'san bernardino said kepel pointing to the massacre in california on dec to illustrate his point 'it wa a blend of columbine the availability of and obsession with weapon with the daesh ideology and the long term aim 'to try to blow up america to begin to understand how to address such a threat one ha to understand it in detail which is what kepel set out to do in this his latest book in a decade long career chronicling islamist extremism the original working title of the new book wa 'ten year that shook the world and that would have been more accurate perhaps because the french jihad kepel detail ha become especially over this last year the vanguard of a much bigger effort by both al qaeda and daesh to take their war to the european and american heartland the decade in question began in with two key event the one most widely remembered wa the stunning eruption of violence in the banlieues of city all over france 'paris is burning declared hyperventilating anchor on american cable news network a mob set about torching car and battling with police in a spontaneous reaction to the death of two young men electrocuted when hiding from the cop near a big transformer in the end although the riot spread to city all over the country the death toll three people wa very low by comparison in los angeles in people were killed but in france the alienation and anger among the child of immigrant wa palpable that same year the most important ideologue of new generaton jihad abu musab al suri published online his page tome the call for an international islamic resistance suri originally wa from syria but knew europe well he had lived for a while in britain in the community of arab and muslim exile there sometimes called londonistan his core idea wa that muslim in the west though increasingly numerous felt themselves isolated and under pressure and this could be exploited to create a breakdown of society develop insurgency and launch a civil war where the force of islam eventually would be victorious act of terror dubbed 'resistance by muslim under attack would heighten the already existing 'islamophobia and 'exacerbate the contradiction a communist revolutionary used to say until hatred and suspicion ran high and integration became impossible at the same time in the decade between the riot of october november and the slaughter in paris on nov the influence of salafi islam one of the most conservative strain grew dramatically in part of france with large muslim population it proselytizers drew a line between the western value of mainstream french culture and those of people who believe they are emulating the medieval way of the prophet muhammad france had faced the terror of jihad before in the s jihadist group made their first push to take power in north africa from french and american backed government these 'first generation terrorist eventually attacked target in france including a commuter train at saint michel near notre dame de paris in but the police hunted down the leader of the frency cell and in algeria and egypt by the group ' savage tactic had alienated the people they had expected to support them the second generation of jihad which grew out of the first wa al qaeda osama bin laden also hoped to overthrow the government of muslim country around the world while intimidating their western supporter with spectacular attack like those against the united state on september but while bin laden created chaos his organization wa never able to capitalize on it although al qaeda plotted to carry out attack in france including plan to hit the u s embassy here in the french intelligence service working closely with the american managed to stop it time and again but perhaps the french cop and spook grew complacent or more likely overwhelmed the number of people with file marked 's for security risk kept growing and the cop could n't track everybody in march at the height of the french presidential election campaign a year old petty criminal named mohamed merah went on a rampage in the southern city of toulouse and montauban first killing off duty french soldier he believed were from muslim background then shooting up a jewish school where three child were among his victim before finally after a long siege at his apartment he wa killed described a a 'lone wolf terrorist at the time merah wa anything but kepel trace meticulously the link among group of extremist many of them criminal radicalized in prison which lead from merah to the battlefield of the so called islamic state in syria and iraq and back to paris with the attack in the model of a g jihadist say kepel is not ch rif kouachi or his brother sa d who murdered people inside the charlie hebdo office and a policeman a muslim outside they claimed they were exacting revenge for the publication of cartoon satirizing mohammed and muslim and they were acting on a long delayed mission from the al qaeda affiliate in yemen the model we can learn from say kepel is ahmed coulibaly another terrorist who texted to a contact in syria that the kouachis were 'zigotos weirdo coulibaly claimed to have funded the attack on charlie hebdo when the kouachis apparently could n't get their act or their gun together and he carried out his own attack on a kosher supermarket two day later murdering four jew before dying in a hail of bullet from the police coulibaly whose family originally wa from mali wa born in france in and from the time he wa a teenager spent much of his life in jail for various relatively minor crime but then he turned himself into the model ex prisoner winning in an invitation to the lys e palace to meet president nicolas sarkozy skilled at dissimulation he married a woman who 'd lost her job because she insisted on wearing a veil but then the two of them posed for a selfie with her wearing a bikini in the day after the charlie hebdo attack coulibaly left behind two testament one intentional one not and both very revealing in his video farewell to the world probably filmed on jan after he had murdered a black policewoman and a he wa preparing for his attack on the kosher supermarket he pledged allegiance to the so called caliph of the so called islamic state coulibaly then laid out the argument that were at the core of al suri 's call of 'islamic resistance the terror attack are all about self defense in a world where muslim are constantly under attack and he call on other young muslim in france and elsewhere to follow his example to defend allah and their sister and 'whole population under assault by the infidel the second unintentional testament came when a french radio network called the kosher market during the siege and coulibaly picked up the phone he then put it down but failed to hang up and his chilling dialogue with the hostage he 's getting ready to kill wa recorded the law he followed he said wa an eye for an eye and they should understand that he told them always in g jihad the killer claim that all they want is justice'as they see it god 's justice on monday the french daily le monde published the cover of the forthcoming special issue of charlie hebdo 'one year later the murderer is still on the run it proclaims next to a cartoon figure of god a bearded old man in a long robe with a masonic eye above his head a kalashnikov slung over his back and blood spattered on his beard and clothing a year ago charlie hebdo wa on the verge of bankruptcy and bought by only a few thousand people each week the print run for this new issue reportedly will be about million copy with ten of thousand sent to germany and other country where there 's high demand if the intention of the weirdo kouachi brother wa to do away with charlie hebdo they failed miserably it ha never in it history been so solvent but the greatest fail wa the jihadist ' attempt a year ago to tear french society apart in the event the mass demonstration on jan last year'with upwards of four million people taking to the street in france to declare 'je suis charlie 'represented a massive powerful refutation of everything the terror strategist intended yet after the attack of november there were no such demonstration indeed mass gathering were banned by the government for fear they would be attacked the way the caf s and the concert hall and the sport stadium had been attacked on the night of the th many thing had changed between january and november the massive flow of refugee from syria into europe had unnerved the continent and showed the deep division in the collection of nation state that call itself the european union the syrian war continues with no end in sight and isi appears neither defeated nor contained but perhaps worst of all the traditional politician in france and europe have failed almost completely to understand the generation of citizen who were born and grew up here and who want very much to be part of the country and part of it future al suri wanted to enlist them in his great plan for 'islamic resistance but that 's not what most of them wanted in the presidential election of million of child of immigrant were able to vote for the first time and they did so massively against the fear mongering tough guy incumbent sarkozy and for the socialist fran ois hollande who beat him by a slim margin but those vote did not translate into job or a stake in the future such are the failure of the sclerotic political class in france in fact that in the last few year many people have come to feel their only choice is to move toward the extreme for many that ha meant the ultra right wing national front of the shrewd and charismatic marine le pen for others it ha meant a further drift toward islamism and even salafism and after the hugely positive emotion of the 'je suis charlie demonstration on january had subsided story surfaced of the high school kid who refused to observe a minute of silence and of those who said 'je suis charlie coulibaly but what did such anecdote mean did the action of a few posturing kid translate into a movement that favor the jihadist if so then it is particularly ironic that the nov attack may actually have worked against the design of isi and it minion research by kepel and his colleague suggests the slaughter that night provoked a strong negative reaction among young french people from muslim background the isi killer went after target where they knew there would be a lot of them enjoying life in the city of light even among jihadist in french prison kepel told the daily beast the attack were condemned and likened to the act of the reviled kharijite sect in the th and th century which made it a practice to kill other muslim 'for the first time we had all the arab with u said kepel 'for the first time they considered they were french because they were targeted because of the way they lived whether that will last in the current political climate is doubtful a even hollande a socialist is promoting an idea that originated with le pen taking french nationality away from people allegedly involved with terrorist organization who have second passport the implication is that all those dual national mostly north african are something le than french when the no got to trocad ro i got out the drunk jihadist wa still shouting a the train pulled away i mounted the stair to the esplanade to look out over the eiffel tower a the sun came up men from sub saharan africa were already peddling souvenir men from north africa already had warmed up the grill of the snack bar woman tourist wearing veil posed with their family for selfies there were cloud all around the tower but the sun wa still fighting to get through and people got on with their life in the troubled nation that is france today,8954.0

time in a many year her voice ha risen in sorrow beside the coffin of a murdered friend and because the voice is hers it is also the sound of decency and perseverance made divine amid a war involving at least gang faction in our president 's hometown each one of those funeral wa a reminder of the danger trishaun herself face each time she step outside her door she wa forced to quit a job a a sale associate just a few block from where she life because it wa in the territory of a gang whose member recognized her from a facebook picture the nearest sandwich shop is also outside her home turf and she realizes that to venture there is to risk being the next person in a coffin 'if i go to subway i could lose my life the year old told the daily beast late last week 'it 's my life for a sandwich yet a one friend after another ha been killed she ha continued to venture out early each morning to class at olive harvey college where she is a fine art major 'i 'm in my last semester she reported quietly a if it were not a remarkable accomplishment she ha two great wish for the immediate future one is that she get picked when she audition for the voice in february 'they said to get there at o'clock in the morning she said 'i 'll be there at her other wish is that she not be needed to be a funeral singer yet again she certainly had not been seeking that role a she stood with her year old boyfriend roemello golden outside a housing complex in south chicago known a the building on june 'it wa a nice day she recalled 'it wa a normal day it wa real warm roemello wa an up and coming rapper known a young ro he had founded his own music company global money entertainment or gme and he had tried without success to get the dulcet toned trishaun to try setting aside her cherished gospel song and join him in his genre 'he used to be so mad i would n't she later recalled the two remained so close they lingered together a night deepened and the others outside the building dispersed 'everybody left she would remember a year old named keon tolliver approached keon wa from another turf six block away but he knew roemello from their childhood year keon held out his hand roemello took it 'he shook his hand trishaun would recall 'he asked him 'what 's up ' keon seemed like just another of the legion of people who liked this rap star in the making 'everybody loved roemello trishaun would later say keon then suddenly pulled a semi automatic pistol and began firing 'it just happened fast trishaun would later say 'it just happened real fast roemello 's final reflex wa to save her 'he pushed me away trishaun would report trishaun escaped injury a roemello wa fatally wounded by at least bullet the police afterward described the murder a gang related saying roemello wa affiliated with a faction called the titanic stone roemello 's friend insisted that gme wa a rap enterprise not a gang some suggested that the killer may have been motivated by jealousy or by a desire for what had replaced bling and benjamin a the prime motivator in the street 'they call it clout trishaun told the daily beast 'everybody want clout she added 'everybody fighting for the same thing 'i 'm more powerful than you ' in trishaun had sung at the funeral for her best friend year old shayla raymond who wa killed by a hit and run driver after some boy chased her from a bus stop into the street trishaun now sang at roemello 's funeral she chose 'his eye on the sparrow then came the funeral for kevin sander and the funeral for deandre brown and the funeral for valerie gonzalez her hope for a better ended just five day into the new year with word that year old donta parker and year old sakinah reed had been shot to death 'i wa just saying 'i do n't want to sing at any more funeral ' trishaun recalled 'but they were my friend the killing had come just three hour after president obama began to weep during a televised speech about gun violence the latest victim in his hometown had been walking from the bus after school along with a year old friend known a gmebe bravo when a ford expedition rolled up sakinah had posted on twitter a photo of herself back on nov wearing a t shirt emblazened with the face of a murdered friend 'knew my time wa coming'had to wait for it she had tweeted but a dec posting had taken a le fatalistic turn sakinah tweeted of someday escaping the carnage 'when i go to college im not coming back to chicago she tweeted at a m right around the time the president wa in tear about gun violence one of sakinah 's loved one tweeted hopefully of living long enough to see the teen officially reach adulthood 'just want to be here for blood birthday and then imma good the loved one tweeted now at p m sakinah and her two friend were desperately trying to flee the gunfire that suddenly erupted from inside the expedition she suffered two fatal wound to the back donta a fatal wound to the abdomen their blood spattering bright red on the snow the police would later say that this shooting wa also gang related alleging by way of background that gme had allied with ebe'eastbound entertainment'which wa supposedly affiliated with a faction called sircon city gme insisted that ebe also wa not a gang but a rap group and that the two had joined to form gmebe the group wa popular enough that when they played in faraway jacksonville florida in november the fan proved to know the lyric to their song a longtime gangbanger suggested that donta had been targeted because he and a friend had posted a video made at a citgo gas station in pockettown territory the video show them dissing not only pockettown but one of the gang 's dead known a ronnie moe who had been held in a high regard a the murdered young ro had been held in his own but gme would contend that donta and sakinah died in a case of mistaken identity saying that a voice from inside the murder car had asked if the three victim were affiliated with a faction called sircon city gme say the shooting started before there wa time to answer the third teen bravo wa shot in the foot and hand he emphatically denies a newspaper report that he helped police identify the shooter a year old anthony murphy who police say is affiliated with pockettown bravo told the daily beast that he had uttered not so much a word when the police came to question him after he wa discharged from the hospital 'they wa knocking on my door bravo said 'i would n't even answer it a sidewalk vigil for the murdered teen wa planned for p m the next day on the stretch of burley avenue where they had grown up together living in the same building their apartment facing each other roemello had also lived on this street and it wa locally known a roeblock in keeping with a relatively recent chicago custom of naming street after young gunshot victim a friend of sakinah 's family asked a year old daughter of a chicago firefighter turned pastor to lead the gathering dyesha deisch'who is trishaun ' s cousin'had never led such an event but she knew all too much about gun violence having lost a brother who had played college football and hoped to join the fbi only to be shot to death by a stranger outside a club she agreed to the request but asked that the time of the vigil be changed to p m before evening deepened to night she wa initially unnerved by the number of attendee filling the street when she arrived 'three hundred kid she recalled to the daily beast 'i 'm like 'i do n't think i can do this ' the kid were out there cry they were hugging each other they were angry some had question like 'why god ' deisch had brought some anointing oil and she devised an impromptu ritual she instructed the attendee to form a huge circle and clasp hand with the person beside them be it a boy or a girl 'i said 'i need you all to get in the middle of the street and unite this thing she remembered 'when they finally held hand i said 'god give me strength ' she then began to anoint their forehead one after another the intimacy of the blessing imparting a sense of what these kid were feeling 'some of them i anointed i began to feel their burden she would remember she called upon the almighty 'everybody that 's knitted in this circle god remember them right now god cover them from the top of their head to the sol of their foot god she prayed 'put a hex of protection around each and every one of them god it 's ok for y'all to cry she invoked psalm 'weeping may endure for the night but joy come in the morning the next word she cried out applied equally to these kid and to their president 'it 's ok to cry deisch understood just a the president understood that the carnage wa sure to continue 'this is not the end she said she and the daily beast later spoke with the six member of gmebe in an apartment in the complex known a the building bravo had made a video in the hospital of his wound and he had since written a song titled 'demon 'd up he had posted a professional looking music video for it in which he waved his bandaged finger 'we demon 'd up do n't play with u he rapped predictably but also saying 'every night i have a dream'every night i wake up in sweat a he now spoke to deisch and the daily beast bravo said he had penned a second deeper rap 'that make me cry he said he noted that he had known donta since they were in first grade together at the nearby j n thorp elementary school he said he still could not quite believe that what happened had actually happened 'it just do n't feel real he said 'it wa just a regular day we got off the bus we got caught lackin ' he meant caught without a gun 'you got to carry a pistol he said 'you literally have to he reported that his music video have given him a kind of celebrity that can make him a target wherever he go 'my face is always on somebody phone he said 'if i sit on the bus people going 'that 's bravo he went on 'that fame i do n't want i want the fame that inspires people he dreamed aloud 'i see myself selling out madison square garden that 's all i want to do one time deisch advised the whole group'whose senior member include another of her cousin known a gmebe pistol'that they needed to be more positive and take their music beyond the now well worn chicago 'drill music drilling being slang for shooting 'everybody know you got a gun she said bravo did not disagree he wa coming to appreciate the importance of reading 'you need to read if you rap because you ca n't be saying the same thing he said 'your vocabulary should expand you should have wordplay i 'm going to make myself more of a lyrical artist change my flow up but if he wanted to go the nearest branch of the public library he wa in hostile territory the group 's manager asked bravo if he would rather go shopping for clothes or a gun 'a brand new glock bravo said one of the other member gmebe allo noted 'it 's a risk for u even to get a pair of shoe it 's just a lot that go on deisch had another warning for them if they kept on a they had been 'they got a casket for each one of you all she said 'or a jail cell she afterward gave bravo a ride home 'what 's this war about she asked him 'i do n't know bravo said 'you 're in the middle of a war and you do n't know what it 's about she asked 'i honestly do n't he replied deisch is also cousin to trishaun who sang once again at a funeral this time for donta the song she chose wa 'take me to the king shot were fired from a passing car after the funeral a well a after the repast 'they want clout deisch said of the gunman 'two people are n't enough for them trishaun wa spared singing at sakinah 's funeral she wa back to hoping that she had sung at her last funeral a she sat with deisch on jan on what would have been martin luther king jr 's th birthday king would have applauded the indomitable character not just of trishaun but also of deisch who is one of the neighborhood 's truly heroic figure at deisch took her godmother 's three children'aged and 'into her care the godmother and the child 's father were both incarcerated and the child no doubt would have otherwise been consigned to foster care deisch spent a decade raising them a she would have her own while working three job and continuing her education earning first a bachelor 's degree and then a master 's in social work she wa on the go at a m each day and she kept going until after p m 'i made sure they saw me work my tail off she said of the kid to the daily beast 'i showed them you can do it i took them to church i got them busy deisch could now report that her two oldest charge had landed good paying job the youngest now is sending out his r sum deisch wa a social worker and raising a year old son of her own trishaun had also secured a good job but she had been forced to quit because it wa a half dozen block away in what wa called slaughtertown which considers those from roeblock to be 'opps or the opposition the enemy these day such thing in chicago are decided not by membership in a particular gang but simply by where you happen to live not by who you are with but where you are from 'i ca n't walk out my door without being afraid trishaun said 'do i go left or right if i go right i might get shot greater danger lie beyond the boundary of her home turf which is bereft of basic amenity 'no store no laundromat she said 'we do n't have anything in our neighborhood she sometimes risk going to another neighborhood to get something to eat but she ha to remain on high alert 'i never sit in a restaurant she said 'it 's really scary i 'm scared to do anything she further understands that hers is a city where a perceived slight can mean your end 'if you bruise their ego it 's over trishaun said 'once your bruise their ego they are not going to stop until they kill you that prominently includes even seemingly minor insult online 'social medium is the root of all evil she said 'social medium can get you killed she spoke of one young woman whose picture had been posted on a fake page along with an image of a baby with wing the wing signifying the baby wa with the angel which is to say dead the image is sure to cause great offense and could lead to the woman 's all too actual death 'she dying for nothing because somebody using her picture trishaun said trishaun said she had asked a friend of the two latest fatality in roeblock how he wa feeling 'he said 'i 'm used to it so it doe n't bother me she recalled deisch wondered aloud 'how do you get back to normal it 's becoming normal to them and that 's not normal she added 'these young people have been turned cold they call each other demon she noted that the street are now about gun not drug 'these kid do n't even want to make money deisch said she who had seen the power of love while successfully raising her godmother 's kid wa now seeing the result of it absence in too many other kid 'all it go back to is no love she said the result turn deadly when the lack of love is joined by the power of a gun and no sense of consequence 'thinking they 're invincible trishaun said of the young gunman deisch reminded everyone that it wa what she called 'martin luther king 's actual birthday 'he gave his life for u she noted she spoke of those who joined king in the struggle 'they got spat on got beaten got killed did all this she said 'for u to turn

scold and chastise celebrity in the ballroom for their distracting chatter refusal to take their seat when the show wa back from commercial and for generally being inconsiderate misbehaving hollywood egotist like we expect them to be hi hollywood when mark wahlberg is suggesting that maybe you 're being rude something 's wrong all these transgression combined to produce what wa simultaneously one of the most shocking and most dull golden globe in a long time the sharp smart wit of amy poehler and tina fey were sorely missed a were winner that made even a lick of sense what is everyone most buzzed about here were the night 's buzziest moment ricky gervais ' vicious monologue 'shh shut up you disgusting pill popping sexually deviant scum and with one sentence ricky gervais wa back'and we were over him oh he did his ricky gervais thing he wa hired to roast the room to bite the hand that feed him and to make everyone watching at home gasp and clutch their pearl what nbc wa probably not anticipating however is how aggressively the celebrity in the ballroom were not having one bit of it some joke were lazy like gag about caitlyn jenner 's transition and jeffrey tambor 's 'bravery acting in transparent and how hard it must be to hide his ball in a dress ha ha who had money on two arguably transphobic joke in the first three minute update we counted at least two more the rest of

's true later a riff on the worthlessness of the golden globe a award culminated with his insistence that he us one of the trophy he ha won a a sex toy 'to be clear that wa a joke about me shoving a

appeared at the golden globe the homophobic misogynistic racist anti semitic actor wa announced a a presenter in a press release perhaps it should n't even be considered a shock that an organization a notoriously star and fame obsessed a the hollywood foreign press would turn a blind eye to such behavior and give gibson the equivalent of an acquittal for his past misdeed an invite to the industry 's biggest party no what shocked wa the tone deaf way gervais ' ribbing of him wa laid out so that we might feel slightly bad for gibson'and if not at least nod approvingly at what a good sport he wa being by allowing himself to be mocked by the acerbic host gibson even had his chance at some redemptive one liner the audience did n't know whether to laugh or run screaming the thing everyone will be talking about no doubt wa the petulant giddiness with which gervais asked gibson which wa bleeped on live tv 'what the fuck doe sugar tit even mean the whole thing wa just gross and inexcusable jonah hill and channing tatum 's revenant bear bit there wa a solid gimmick in channing tatum and jonah hill 's overlong bit that had hill pretending to be the bear from the revenant seizing a big

every other sentence hill said wa bleeped on live tv leaving u with the image of jonah hill in a bear costume mouthing word in complete silence it wa unbearable get it because he wa a bear i 'm here all night and arguably funnier than this bit the constant cursing remember when famous people used to be classy enough to resist cursing when they were on live tv after tonight i do n't following hill 's entirely bleeped sketch the big punchline to amy schumer 's bit with jennifer lawrence wa silenced because of profanity blindspot star jamie alexander making her big golden globe debut cursed at a faulty teleprompter 'who 's typing this shit then of course there wa the biggest censoring of the night gervais ' money line to mel gibson which gervais proudly unbleeped later on twitter for those

park in yorktown height with his recent remark about mexican and muslim trump 'has shown himself to be a bigot said the creator of an online petition urging the name change just a few mile further up the taconic state parkway however is another state park named after a public figure who made disparaging remark about various minority group this other gentleman once complained to an interviewer that 'the foreign element were failing to 'conform to the manner and the custom of most american he believed the kind of immigrant that would benefit america would be european with 'blood of the right sort he warned that 'the mingling of white with oriental blood on an extensive scale is harmful to our future citizenship he also boasted that he helped bring about a quota on jewish student admitted to harvard he worried about jew 'overcrowding the profession and he wa convinced that 'the best way to settle the jewish question essentially is to spread the jew thin all over the world these may be the kind of sentiment many would imagine to have been expressed by donald trump but in fact they were uttered by franklin delano roosevelt thirty second president of the united state it go without saying that the difference between the two men are vast it is a monumental understatement to note that fdr 's accomplishment a president dwarf trump 's achievement a a real estate developer and entertainer yet in their attitude toward foreigner and immigration they had more in common than is generally realized like many upper class white protestant of his time fdr harbored a strong disdain for most immigrants'except for those with 'blood of the right sort a he put it in a newspaper column he wrote in he advocated restricting immigration for 'a good many year to come and limiting subsequent immigration to those who could be most quickly and easily assimilated how different is that from what mr trump is currently advocating roosevelt wa deeply suspicious of japanese immigrant they 'are not capable of assimilation into the american population he wrote in another column 'anyone who ha traveled in the far east know that the mingling of asiatic blood with european or american blood produce in nine case out of ten the most unfortunate result these remark were not some youthful indiscretion on fdr 's part he wa already a mature public figure and a rising political star having served a a new york state senator assistant secretary of the navy and the democrat ' vice presidential nominee nor could fdr 's statement be chalked up to off color humor although he did indulge in his share of that presidential secretary william d hassett wrote in his diary of roosevelt telling a joke that described the japanese people a the offspring of an ancient union between human and baboon fdr 's grandson curtis roosevelt recalled that the president 'would tell mildly anti semitic story in the white house in which 'the protagonist were always lower east side jew with heavy accent sometimes humor can be very revealing roosevelt did not keep a diary or tape record his oval office conversation a some later president did what we know of his private view of jew come mostly from third party who were friendly to fdr and did not expect his statement to be made public for example it wa fdr 's friend u s senator pat harrison who helped clinch the nomination of roosevelt at the democratic convention who noted the president 's use of the phrase 'dirty jewish trick to characterize a tax maneuver by the owner of the new york time in it wa the era 's most prominent jewish leader and fdr stalwart rabbi stephen s wise who privately recounted a conversation in which the president alleged that jewish domination of poland 's economy wa the cause of polish antisemitism u s senator burton wheeler a roosevelt friend and political ally jotted down a remark that fdr made to him in 'you and i burt are old english and dutch stock'we know there is no jewish blood in our vein but a lot of other people do not know whether there is jewish blood in their vein or not treasury secretary henry morgenthau jr privately noted in fdr 's aforementioned statement about restricting the admission of jew to harvard and vice president henry wallace 's diary is the source of president roosevelt 's statement in about 'spreading the jew thin all over the world admitting no more than 'four or five jewish family in each community would be best wallace reported the president a recommending some will point out that such sentiment about asian and jew were common in those day but what make roosevelt 's remark particularly alarming is the likelihood that they played a role in some of his policy decision fdr had no compunction about herding more than people of japanese ancestry 'most of them american citizen ' into detention camp in in part because of his deeply held belief that person of japanese ancestry were inherently untrustworthy and dangerous asked by time magazine if he would have supported the internment of the japanese trump hedged 'i certainly hate the concept of it but i would have had to be there at the time to give you a proper answer roosevelt 's policy of turning away european jewish refugee who were seeking haven from hitler 'during year when the u s quota for german immigrant wa only filled ' likely wa based to some degree on his personal conviction that having too many jew in the country could lead to them having undue influence the president gave full expression to this perspective during a session of the casablanca conference he remarked that jewish resident of allied liberated region of north africa should not be allowed to 'overcrowd the profession because that could lead to the same kind of 'understandable complaint which the german bore towards the jew in germany namely that while they represented a small part of the population over fifty percent of the lawyer doctor school teacher college professor etc in germany were jew roosevelt 's statistic were of course wildly inflated all of which brings u back to the question at hand should public site bear the name of individual whose view on some subject are abhorrent if their record include some deed that were admirable and others that were not how should one be weighed against the other should we take into consideration the fact that fdr 's view probably influenced government policy and affected people 's life while trump 's are at least for now just bombastic rhetoric in a different world the name donald j trump and franklin d roosevelt might not be thought of in the same sentence but if motorist on the taconic state parkway are mortified when they pas the exit sign for donald j trump state park perhaps they should think twice when moment later they pas the sign for franklin d roosevelt state park sadly the two men had more in common than most people realize dr rafael medoff is the founding director of the david s wyman institute for holocaust study and author of

military commander in the war against the so called islamic state the administration is taking the glove off after more than a year of reluctance to target the terrorist 's core infrastructure for fear of hitting civilian or risking the life of american troop two recent strike on isi cash depot are example of idea once considered too risky that the administration is now embracing and one of those attack may have destroyed from half a billion to three quarter of a billion dollar two u s official said wednesday faced with the virulence of the isi brand and the clock ticking down on president barack obama 's last term administration official are green lighting aggressive proposal that have been languishing for year and asking for more idea to check the growth of isi from syria to libya and beyond according to multiple u s defense official they say the change in tactic are still 'incremental 'military commander and intelligence chief alike are loathe to put forward any sweeping proposal like expanding the single new elite special operation and intelligence fusion cell in northern iraq to four or five regional center but they say the obama administration is at last leaning into the fight 'you have to proceed in a way that incorporates partner feedback from iraq or other coalition member a senior administration official told the daily beast on background another official who also spoke on condition of anonymity said the u s ca n't ask for permission to dispatch more elite force until it prof the worth of the one it 's already sent official say the new aggressiveness is partly in response to the isi directed and inspired attack in paris and san bernadino which showed a virulence that produced violence faster than the administration expected at the same time there is an eye to the obama legacy the president who wanted to be known a the commander in chief who decimated al qaeda doe not want to go down in history a having ceded the battlefield to al qaeda 's successor isi toward that end secretary of defense ash carter said in paris last week that effort to hit isi would intensify even a he nagged coalition partner to up their effort chairman of the joint chief of staff gen joseph dunford told reporter that he may recommend embedding u s adviser with iraqi unit at remote base to help recapture mosul and spoke of a possible military solution to the growing isi movement in libya u s official say that while a small band of u s intelligence officer and special operator move in and out of libya trying to forge local tie to fight isi a more forward leaning coalition of the u s and other western country must wait for the libyan themselves to agree on a new government previous targeting within iraq and syria had been limited mostly to identifiable isi checkpoint safe house in remote area or fighter on the move which meant war plane and drone were expending hundred of thousand of dollar worth of ordnance to take out a truck or a shack those type of strike continue but the success of a few risky call ha given the administration more confidence and given the pentagon more room to maneuver among them a special operation raid inside syria last may and one to free isi prisoner inside iraq in october a well a the recent targeting of the isi oil infrastructure and cash reserve the may raid killed financier abu sayyaf but netted his wife and a yazidi slave plus computer and document that continue to help map the isi network the later raid to free isi prisoner inside iraq netted still more intelligence that cleared the way to a proposal to base in northern iraq an elite special operation expeditionary task force that wa declared operational in december it had taken six month from idea to deployment which frustrated some military commander and administration official but that 's light speed considering the obama administration 's original reluctance to increase u s troop number targeting isi 's oil network ha also led to a sudden cash crunch that ha forced isi to halve salary driving some foreign fighter to leave according to a senior intelligence official now multiple official say the white house is encouraging military planner to widen the strike zone even if it mean catching civilian in the crossfire and risking american troop ' life 'our hand have been tied said one senior military official 'now i think you 'll see a little more willingness to tolerate civilian casualty in the interest of making progress they 're also more willing to risk sending u s special operation team into syria to capture more isi leader alive for questioning by kurdish and iraqi force both to gather more intelligence and to make the isi leadership wonder what their captive comrade are sharing another key moving the obama white house into fight mode ha been the communication bridge built by defense secretary carter between the administration the pentagon and central command carter may not have been the administration 's first choice and he get some knock within the pentagon for keeping policymaking to a very small group of his closest adviser but military and intelligence official say he ha bridged the trust and comprehension gap between the white house the pentagon and central command 'carter play a more active role than his predecessor he 's made himself quite prominent in the isi fight said one senior military official 'he 's a detail guy it 's been well received there 's more clarity between washington and the outstation the recent strike against isi cash depot are emblematic because of the potential for civilian casualty central command sent the three possible cash depot target to carter for sign off he sent request for more information and eventually okayed two of the strike one on jan th and the second last week two u s official said one of the two strike hit the el rafidayn bank in mosul and destroyed up to three quarter of a billion dollar plus an estimated couple hundred pound of gold said the official speaking on condition of anonymity the official would not share the currency nor how military official came up with the estimate but acknowledged that u s intelligence had been studying isi 's communication after the strike the third target remains untouched but isi fighter morale ha plummeted and foreign fighter are deserting because salary have been halved according to the two u s official and a second senior administration official isi ha since moved much of the remaining cash to a hospital in mosul the official said carter hinted at more aggressive move to come from the special operation expeditionary targeting force or etf in comment to reporter a he traveled to paris to ask coalition partner to step up their contribution 'an etf like raid'the one that took down abu sayyaf and also the one that freed prisoners'they were both learning experience for u he said 'the more you 're on the ground the more you learn and therefore the more opportunity you have that 's the kind of raid that the man nominated to lead the isi fight know well gen joseph votel once led the joint special operation command which run the etf responsible for counterterrorist raid like the one that killed osama bin laden in and abu musab al zarqawi the leader of the isi precursor al qaeda in iraq in in comment to the daily beast votel hinted at a sweeping open ended fight in iraq syria and beyond 'it 's more than taking their territory it 's preventing their ability to govern nullifying their message taking away their resource cutting off their foreign fighter votel said 'i do n't think you could put a time limit on it he added 'i certainly would n't he earlier told an audience of current and former special operation official that he planned to get ahead of isi by beating them to the country ripe for a militant led uprising 'i see opportunity for u to engage in the area where isi is not established yet where they do n't control terrain directly but where there are disaffected population where we can begin to get in and work with our partner votel said at the national defense industry association 's special operation and low intensity conflict annual meeting in washington special operation troop have already been working in small number in place like somalia mali and other remote part of africa'a vanguard effort that could be expanded another top special operation official speaking at the conference michael lumpkin ha been tapped to run the state department 's information war against extremist group including isi former navy seal lumpkin wa blunt in his critique of administration effort to counter isi 's message so far saying it 'quite frankly need better direction and more resource he said special operation ' brand of 'speed and agility would help find technology to measure the impact of both isi 's message and the social medium content pumped out to counter it it wa a blunt jab at the existing campaign which ha produced little content to combat isi 's plus daily postings'and the content it ha produced ha been widely panned 'the u s government is not always the most effective messenger to contest this propaganda he said 'the most credible voice come from across the region and within vulnerable community while the nomination of votel and lumpkin seem to go along with a more aggressive white house campaign overall the fight against isi in iraq and syria is still not going fast enough for some official they complain that capping the u s troop to le than in iraq and relying on other coalition partner for other task to keep

consensus at least among the berniebros although 'off key would be putting the matter too mildly after politico reported that clinton ally david brock demanded that the year old sander release his medical record the feel the bern twitterverse exploded in indignation desperate hypocrite outrageous et cetera the sander team who are turning out to be pretty crafty capitalist for a group toiling away for a socialist immediately went out and raised money off the fracas brock went up on twitter to say that a number of the assertion in the politico article were wrong'that he and his pro clinton super pac are not for example planning on running any attack ad john podesta who is with the clinton campaign tweeted at brock to 'chill out indicating that brock wa not acting on order from the campaign but wa freelancing on this one and sander 's spokesman say the campaign will release the record before anyone vote a it ha always planned to berniebros grow up first of all it 's a legitimate issue the man would be year old when elected and sworn in which would make him the oldest president ever elected the current holder of that record is ronald reagan who wa clinton would also be so she 's up there too donald trump incidentally would be he 's month clinton 's senior but anyone who 's ever watched their parent age know that is different my dear mom wa still playing a little tennis at at that wa out of the question and there were day that she wa in such excruciating back pain that she could barely sit up that to window is often an unforgiving one on the body and if sander were elected and served two term he 'd be in his last year in office brain deteriorate too when mom wa i still valued her counsel and insight but i 'm not sure i 'd have wanted her to be the president now for all i know sander ha the mind and body of a year old great for him if he doe but surely his health is a fair question and surely his advanced age make it a more relevant question than it would be in the case of ted cruz and marco rubio clinton released her record last summer i get that brock 's a lightning rod but it 's a fair question but the more important thing is this sander partisan ca n't insist that their guy is a serious candidate and then start whining when'he get treated like a serious candidate he 's doing a well a he is in the poll in the first instance because he 's clearly tapped into something that is resonating with a lot of people much of what he say resonates with me i 'd certainly proclaim medicare for all if i could wave a wand he 's a skilled politician he 's struck a chord and the clinton camp and the whole political class underestimated him however there 's been another reason he 's been polling well until just recently and on a small number of matter sander ha never been attacked he get no negative press to speak of he could get negative press i mean to be frank that he 's earned some on foreign policy question for example in one of the debate he wa a i wrote le than honest about the extent to which he 's supported barack obama 's position on syria okay i guess that count a bad press but i 'm not the front page of the new york time i do n't recall seeing much scrutiny there and in the other major outlet and let 's be honest if clinton had said in a debate that she 'd backed obama on matter she did n't it would 've been a story and maybe a big story but the medium have n't been interested in sander dirt or criticism the reason are fairly mundane and obvious he 's a good story the political press doe n't like clinton so anything that give her agita is great the political press also want a competitive race because it 's more interesting and their story will get more traffic and so on it 's all fine but if i were an intense sander partisan i would n't be fooling myself about this reality but that 's exactly what i hear when i hear sander people brag about how he 's doing better in some poll in head to head match ups against the republican contender than clinton is of course he 's doing better'the republican have n't spent a dime attacking him yet say what you will about clinton if you combine her and her husband 's various election campaign with ken starr 's prosecution effort they 've probably spent a couple hundred million dollar going after her yes a couple hundred million starr alone spent nearly million and remember that hillary wa every inch a much in his gun sight a bill wa and in this cycle she had three month of relentlessly negative press over her email some of that she brought on herself but some of it wildly irresponsible and false like the not one but two major time story that suggested she broke a law that did n't exist yet and that she wa the target of a criminal fbi probe she wa not and still is not a far a we know despite what many people think and say it 's a presidential race it 's going to get tough even in the primary phase just remember the clinton obama contest or the way newt gingrich and some of the other republican tore into mitt romney you have to be able to take punch major part of the audition clinton know this very well since she 's taken them for year it 's water he 's going to have to get used to sooner or later,11953.0

menorah swastika spray painted on jewish student center a jewish student punched in the face and a yikyak message posted at the university of chicago that sneered 'gas them burn them and dismantle their power structure humanity can not progress with the parasitic jew in an age of zero tolerance for subtle microaggressions these macroaggressions should be generating widespread outrage'rather than being ignored or even excused sometimes to resist this scourge jew and non jew alike should learn about american ' historic and unending disgust for anti semitism a characteristic but forgotten moment occurred in when a republican rival tried expelling the federalist jacob henry pdf from north carolina 's state legislature'because henry wa a jew hugh mill of rockingham county had a strong case even though henry had already served a year and wa an influential merchant politician who owned acre and a town lot in beaufort the grandson of a german rabbi henry wa a proud practicing jew and north carolina 's constitution clearly said 'no person who shall deny the being of god or the truth of the protestant religion or the divine authority either of the old or new testament ' shall be capable of holding any office or place of trust or profit in the civil department within this state mill said henry 's legislative seat wa 'contrary to the freedom and independence of our happy and beloved government henry counterattacked on dec eloquently deploying the reason of the enlightenment the passion of the revolution the egalitarianism of the declaration of independence and the guaranteed freedom of the north carolina declaration of right and the federal constitution itself in a magnificent speech that would be reprinted in patriotic primer for decade thereafter with schoolkids north and south forced to memorize it henry the son of immigrant taught his opponent americanism henry who had been up all night preparing wa rattled he started by apologizing saying 'i must confess that the resolution against me wa quite unexpected analyzing section of the state declaration echoing the first amendment henry emphasized america 's guarantee of religious liberty 'all

acknowledged that human reason and faith can arrive reasonably at different conclusion henry refused to judge others ' theology 'who among u feel himself so exalted above his fellow a to have a right to dictate to them their mode of belief he thundered in his era 's male centered rhetoric henry called such pronouncement 'a question between a man and his maker because it 'requires more than human attribute to pronounce which of the numerous sect prevailing in the world is most acceptible sic to the deity moreover henry insisted democratic 'governments only concern the action and conduct of man and not his speculative notion he insisted 'if a man fulfills the duty of that religion which his education and conscience have convinced him is the true one no person ' in this our land of liberty ha a right to prosecute him or make him 'suffer civil disqualification this notion of judging what we do not what we believe protects our freedom and encourages diversity in thought at this point two third of the way through the speech henry had defended the notion of freedom of worship and conscience generally but this proud american this courageous american jew embraced his religion refusing to cower behind generic freedom for all rather than specific freedom for him and his faith 'the religion i profess ' he said 'enjoins upon it votary the practice of every virtue and the detestation of every vice and then articulating tradition 's cradle to grave nurturing he said 'this then ' is my creed it wa impressed upon my infant mind it ha been the director of my youth the monitor of my

more than the time that 's passed since the landmark legislation of the mid th century nevertheless we should not despair for history show that a long a there ha been racism there ha been resistance to the idea though only recently attracting scholarly attention interracialism'defined briefly a companionship collaboration and cooperation across racial lines'is a much a part of american history a is racial division and strife even when and where you would least expect to find interracial friendship and alliance they have always existed take pensacola florida during the civil war in term of politics culture and geography it 's a city more deep south than south florida resembling mobile and montgomery a opposed to miami given this you might not expect to discover the widespread resistance to slavery and white supremacy in the far west florida panhandle during the heyday of secessionism and the rise of the confederate state of america but there wa though little known today the civil war almost started in pensacola when the newly elected president abraham lincoln ordered men and supply to reinforce fort pickens a massive hexagonal brick citadel on the opposite side of pensacola bay lincoln wanted to provoke confederate into firing the first shot of the war at fort pickens'because of it defensibility that plan failed when army leader ignored the commander in chief 's order and handed pensacola and the adjacent navy yard to the confederacy without a fight despite the setback union force managed to hold fort pickens for the duration of the war a the largest federally controlled fortification in the deep south it became a beacon of freedom attracting hundred of fugitive slave it wa in the word of one soldier stationed there 'the point to which the negro fled after the outbreak of the war from all surrounding district a it wa for some time the only point in the extreme south which wa held by federal troop and where they could be safe a look at two separate incident involving fugitive slave who tried to reach fort pickens and instead ended up facing a confederate court martial prof the existence of interracialism at a time and place considered entirely hostile to the practice the first involved five enslaved laborer claimed by jackson morton a florida state senator and one of the most powerful men in region the men peter william robert george and stephen claimed they were well treated by morton but when he threatened to move them to alabama they stole several boat docked near morton 's plantation and began the dangerous journey down the blackwater river toward fort pickens when they were arrested by confederate sentinel several day later the slave took full responsibility for the escape attempt openly avowing their desire to be free nevertheless they admitted that several white men helped convince them to abscond according to confederate court record the southern race traitor included mayo a well known grog shop owner in a small industrial village north of pensacola chance a contractor who worked for morton near mayo 's shop and garrett a lumber trader who plied the nearby water for more than a year each of these free white southerner risked their life and livelihood by encouraging their enslaved black associate to run away proclaiming that because of lincoln 's election they were a free a white men 'and that they were fool if they did not go to pickens a it wa easily done in the second incident a bondsman from pensacola named ebenezer made his way to fort pickens carrying newspaper and other material considered 'useful to the united state troop stationed there and injurious to the southern confederacy after being apprehended and taken aboard a confederate steamship the 'intelligent being likewise admitted to having several white accomplice lockly a mysterious man with a reputation for befriending his black neighbor provided the boat on which ebenezer tried to escape and even sailed with him part of the way to fort pickens before being 'knocked overboard by the boom melmore wa also notorious in pensacola a he wa 'the habitual associate of negroes'and place himself upon equality with them when ebenezer began plotting his escape to fort pickens he asked the 'irishman if there wa truth to ebenezer 's owner 's claim that the 'yankees at fort pickens treated fugitive slave severely melmore told ebenezer that everything his owner told him 'was a damned lie'that if he went over to the yankee he would be so well treated that they would give him work and pay for it and send him to new york or liberia in the end the confederate court martial found each of the runaway guilty on all charge but before official could carry out the punishment which ranged from hundred of lash to death by hanging confederate troop evacuated pensacola returning the city and surrounding area to the union with the exception of garrett whom the court acquitted of unknown charge the fate of 'the traitorous people with white skin who encouraged and assisted these and countless other runaway to fort pickens is unknown still before leaving pensacola a high ranking confederate commander warned 'those monster and vile wretch in the shape of white men of the danger they faced should they ever betray their race again further evidence of interracialism surviving in the antebellum and confederate south come from the last two year of the war when union occupied pensacola served a a base for thousand of black and white soldier and refugee among them were james summerford and wade richardson two young white abolitionist who traveled from central alabama to enlist in the union army according to a memoir written year after the war summerford came from a family of 'strong abolitionist while richardson wa the son of a universalist preacher who 'extended his creed to include all men black and white good and bad in his scheme of universal redemption richardson 's uncle also an abolitionist nearly lost his life to an angry mob near tuskegee alabama following lincoln 's election when he refused to enlist in a confederate regiment because of his opposition to slavery and secession summerford and richardson nearly failed to reach pensacola a the entire region wa controlled by confederate yet they managed to avoid detection with the assistance of black slave who readily volunteered information on the movement of confederate troop along 'with a bit of bread or a roasted potato or ear of corn when the two finally reached their destination both fell victim to yellow fever summerford succumbed to the disease within day but richardson managed to survive thanks to the selflessness of a 'colored nurse 'the woman 's treatment wa heroic i assure you richardson recalled 'but thanks to her i survived after recovering richardson enlisted in the first florida cavalry a union regiment consisting almost entirely of white southerner who spent much of the remainder of the war freeing hundred of slave along the gulf coast civil war pensacola reminds u that history is an important teacher while large number of american citizen have found white supremacy an attractive ideology worth fighting and even killing for it is just a important to remember that the dream of racial equality ha also always attracted a wide following'even when and where believing such an idea came at great cost a we

there wa 'newly discovered evidence of wrongdoing 'presented within a reasonable time ' carter ha publicly sought to distance himself from the controversy saying during a trip to europe last week that he had n't yet reached a conclusion defense official said that the decision to demote petraeus rest solely with the secretary 'my guess is the lawyer are carefully reviewing this one official told the daily beast mccain ha long been a diehard supporter of petraeus he ha called him one of america 's 'greatest general so his defense now is not surprising but the senator may also have mounted an effective legal argument against demoting petraeus one that the retired general himself could use one need n't even look to administrative law a mccain did the army 's own regulation state that a rank determination can be re opened after an officer ha left military service 'if substantial new evidence discovered contemporaneously with or within a short time following separation could result in a lower grade determination in other word the pentagon may have waited too long to try to demote petraeus petraeus committed his offense in while he wa still in uniform but his action were n't discovered until more than a year after he left military service and legal expert said petraeus had good reason to believe that when he reached a plea agreement with federal prosecutor in the matter of demotion wa behind him a judge fined petraeus and gave him two year probation 'no reasonable observer would consider this four plus year period a a short time eugene fidell who teach military justice at yale law school told the daily beast 'the regulation bind the government and a i read it it 's too late to reopen gen petraeus 's rank determination another military law expert reached a similar conclusion 'reopening a matter that ha already been settled'and decided in general petraeus ' favor'sends a harmful signal throughout the rank of senior uniformed leader butch bracknell a retired marine officer and military legal adviser wrote on lawfare bracknell suggested that in light of petraeus ' long record of otherwise unblemished service carter should consider 'giving the man a break 'certainly there need to be accountability for serious misconduct at all rank of military service bracknell argued 'but the unintended message of this ex post facto reduction in grade would be to tell junior general and colonel that no matter how well you serve no matter how much you sacrifice in service to our nation there is always peril that senior civilian leader will throw you under a bus for even a minor indiscretion'and that jeopardy never end some of petraeus ' fellow soldier are n't so sure a number of officer still in uniform privately told the daily beast that drudging up the case so many year after the fact wa gratuitous especially for a commander who arguably wa one of his generation 's best wartime commander many credit petraeus 's leadership in iraq in and with stemming year of increasingly sectarian violence eventually routing the precursor to isi others officer particularly lower ranking one said that the defense department must treat petraeus like any other officer many said they know of comrade whose career ended over far le serious infraction than sharing highly classified information with a civilian 'i would have been kicked out of the army for that one officer told the daily beast others said that if they had shared classified information they would certainly lose rank the rule they argued should apply throughout the chain of command pentagon official said that while they understand mccain 's concern they are legally allowed to review petraeus 's four star standing 'it 's certainly a reasonable line of questioning one defense said

the red carpet when special guest arrive the other is selective memory this is a country of course where even benito mussolini is oft remembered for the supposed 'good he did like getting the train to run on time and so it wa on monday when iranian president hassan rouhani came to rome with his mostly male entourage of six minister and businessmen to a welcome befitting a king and his court no one minded that his private airbus wa minute late since rouhani'after so many year of sanctions'is suddenly repping a mountain of money just unfrozen by the nuclear agreement he wa bringing with him the promise of billion in business deal that were clearly worth the wait rouhani 's english language twitter account announced his arrival 'landed in rome looking forward to deepening bilateral tie exploring opportunity for constructiveengagement rouhani then stormed through the eternal city with an impressive motorcade of armored car and eight motorcycles'considerably larger than that of u s president barack obama when he visited the city in rouhani began his official state visit with a working brunch with italian president sergio mattarella at the presidential palace where he wa honored by italy 's elite force in their formal attire mattarella wa flanked by italy 's finance and foreign minister rouhani brought his foreign minister along with his minister of oil and industry 'italy is our door to europe iran 's ambassador to italy jahanbakhsh mozaffari said ahead of rouhani 's visit it is clear italian see it more like a yellow brick road lined with persian gold before american led economic sanction italy wa iran 's largest trading partner in europe and it is clear that the country want iran 's business back among the deal on the table that rouhani 's men are expected to sign during the official visit are a deal with billion with oil pipeline company saipem a billion deal with steel company danieli and a lucrative deal with fiat chrysler there are smaller agreement in the work too like those with infrastructure company gavio and ship builder fincantieri the list go on of course any future collaboration with iran doe come at a price israel 's ambassador to rome naor gilon warned that any business deal should be forged with a clear understanding between rome and rouhani that iran must respect certain 'values and 'boundaries a part of these collaboration especially on the eve of the day of memory of the holocaust on january 'iran ha a long history of negationism holocaust denial and each year during these day it organizes a competition to ridicule the holocaust gilon told ansa news 'i find difficult to think that the italian authority ca n't find a way to express their disapproval amnesty international 's italian president gianni ruffini also asked renzi to raise concern about iran 's widespread use of the death penalty 'especially the thousand of execution carried out in before signing any accord in a joint press conference between the two leader on monday night renzi brushed over the controversy insisting the two had discussed more than just their mutually gratifying business arrangement he assured the press that they would work together against isi and that 'even in the area where we have pronounced difference such a human right we have demonstrated the ability to carry out dialogue and discussion rouhani for his part did n't seem blink an eye 'we iranian feel very much at home in italy rouhani said 'our journey in europe began in italy because we have an ancient friendship we can work together in every sector after business wa finished the iranian entourage joined renzi and business men and woman for a gala dinner held in the opulent caffarelli palace on the capitoline hill overlooking the ancient roman forum where the italian delegation agreed to forego serving wine at the dinner at the request of the iranian on tuesday rouhani will lead a joint italian iranian business forum before dashing off to vatican city for a private audience with pope francis during which the two are expected to discus peace poverty and human right no doubt rouhani will also express his gratitude to the pontiff for his intervention last fall when he urged congress not to sabotage the accord during it most delicate stage because the audience is private it seems unlikely the true content of their discourse will be made public then rouhani will meet with parliamentarian and business group before jetting off to paris where he is expected to continue the spending spree with the acquisition of new aircraft from airbus and a lucrative deal with french carmaker peugeot rouhani will not however be hosted at any formal meal on his french leg since the french apparently are n't a willing to give up their wine a the italian and a such the iranian delegation ha reportedly refused to attend any state dinner where wine is served he will instead meet with a group of iranian expat in paris for a private dinner on monday a

822,10062844.0,2016-01-19T05:01:00+00:00,the cia 's syria program and the peril of proxy,almost every aspect of the obama administration 's policy toward syria ha been scrutinized lambasted or praised in recent month but one of the most significant facet the cia 's covert aid program to syrian rebel ha largely slipped below the radar it is time that we start paying attention since this initiative is benefiting the very jihadist group the u s ha been fighting for the past year america 's abrupt about face is a mistake but even those who would defend this new course a the least bad option should favor a more robust public debate the cia 's program launched in initially wa conceived a a way of strengthening moderate rebel fighting bashar al assad 's regime without significantly increasing the u s footprint in the conflict the program got off to a slow start with rebel commander grumbling that the cia wa stingy due to it concern that weapon would fall into extremist ' hand a a result moderate rebel were forced at time to ration ammunition at least one rebel group severed it tie with the cia and joined an islamist led coalition while other cia backed rebel stopped fighting after these early hiccup the program evolved anonymous u s official now tell the medium that cia backed rebel have begun recently to experience unprecedented success particularly in northwestern syria yet these gain reveal a darker side to the cia backed group ' victory and even american official ' framing of these advance provides reason for concern a the associated press reported in october official have explained that the cia backed group were capturing new territory by 'fighting alongside more extremist faction who are these extremist co belligerent analysis of the geography of 'moderate rebel ' gain during this period and report from the battlefield demonstrate that cia backed group collaborated with jaysh al fateh an islamist coalition in which jabhat al nusra'al qaeda 's official syrian affiliate'is a leading player hassan hassan co author with the daily beast 's michael wei of isi inside the army of terror suggested that rebel gain in idlib in april showcased the symmetry between cia backed force and nusra when he attributed the rebel ' success to suicide bomber frequently deployed by nusra and other jihadist and 'american anti tank tow missile in southern syria the cia backed southern front fought alongside nusra in the campaign to take the city of deraa in june cia backed group in northwestern syria publicly acknowledge their relationship with the al qaeda affiliate a commander of fursan ul haq a rebel group that received tow missile through cia channel explained that 'there is something misunderstood by world power we have to work with nusra front and other group to fight both assad 's regime and the islamic state similarly a spokesman for cia backed suqour al ghab justified his group 's collaboration with nusra by noting that 'we work with all faction when there are attack on the regime either through direct cooperation or just coordinating the movement of troop so we do n't fire at each other the fact that cia backed group collaborate with nusra doe not necessarily prove that they harbor jihadist sympathy nor that they hoodwinked the american official who vetted them in many or perhaps most case these group ' decision to cooperate with nusra is born out of pragmatism when fighting a regime a brutal a assad 's it is natural to look for ally wherever they may be found further a one of the dominant player in northern syria nusra can dictate term to smaller rebel faction the experience of harakat hazm and the syrian revolutionary front two cia backed group that nusra literally obliterated in late are a stark warning jamaal maarouf the commander of the syrian revolutionary front explained after his group wa ousted from syria that no militia in the rebel umbrella organization known a the free syrian army can operate in northern syria 'without nusra 's approval because of nusra 's strength cia backed faction have entered what ha been called a 'marriage of necessity with the jihadist group which is exploiting it position to gain access to american weapon after rebel seized a syrian military base in idlib province in december cia backed group admitted that they had been forced to use u s provided tow missile to support the nusra led offensive one rebel explained that nusra had allowed cia backed group to retain physical control of the missile so a to maintain the veneer of autonomy thus allowing them to sustain their relationship with the cia in short nusra ha at time gamed the system but such subterfuge notwithstanding at this point it is impossible to argue that u s official involved in the cia 's program can not discern that nusra and other extremist have benefited and despite this the cia decided to drastically increase lethal support to vetted rebel faction following the russian intervention into syria in late september rebel who previously complained about the cia 's tight fistedness suddenly found the floodgate open particularly with respect to tow missile one rebel explained 'we can get a much a we need and whenever we need them just fill in the number report suggest that the obama administration and sunni state backing the opposition have also discussed though not committed to providing shoulder fired anti aircraft weapon to vetted group with the cia doubling down on it support for syrian rebel it is now more important than ever to have a candid and vigorous public debate about the agency 's program put simply such an about face in u s policy'backing group that help al qaeda to make advance after spending a decade and a half fighting the jihadist group'should not occur without a public debate that help american understand why such drastic change in u s policy have occurred several prominent figure have defended this program for instance robert ford the former u s ambassador to syria argued that by maintaining the supply of lethal support to moderate rebel the cia may ultimately be able to build up these faction a a viable alternative to nusra the islamic state and assad but the program 's cost outweigh it possible benefit though aiding al qaeda 's advance is not the program 's intention it is the effect thus after fighting al qaeda and it affiliate for a decade and a half the cia is now helping them gain ground in syria at the moment al qaeda is trying to rebrand itself by contrasting it approach to that of the far more brutal islamic state ' and unfortunately it ha experienced some success due to it jihadist competitor 's excess and the escalating conflict between iran and saudi arabia al qaeda ha portrayed itself to sunni state and the muslim public a a bulwark against both the islamic state 's growth and iranian encroachment if u s backed rebel are cooperating with al qaeda the united state will be hard pressed to stop al qaeda from gaining more room to operate in the region it is unlikely that the united state with no meaningful presence in syria understands the situation on the ground better than al qaeda and can strategically outmaneuver the jihadist group the danger is too great that continuation of this policy will empower nusra further eventually forcing policymakers to confront a greatly emboldened al qaeda force in syria this is why at the very least we should have a robust public discussion about whether to continue this course in syria ' a debate that the u s congress is well positioned to kickstart through public hearing on the cia 's program allowing this program to continue without carefully thinking through the benefit cost and possible unintended consequence is incredibly risky and could erode public trust and support,12128.0

on an anti immigration platform is not the rising talent they once worked with on the george w bush campaign in the bush administration and then a texas solicitor general the ted cruz of those year wa a whip smart and audaciously ambitious lawyer who lent his considerable intellectual heft to the policy many latino republican cared most about including immigration reform but during a cnn debate in december a cruz and sen marco rubio clashed over cruz 's past position on offering legal status to undocumented immigrant cruz said definitively 'i 've never supported legalization i do not intend to support it week later cruz doubled down explaining to fox news ' bret baier that he tried to amend to the senate 's 'gang of eight comprehensive immigration reform bill not to pas it but to doom it to defeat 'bret you 've been around washington long enough you know how to defeat bad legislation and with that cruz 's bridge back to his former colleague in latino republican circle began to burn 'it 's just a flat out lie period said robert de posada 'there 's just no truth behind it de posada is a former director of hispanic affair for the rnc and founder of the latino coalition a conservative latino organization that worked with the bush administration unsuccessfully to pas immigration reform 'my criticism is that cruz can say 'things have changed and i 've changed my position ' but do n't sit here and flat out lie that you have never been for legalization when the fact are very clear the fact according to de posada and several republican who worked with cruz in washington and texas are that in cruz 's past work for bush and later a a board member of the washington based hispanic alliance for prosperity institute cruz helped craft policy to allow undocumented immigrant to stay in the country and pursue legal status none of those effort included granting automatic amnesty to undocumented worker but it is clear in the mind of his former colleague that finding a way to offer immigrant a way to remain in the united state and gain legal status wa central to the work cruz did a former bush administration official who worked with cruz during the campaign and later a a part of an interdepartmental white house working group on immigration remembered cruz a an aggressive member of the team tasked with creating a framework to pas bush 's pro immigration agenda the position cruz hold today wa not in play in those year the official said in sometimes deeply personal term 'how do you say hypocrite in spanish do you know it 's ted cruz the former official said 'to know ted is to hate ted the official described cruz 's role on the bush immigration agenda a working a a liaison between the office of public liaison and the white house 's policy shop 'he wanted to bring immigrant out of the shadow the official said 'that 's changed since the campaign and changed since the white house day but of course it ha if it suit ted he 's for it if it doe n't he 's against it 'it 's a disappointment the official said who like many of the people interviewed for this piece referenced cruz 's natural intelligence 'i think ted could do a lot of good if he had a soul but before the white house cruz worked in texas a a policy adviser for the bush presidential campaign including on bush 's plan for immigration reform when charles foster a prominent houston immigration lawyer wa tapped to draft bush 's plan he said he wa told the campaign had a team of bright young lawyer to work with him 'one of them named ted cruz had in his bailiwick of issue immigration and he would be my contact with the campaign foster said together foster and cruz worked for nine month drafting what would become the immigration principle of the bush campaign and eventually the white house the plan would not include amnesty like ronald reagan 's blanket legalization program which immediately put undocumented immigrant in line for citizenship but bush would push for a path to legal status an aggressive temporary worker program and a requirement that undocumented worker who stayed in the united state would go to the back of the line for citizenship foster remembers cruz a a 'very hand on professional who never raised objection to the policy 'i assumed ted wa supportive of gov bush 's position but i honestly ca n't remember asking ted if he agreed with the position and personally supported it i assume he did but we were like lawyer representing the interest of our client after the campaign and two year in the bush administration cruz moved home to texas to become the state 's solicitor general in once in texas he joined the board of adviser for hapi the prestigious group of latino conservative that included george p bush former member of congress and multiple veteran of the reagan george h w bush and george w bush administration while cruz wa a member of the board and it policy committee hapi advocated conservative position to an array of issue including it opposition to both climate change legislation and the affordable care act on immigration hapi strongly advocated for a path to legalization including president bush 's principle for immigration reform a well a the mccain kennedy immigration reform bill 'it 's just bullshit said a former member of the hapi when asked about cruz 's contention that he never supported legalization 'that 's what piss u all off do n't throw u under the bus for legalization and not take on the nativist and the crazy when you wrote the language stand for something the former hapi board member who asked not to be named in order to speak freely described cruz a a fully engaged member of the group cruz co chaired a event featuring gov rick perry and served a a keynote speaker for two of the group 's event between and and because of cruz 's legal expertise board member said they relied on him to do the first draft of policy position including hapi 's support for immigration reform when he ran for senate in hapi hosted a fundraiser to support his candidacy in the campaign for senate cruz 's role at hapi became the subject of a bitter disagreement between cruz and david dewhurst then the lt gov of texas and cruz 's opponent in the senate primary race the dewhurst campaign accused cruz of 'leading two organization that support amnesty a position that neither hapi nor the other group ever supported but member of hapi 's board insist that legalization for undocumented immigrant wa always unequivocally a part of it platform hapi no longer exists today but cruz ha gone on to become it most famous and potentially most powerful former member an end to the story that many of his fellow latino republican lament 'when he went so far a to say he 's never been for legalizing that 's where he crossed the line and lost people like me said robert de posada 'it 's a character issue where a lot of u are just like 'um no ',31975.0

ingredient in quorn 's meatless selection a product called mycoprotein mycoprotein originates from a fungus in the uk a patented product it 's not only the main ingredient in quorn 's foods'it 's their entire business model the company ha survived multiple lawsuit in the past decade over it origin but this one which attack it advertising is decidedly different while food health expert go to bat for the lawsuit spokesman from quorn insist that the lawsuit have no merit will the million company beat the mold crusader once again kimberly birbower the plaintiff in the class action suit argues that mycoprotein is not a 'mushroom based protein a the company asserts but a 'fermented mold 'something customer deserve to know 'had quorn disclosed the truth'that it product are actually made of mold'plaintiff and consumer would not have purchased quorn 's product the complaint read birbower who first began buying the company 's product in say quorn 's claim that mycoprotein is 'the same or substantially similar to a mushroom truffle or morel is nonsense 'quorn 's representation is clearly designed to deceive consumer she say birbower 's lawsuit is a new approach to tackling quorn 's alleged mold driven product which others have done through lawsuit attempting to prove that it 's unsafe the history of mycoprotein date back to the in the s when it wa created by a uk scientist who feared a protein shortage wa imminent derived from a fungus called fusarium venenatum it wa eventually grown in large fermentation tank the product wa approved for human consumption in and named for quorn a village in leicester after enjoying success in ireland and the uk it wa released in the united state in not long after health expert began expressing concerns'many of them based on the fact it health effect were largely unknown in america it wa approved by the federal drug administration with what 's called a gras notification'something that more or le qualifies it a safe for 'general food use le than a year later michael jacobson the executive director of the center for science in the public interest filed a petition asking that the fda to reconsider the term of this jacobson argued that quorn should have to clarify the origin of mycoprotein on the package'changing it from 'mushroom in origin to 'fungus his concern wa fueled by report that people had responded negatively to the fungus which the fda had not reviewed specifically he pointed to a study from in which percent of the subject who consumed quorn became ill with 'nausea vomiting and stomach ache when the fda denied his petition jacobson created a website for consumer to report adverse reaction today it house more than example one is that of kathy cardinale a year old advertising executive who say that she became 'violently ill after eating quorn 's chicken patty i felt like the sol of my foot were going to come out of my mouth i wa vomiting so hard she said once i began to research quorn online i realized i wa n't alone'it wa unbelievable to me that the company knew this wa going on and wa n't warning consumer while most reaction seem to involve nausea and vomiting a few report allege that the consumption of mycoprotein in quorn 's product turned fatal last march the parent of an year old boy sued quorn claiming that an allergy to the fungus which they were n't aware the product contained led to their son ' death quorn for it part ha vigorously denied the accusation saying that the intolerance rate of mycoprotein are far below that of wheat and soy in the case of the year old boy they point to the final coroner 's report which found that he succumbed to an asthma attack in a lengthy statement to the daily beast quorn 'vehemently denied the claim made in the california lawsuit 'we take great care to meticulously list the ingredient in each of our meat alternative product this is why our packaging contains some of the most descriptive language of any food product on the market today a spokesperson wrote quorn said that the company is not only 'fully compliant with fda regulation but that it 'exceeds the agency 's standard by offering up additional information after successfully delivery three billion meal in country the company say it 's standing behind it 's 'nutritious great tasting food that are safe to eat and sustainable to our environment 'we regret that m birbrower claim to have been unhappy with her purchase but we will continue to stand behind our product and intend to strongly defend the company against these misguided assertion the spokesman said in closing despite the denial that their product are dangerous the company added a warning label in cautioning consumer about 'rare adverse reaction the note describes mycoprotein a 'a member of the fungi mold family 'the exact language birbower take issue with beyond inaccurate she claim this information is 'intentionally buried on the box so that it 'would not be read by ordinary consumer jacobson and the rest of his team at cspi stand by their original theory that mycoprotein is unsafe in an article from the center quoted a cornell university mycologist who painted an interesting picture of quorn 's claim that mycoprotein is 'mushroom based saying 'mushrooms are a distantly related to quorn 's fungus a human are to jellyfish,8763.0

1214,10315196.0,2016-01-26T23:55:00+00:00,iran 's mysterious american prisoner claimed he wa an fbi informant ooops,in news photo showing the four american released from prison in iran earlier this month one man appears only a a silhouette nosratollah khosravi roodsari there is no known photograph of him and that name doe n't show up in several public record search khosravi himself doe n't appear to have a social medium account he is a close to anonymous a one can be today but based on interview with current and former official who know some of the detail of khosravi 's case a picture is emerging of the mysterious fourth man and not a flattering one khosravi who ha been described a a businessman specializing in the design and sale of carpet and rug may also have been an ambitious huckster with an overeager imagination and a penchant for telling wild stories'tales that landed him in an iranian jail while visiting family in iran last year khosravi who ha iranian and u s citizenship claimed that he wa working for the fbi and that he had information on the whereabouts of robert levinson a retired fbi agent and contractor for the central intelligence agency who wa kidnapped in iran in and ha n't been found it wa wild claim especially since he had no such information the three other american who were freed along with khosravi including washington post reporter jason rezaian had all been accused of working with american intelligence or trying to subvert iran 's national security and all three firmly denied the allegation but here wa khosravi not only telling various people in iran he wa an agent of the united state but that he had information about levinson who ha been the subject of intense negotiation between u s and iranian official for year khosravi wa taken into custody last year and questioned about his supposed connection to the fbi and levinson how the iranian became aware of his astonishing claim is unclear but two u s official told the daily beast that this much is certain khosravi wa making it all up 'he never worked for the fbi in any capacity one official told the daily beast speaking on condition of anonymity when discussing khosravi 's very sensitive case he wa n't a consultant an adviser nor an employee official do n't deny khosravi appears to have been peddling his story in iran but they insist it wa n't true the fbi came to that conclusion that khosravi knew nothing about levinson after khosravi himself called the bureau sometime before he left for iran and claimed to have information on the missing american fbi official interviewed him and found khosravi 's claim were n't credible the official said suzanne halpin levinson 's sister in law and a spokesperson for the family told the daily beast that they 'd never heard of khosravi until his release from iran nor were they aware of him ever saying he had information about levinson why khosravi chose to pas himself off a working for the fbi is still a mystery the iranian might have marveled at their own good luck in snaring a potential american agent but they do n't seem to have believed khosravi 's story either nine month ago u s official first learned that khosravi wa in iranian custody when they were 'alerted to his presence by iranian authority another u s official told the daily beast at the time obama administration official and their iranian counterpart were already five month into secretive negotiation aimed at freeing the other three american captive in a prisoner swap with iran khosravi wa added to the mix but still never publicly identified by either side that wa the opposite of iran 's behavior in the case of the three other american prisoner the post 's rezaian former u s marine amir hekmati and christian pastor saeed abedini iranian official trumpeted their arrest and made baseless accusation of espionage their case were also reported in official medium but khosravi 's name never appeared in print in iran and there is no record of him ever having been charged or tried it wa a if the iranian were more interested in getting rid of him than exploiting him some detail about khosravi 's case emerged last weekend when iranwire a publication run by former iranian prisoner maziar bahari ran a story about khosravi 's alleged fbi connection the detail were attributed to khosravi 's former cellmate in iran 's evin prison and an unnamed family member but the publication wa unable to reach khosravi himself current and former official said it wa possible that khosravi told his cellmate or family member and friend that he worked for the fbi but that doe n't make it true iranwire which partner with the daily beast reported that during a night out drinking with friend in iran khosravi texted an fbi contact he had met in the united state either in florida or california who had been looking into iranian involvement with car theft ring khosravi said in the sm that he knew levinson 's whereabouts iranian security intercepted the text and picked khosravi up for questioning a a result but he claimed that he 'd been lying to impress his fbi contact and wa under the influence of alcohol when he sent the text iranwire reported the u s official who said that the fbi had previously interviewed khosravi said that he took the business card of one agent the official did not know if khosravi ever tried to contact the agent the daily beast wa unable to reach khosravi to hear his side of his improbable tale his whereabouts are unknown but a u s official said that he ha left iran after the prisoner were released from jail khosravi turned down a seat on a swiss aircraft on january that ferried the three other american prisoner to europe they are now all back in the united state an american student whose case wa unconnected to the prisoner swap and who had been held in iran for day also wa freed khosravi 's mother and other family member live in iran he may have gone to stay with them before finally leaving where he go next is another mystery,43614.0

then all hell break loose investor start to stampede for the exit and count themselves lucky if they can get out with the shirt on their back the next big bubble to burst an increasing number of informed voice are saying is london 's 'super prime ' property market that is apartment worth over m which are often housed in gleaming new apartment block that model themselves on five star hotel complete with 'amenities ' such a wine cellar a concierge room service screening room dry cleaning serviced laundry house keeping squash court and swimming pool large number of these five star apartments'along with countless other grand stucco fronted town house in the best part of kensington and chelsea'have been bought by billionaire foreign owner who rather than live in them simply use the property a secure dump and some say washing machine for money that they would rather not leave in a bank back home in greece kazakhstan or qatar these 'buy to leave ' a pun on the traditional british property investment model of buy to let or rent property owner have created residential wasteland in some of london 's poshest neighborhood after dark in the picturesque street and coveted square around the king road kensington high street and even notting hill it 's like a ghost town these day there are very few light on in the window of marquee building like one hyde park and the knightsbridge nobody 's home'except perhaps the staff any family member actually staying in the house or flat are likely to be student it is estimated that billion worth of residential london property is unused and 'economically inert ' and the reality is that wealthy british family do n't want to live in kensington and chelsea any more they do n't feel like they belong there they have moved out to battersea hammersmith acton and shoreditch a new report issued this week by london realtor kay co a high end london estate agent claimed that there are now some of these luxury apartment of which they say are ' star rated '' meaning the building provides a concierge garden a gym or spa a cinema a wine cellar and a swimming pool'located across eight central london district price paid for new build apartment in prime central london pcl to use the business jargon have increased at an astonishing rate the average price of a five star apartment in pcl ha more than tripled from in to million today kay co say however all that might be about to change unsurprisingly developer are clamoring to build more of the luxurious tower block and they have found a friend in the mayor of london boris johnson who ha been broadly accepting of the buy to leave market and pushed several controversial high rise apartment development through london 's often torturous planning process the result is predictable a coming tidal wave of over supply roarie scarisbrick of property consultant property vision told the daily beast that an estimated apartment priced at more than million are coming to market in the next two year in pcl'but that just similarly priced unit were bought in 'volumes are way down he say 'we drilled down into the land registry data and we found that the volume of sale of property priced at m m were down property priced at m m were down and volume of property over m sold were down and wa in some way an atypical year because there wa a general election indeed some expert have argued that the threat of a so called mansion tax which dominated much of the electioneering in make a more valid year for comparison against which pcl sale volume are more than down according to another london real estate agency douglas newman good the mansion tax did n't happen a the right wing conservative party won the election but foreign investor have instead been spooked by a new property tax regime in the uk which ha seen a higher 'stamp duty ' tax now applied to property worth over 'and a rate slapped on house sold for over m there is also a massive disconnect in london now between the price of property and the price of shelter'or to put it another way the yield available to investor this is a classic warning sign of a bubble a it indicates that buyer are simply buying thing in the hope that the price someone else will be prepared to pay for their lovely tulip will continue to rise instead of really thinking about the fundamental astonishingly scarisbrick say some of the new flash apartment coming on stream in london in place like the redeveloped battersea power station could yield a return of a little a half a percent on the capital invested even for landlord accustomed to a return of that could be a little hard to stomach it 's easy enough to find dissenting voice in the london property market many agent will tell you that their foreign investor simply are not concerned about yield and that the chaos in the oil and commodity market while reducing the average oligarch 's net wealth will actually encourage yet more investment in the 'safe haven ' of london property maybe that 's so and the creator of singaporean and hong kong banking fortune will continue to merrily buy off plan for year to come but to the local listening perhaps a little more carefully the pcl market is staring to make something awfully like a hissing sound,10342.0

and a beautiful representative of the sikh faith he went into the belly of the beast'a trump rally 'wearing his traditional sikh turban and sporting a beard both considered article of faith to sikh singh is n't muslim in fact many sikh have been assaulted in recent year by bigot who thought they were muslim with over attack recorded since in the united state including murder but a singh explained to me 'social justice and defending people in need is part of the sikh faith you do n't have to be a muslim to stand against anti muslim bigotry everyone should stand up against bigotry and hate regardless of the target singh wa not only upset with trump 's demonizing of muslim but the fact that recently a muslim woman wearing a hijab wa ejected from a trump rally for simply standing up in silent protest singh felt compelled to do something and so singh set out sunday night to do just that singh who wa born and raised in iowa but who now split his time between the hawkeye state and chicago set out with his friend taylor williams to attend sunday 's trump rally they had written two simple word on a big white sheet 'stop hate singh planned to unfurl this sign if trump engaged in demonizing any minority group but with trump it 's not really a question of if but when so about minute into trump 's speech he began his recitation of how scary muslim were he painted a picture that muslims'even muslim americans'were all a potential threat who could at any moment shoot even their friend that is when singh yelled out 'why do you give shelter to white supremacist he then opened up the sheet within second security and a trump aide grabbed singh and began escorting him to the door trump can then be heard bellowing 'bye 'goodbye a the crowd cheered in unison 'trump trump trump while being physically removed from the venue singh feared that the angry chanting crowd could 'descend upon him at any moment it wa tense and once singh wa outside the auditorium and standing in the stairwell that 's when the angry white man threatened to beat him up unsurprisingly the threat wa directed only at singh not to his white friend williams who wa at that time the one holding the 'stop hate sign the local police then escorted singh and williams out of the venue where the police threatened to charge the two with 'inciting a riot you see interrupting trump could inspire violence a we saw a few month ago when trump 's white supporter beat up a black protester while calling the man a 'monkey and the n word and even worse trump publicly defended this assault on fox news so who know what trump supporter could do if they get even angrier or trump suggests they do something meanwhile back in the venue trump made a joke which seemed to be targeting singh 's religious turban trump commented to the crowd 'he wa n't wearing one of those hat wa he i know there 's a debate over whether trump wa mocking singh 's turban or not but given trump 's recent history of hateful comment directed at latino and muslim and his defending the assault of a black protester at this point it 's certainly fair to assume trump wa again mocking a minority to the delight of his white supporter i asked singh who is a writer and a comedian why he choose to yell out specifically about trump giving shelter to white supremacist singh explained that he wa greatly alarmed that white supremacist had openly been calling voter to support trump in iowa and that trump had failed to denounce these hate monger in those prerecorded phone message a well known white supremacist leader urged voter in iowa to support trump because trump understood that 'we need smart well educated white people who will assimilate to our culture and trump ha been a boon to white supremacist group which have seen a 'trump bump in membership because they are excited by his hateful campaign rhetoric directed at minority singh fear that trump 's word could do more than embolden haters'they could inspire violence he pointed to the latino immigrant beaten up in august by 'passionate trump supporter in boston a an example and singh expressed his concern that trump could foster a climate that could lead to more sikh being attacked or even killed such a in when a self proclaimed white supremacist shot and killed six sikh in a sikh temple located in oak creek wisconsin 'it 's scarier today for kid growing up who wear a turban or who look muslim than when i wa a kid singh noted he explained that even in chicago which is a diverse city just last week someone called him a 'terrorist while he wa walking along the sidewalk being physically thrown out of a venue while being mocked and threatened by angry trump supporter and ridiculed by trump may dissuade some but not singh he 's planning to do even more commenting that 'trump is emboldening right wing white supremacy and a response is needed even if that mean i 'm arrested for civil disobedience in calling it out it 's people like singh not trump who

institute told the daily beast al nimr 's death prompted protester to storm the saudi embassy in tehran which led to saudi arabia severing diplomatic tie with their persian rival mohammed bin nayef saudi arabia 's crown prince and interior minister and a close ally of washington oversaw the execution so it could n't have come a much of a surprise to the obama administration but the saudi had threatened to kill al nimr before accusing him of promoting iranian meddling in the country and had always backed down so why follow through now the decision come at a moment when the saudi have several reason to feel vulnerable to rising iranian influence'both in their country and across the region'and may not think the u s is doing enough to curb it it 's not just that iran ha approached more normal relation with europe and the united state following a landmark deal to curb iran 's nuclear weapon ambition in yemen saudi force are fighting iranian backed militant in what is frequently seen a a proxy war and in iraq and syria the iranian are also playing an important role in the u s led fight against isi iranian backed shiite militia have been a key fighting force in several key battle in iraq tehran ha forged an alliance with moscow that is likely to help shape the political future of syria and it embattled president bashar al assad the saudi see no good coming from the rise of iran a a regional power 'they 're in this very insecure period mccinnis said viewed through that lens the execution of al nimr after year of threat could be read a a 'demonstration of strength bruce riedel a former cia officer and middle east analyst at the brookings institution agreed that the execution of al nimr wa meant in part to send a signal to tehran 'i suspect they wanted an iranian reaction salman is a risk taker riedel said referring to the saudi king riedel noted that the saudi monarchy wa also making clear to it own citizen that it would n't tolerate any internal political dissent fomented by iran inciting a diplomatic rift also may play into riyadh 's long term strategy of undermining tehran 'saudi ha long opposed diplomatic initiatives'be it in syria or on the nuclear issue'that iran participated in and that risked normalizing iran 's regional role and influence trita parsi the president of the national iranian american council told the daily beast 'from the saudi perspective geopolitical trend in the region have gone against it interest for more than a decade now and the rise of iran'and the u s decision to negotiate and compromise with iran over it nuclear program'has only added to the saudi panic parsi noted that saudi arabia 's severing of diplomatic tie with iran give the monarchy 'the perfect excuse to slow down undermine and possibly completely scuttle u s led talk planned in geneva later this month aimed at reaching a political settlement in the syrian civil war saudi arabia ha been a reluctant partner in that effort and only joined after threatening a boycott if iran wa excluded parsi said another unanswered question is what if anything the obama administration may have done to deter the saudi from executing al nimr and setting off a regional crisis washington had n't made a strong public push to stop the execution and the state department ha n't condemned it despite the fact that some european country have done so on saturday state department spokesperson john kirby issued a statement that the united state wa 'particularly concerned that the execution of prominent shia cleric and political activist nimr al nimr risk exacerbating sectarian tension at a time when they urgently need to be reduced if washington tried more forcefully in private to get the saudi to change course that effort obviously failed the saudi may also have been playing to a domestic audience al nimr wa just one of men put to death a fact that ha been overshadowed in the dispute over al nimr nearly all of them were sunni jihadist including a group that had plotted to overthrow the monarchy on the order of osama bin laden 'this wa more for internal political reason it seems to me henri barkey the director of the middle east program at the wilson center told the daily beast killing al nimr provoked iran but it may also have placated supporter of those sunni jihadist who continue to pose a significant threat to internal security 'if the saudi were trying to distract domestic attention from them by sacrificing a few sh'ia including nimr they 've done a good job barkey said 'they are more worried about salafists jihadist at home than anything the iranian can throw at them,22652.0

from throwing themselves and their party into an abyss they could never climb out of in a cycle when the republican presidential field ha become mired in the nativist the trivial and the occasionally cruel ryan along with republican south carolina sen tim scott sat six presidential candidate down in columbia s c saturday to talk about the struggle of poor american and way to lift them people out of poverty twelve hour before the ryan event began in columbia donald trump had rallied further north in rock hill s c when a year old muslim woman stood silently behind trump in protest he stopped his event a security threw her out to the roar of the crowd you have a bomb you have a bomb one yelled according to cnn before the rally a trump staffer had instructed the crowd that protester would not be tolerated compare that to the forum in columbia where ryan and scott quizzed jeb bush marco rubio chris christie ben carson john kasich and mike huckabee about their idea to tackle persistent poverty when protester stood again and again to yell undocumented and unafraid at rubio ryan kept talking anyway eventually those protester were ejected too but the crowd remained entirely and deliberately civil unlike the fact free frenzy that the trump phenomenon ha become complete with policy proposal like we 'll have more of everything the ryan scott forum wa an attempt to focus on a critical issue without easy answer it will need democrat and republican alike to solve the problem the kind the ryan ha said he 'll make the focus of his agenda a speaker the event wa named after the late jack kemp ryan 's mentor who traveled extensively throughout inner city during his time in the house of representative to meet with people in poverty particular african american and push republican to produce policy that could give them a way out scott talked about growing up poor in south carolina ryan laid out the role he see for conservative in breaking the cycle of poverty incarceration addiction and untreated mental illness in this country the condition of your birth doe not determine your outcome in life ryan said but if it is not true for everybody then it really not true at all it 's a perspective some democrat approach with skepticism from ryan pointing to the federal budget blueprint ryan offered in a evidence that ryan is ready to gut medicare social security and crucial safety net program for the poorest american but bob woodson a longtime poverty and civil right activist said ryan 's approach to the issue is both genuine and evolving in october of ryan called woodson to ask a favor could he assemble a group of grassroots activist in ohio to talk to ryan about the war on poverty it wa an epiphany for him woodson said the two continued their travel after the election we went once a month every month for two year woodson said high crime low income neighborhood in the worst zip code in the country seeing drug addict being redeemed touching the arm of people on heroin kneeling down and praying with people in new orleans he learned first hand what the journey wa for them woodson said ryan followed up with card and note to the people he met and ha remained in touch with them a time passed woodson said he began to see a change in ryan he stopped talking about cutting budget and started talking about revising people 's behavior so that a a consequence it will reduce the cost of government but ryan 's epiphany is not his party 's while candidate like ben carson and marco rubio talk about their own family ' struggle frontrunner donald trump ha largely ignored the issue aside from offering his opinion that wage are too high whether ryan can bring his party along on his crusade with him is an open question particularly in a year when trump 's rabid populism and personal insult not civil conversation about poverty is the fuel for the fire with the gop base whether republican a a party can or even want to address the need of poor american is a pivotal question for many in the gop and one many believe will decide the long term viability of the party our leading candidate ha a percent disapproval rating with hispanic with a growth potential sen lindsey graham told the daily beast but i think paul ryan embracing jack kemp is a good thing the party of jack kemp need to reemerge you have to have a heart and a brain john lettieri the co founder of the economic innovation group a nonpartisan think tank that co sponsored the event said the forum had revealed two possible path for the gop there are leader within the party who are working aggressively to reframe the way voter consider republican when they think about the question that really cost mitt romney 'who care about people like you ' littieri said you have those people like ryan bush rubio kasich they are not going to give up their party without a fight although ryan won wide praise at the forum he 's already gotten call for a primary challenger from grassroots conservative who say he 's just another version of former house speaker john boehner a deal maker who many derided a insufficiently conservative but ohio gov john kasich who worked with ryan in the house predicted the new speaker would be able to work his way through the politics of the notoriously raucous caucus and help their party in the process there 's one good thing that happened with paul they begged him to become speaker so he can set his own term and that 's what he 's done kasich said he 's a policy guy and it 's hard for speaker to be totally policy oriented without understanding the politics of the caucus that will be his challenge and his frustration but he 'll manage it well,10160.0

thing feel good to you'that 's your nerve ending it 's not like gay men have magic nerve ending that make them enjoy prostate play not surprisingly there are no good statistic when it come to how many men engage in prostate stimulation during sex but glickman say at least anecdotally interest in the prostate for pleasure ha risen in recent year 'in the last three year i 've been getting more question about it and more acceptance of it when i teach workshop i used to get people the last workshop i did people showed up he said but resistance to the idea is just a strong 'which is too bad

tissue for those who skipped junior high sex ed the prostate is a walnut sized gland that sits right below a man 's bladder it 's main job is to make a vitamin and protein packed milkshake that can

veteran or not they the vendor should not be allowed to sell on this most important and prestigious shopping street trump declared he warned 'the image of new york city will suffer'i hope you can stop this very deplorable situation before it is too late the state legislature had originally accorded a special vendor 's license to disabled veteran in the aftermath of the civil war trump and other moneyed folk were not able to get the vendor banned but the authority did cap the total number of veteran with special license and restrict the number who could work on particular street at a given time peddler were largely banned from fifth avenue but they continued to sell their ware on the side street on wednesday they included year old sean williams who served in the u s army from to and now

offer a word of his own regarding trump hosting a veteran event on thursday night 'disgusting he wa understandably dubious of trump 's newfound fondness for those who served 'now he 's different the peddler said 'he 's born again the peddler did not expect that this born again trump would now favor allowing disabled vet to sell their ware on the golden avenue where his tower stand 'first class war vet second class back at home the peddler said he then added 'go take a picture of the planter he meant the large cement planter that trump ha placed outside the tower not to ward off possible terrorist but to keep away peddler a ha been reported by the new york time trump had used somewhat smaller planter to fill a marble bench in a stretch of the lobby that wa ceded to the public in

with a letter that presaged the one he would write regarding disabled vet vendor 'we have had tremendous difficulty with respect to the bench'drug addict vagrant et cetera have come to the atrium in large number trump wrote in the letter a cited by the time 'additionally all sort of 'horrors ' had been taking place that effectively ruined the beautiful ambience of the space which everyone love so much the city fined trump who subsequently removed the bench altogether he replaced it with an elegant version of a hat and scarf stand such a disabled vet might set up on fifth avenue if they were

freedom we have mckellar noted 'this country we served should give u the opportunity to come out and vend he wish big business folk were able to recognize the vendor a fellow business folk 'we have to

conspiracy internet site to the forefront of american dialogue trump later suggested that cruz ask a judge for a 'declaratory judgment that would put this issue to bed this of course would likely

n't want puppy do n't you think you should tell her 'i do n't want puppy ' in the same manner bear think that cruz should be forthright with the american people and go to the supreme court to get this question resolved once and for all the origin of the problem for bear and his birther associate when it come to obama cruz and especially marco rubio is the constitutional understanding of the phrase 'natural born citizen the birther movement would suggest that anyone born in a foreign country'in cruz 's case canada'would need to become formally naturalized in a court of law before being considered a natural born citizen in the united state most legal expert contend that cruz meet the qualification of this constitutional standard by having an american mother and thus obtaining her citizenship upon his birth in after the revolution the united state passed the naturalization act which said that child who were born to u s citizen outside of the united state also qualified a citizen but these standard are not clear enough proof for people like joseph farah the editor in chief of conservative site worldnetdaily 'is that what the founder meant farah said in a phone interview with the daily beast 'was it enough to have one parent be an american citizen doe it matter where you 're born this is a serious issue it 's not some crazy conspiracy theory it 's not some game it 's the constitution we 're talking about yet the mustachioed purveyor of conspiracy theory about obama 's birth in kenya really like cruz politically and called him 'a terrific candidate 'i personally think ted cruz is a terrific candidate one of the smartest guy in any room he go into farah said coming short of endorsing cruz 'i think he 'd be a fine president after all wnd sell a book by cruz 's father rafael called 'a time for action empowering the faithful to reclaim america which detail how christian should get more involved in politics not to mention wnd 's close affiliation with a fellow cruz lover frank gaffney who ha said that grover norquist is a secret informant for the muslim brotherhood so it 's not a if farah doe n't want cruz to succeed'in fact he 's raising these issue to ensure that he can farah worry that if the debate about eligibility standard doe not happen soon cruz 's birth will negatively impact republican primary voter and he suggested it 's only coming up now because it is politically advantageous for trump to create this dialogue 'the day that rubio emerges a a super threat the question will be raised about him farah said echoing a similar sentiment that many birthers share about the legitimacy of the florida senator 's citizenship status 'it just depends on whose ox is being gored a this debate about cruz 's presidential eligibility ha dragged on'with john mccain whose birth wa previously questioned raising the spectre of doubt about cruz and democratic congressman alan grayson filing a lawsuit'the rhetoric from the o g s of the birther movement have been ratcheting up 'he 's not eligible because he 's not born in the country mario apuzzo an insurance attorney from new jersey who filed a lawsuit in federal court in against president elect barack obama dick cheney nancy pelosi and congress alleging that congress had not properly verified his eligibility to be president in the supreme court denied to hear the case after a federal court in new jersey dismissed it and the u s court of appeal upheld the dismissal 'he wa born to an alien father apuzzo said of cruz 'he 's got a worse situation than president obama apuzzo added that cruz because of his birthplace would have 'divided allegiance compromising his ability to lead this is an argument employed by other original member of the movement who worry that a cruz presidency would set a bad precedent for future american politician charles kerchner a self described 'retired professional electrical engineer who wa one of the plaintiff in apuzzo 's suit think that it 's time for cruz to drop out of the race entirely 'what if the next time it 's north korea kerchner said about cruz 's country of birth 'you 're either pregnant or you 're not why do we have to go to these more exotic candidate because the political party want to do this he 's been writing about cruz and his birth on his personal wordpress blog since 'natural born citizen are created by natural law and the law of nature and nature 's creator not man made law he penned nearly three year ago upset that his case wa n't heard in court kerchner is happy that trump brought this issue to mainstream light again 'if i say to you a red chevy and a ford are both car doe that make a ford a red chevy kerchner asked 'you have to be totally free of foreign influence what if we had a cuban missile crisis and the president ha a father living in cuba kerchner said referencing cruz 's own father 'would he be a quick to pull the trigger if we have to 'it take two tiger in natural law to make a tiger he added 'it take two citizen to have a natural born citizen why do you have to go to all these sexy immigrant type kerchner said exasperated with some of the gop choice while mainstream medium and cruz himself might scoff at these suggestion from people like apuzzo'who said he 's tired of being called 'a kook when these same question were raised about obama they gained some ground in a quarter of american polled thought that obama wa born in a different country even in september of this year percent of american thought that he wa not from the united state initially cruz himself ha balked at the question of citizenship 'yes i 'm sure the media'with all due respect'love to engage in silly sideshow he said in an interview with cnn on thursday 'we need to focus on what matter cruz 's national spokesperson rick tyler told the daily beast 'it 's all nonsense ted cruz ha never breathed a breath where he wa not an american citizen but for the so called birthers a term that is pejorative depending on which member is talking this situation is of dire importance'especially for the people who want to see cruz win 'if i could say anything to anybody it would be to the supreme court'get off your as and make a clarification on who is a natural born citizen so we do n't have to do this again is that clear enough bear screamed from the side of a florida road before hanging up

would be 'very precarious if ted cruz were the gop nominee given that cruz wa undisputedly born in canada where trump wa wrong wa when he made his focus on how precarious that would be 'for republican trump possibly for the first time ever wa being too restrained it would be precarious for our entire nation if cruz were elected and then the u s supreme court deemed him ineligible to serve a president think about the impact it would have to our nation a we collectively waited for the court 's decision it would be a national crisis our ally would not know who is actually our president and our enemy might use the crisis to their advantage plus it would cause a dramatic drop in the stock market investor hate uncertainty now just so it 's crystal clear i 'm neither a cruz birther nor am i advocating that cruz may be ineligible to be president what i 'm saying is that the supreme court ha not addressed the specific of issue whether a person in cruz 's position is eligible to be president in accordance with the requirement of the u s constitution specifically article ii section of the constitution provides that a person can not be president unless he or she is 'a natural born citizen cruz wa born in calgary canada in and first moved to the united state when he wa four year old at the time of cruz 's birth his mother wa a united state citizen but his cuban born father wa not so is cruz a natural born citizen there are countless article debating this issue while some legal scholar support cruz 's eligibility others like fordham law school constitutional law professor thomas lee informed me that the question of whether cruz is a 'natural born citizen can be answered with two word 'it depends lee who wa an editor of the harvard law review and clerked for supreme court justice david souter explained that the issue could go either way lee noted there are two view of constitutional interpretation that he belief would support cruz'the textualist and evolutionist view but under the 'originalist view cruz could be deemed ineligible constitutional orginalists interpret the constitution by looking at the meaning of the document when it wa originally written ironically cruz is a constitutional orginalist and that is part of his appeal to conservative a lee noted cruz should actually disqualify himself from the presidency if he remained true to being an originalist once again however while learned people have offered well reasoned opinion we still do n't have the definitive guidance of the supreme court on this issue but this is no academic exercise there were already objection filed in new hampshire to knock cruz off the ballot for being ineligible and while the new hampshire ballot commission recently ruled in cruz 's favor it decision did n't resolve this issue at all in fact it added to the uncertainty the commission 's decision noted that since the question of what constitutes a 'natural born citizen ha not been 'answered with certainty by the court the commission ha 'no clear standard to apply it added 'this commission is not the appropriate forum for the determination of major constitutional question summing up the quandary well brad cook the republican chair of the commission told the medium at the time of rendering the decision 'it would be really nice if somebody would get this issue of law decided who ha authority to decide constitutional issue so every four year we do n't have this come up again and that 's where we are now given cruz 's ascendancy in the poll and the plausible chance he could be the gop presidential nominee this issue need to be decided by the federal court now but this is trickier that it would seem we the people just ca n't simply ask the nine supreme court justice to give u a quick answer professor lee noted that there are likely only a few party who would have the legal standing to bring a lawsuit in federal court to challenge cruz 's eligibility 'individual voter would not have standing lee noted because federal court require a 'concrete injury not a more 'generalized grievance bottom line lee belief it will take one of cruz 's fellow presidential candidate to bring a lawsuit lee doubted that super pac would have standing in federal court unless they could show a concrete injury if a gop presidential candidate were to now file a lawsuit in the federal court where cruz is on the ballot it could go a long way to resolving this issue waiting is precarious for all of u what if cruz win the gop nomination and the democratic nominee or a third party presidential candidate then file a lawsuit to deem cruz ineligible imagine if cruz is deemed ineligible only a few week before election day the democratic nominee would likely win in a cakewalk however the worst case scenario for u all would be that such a lawsuit is n't filed until cruz won the election and before he wa sworn in a president talk about a national crisis doe the vice president elect get sworn in while we wait for the court lee did caution however that the supreme court could deem this issue a 'political question and decline to get involved but president cruz would still likely be dogged by this issue his entire term leading to a possible crisis in confidence that 's why it 's in the best interest of all american ' regardless of political party to resolve this issue sooner rather than later it will give u all peace of mind plus it deprives trump of another non policy issue to distract u with which is truly great for america,43903.0

radiating from the unusual spectacle these men doing a style of dance almost exclusively done by woman and doing it with their face painted with fierce makeup turned them into instant viral star eventually landing them the oxygen show the story behind that joy however is the inspiration the real reason to tune in a the prancing elite project delicately chronicled in it first season for every 'yaaas that 's been cheered at the dancer a they thrust shimmy and shake during their infectious performance there have been countless telling them 'no no you ca n't do this style of dance it 's for woman no you ca n't perform at this parade no you ca n't be around our child no you are not 'family appropriate no you ca n't look like that we do n't know what to make of you they have been booed they 've been called abomination parent have shielded their child 's eye from them and mimed puking when they see them they 've been banned from event entirely some might say the kind of joy in their performing give you life in season one adrian say 'i just feel like i have this disease no one want to be around 'shake it off is n't just a song it 's a mantra a mean of survival for them it 's why when the prancing elite project debuted last year the daily beast called it tv 's most inspiring new show for all the reality tv trash that clog the television garbage chute'but that we god and kris

they make their way through the restaurant in fabulous furs'it wa a freezing new york day'and even more fabulous makeup they get the usual quizzical stare a kid at the next table is nudged in the shin by his mother who want him to conceal his snickering then in stark contrast the restaurant 's hostess recognizes the group and asks for a photo 'there 's a quote this season i love jerel say ''if you can make it through hate you can be great ' it 's a manifestation not just of the reaction to the group in the restaurant but to their very existence 'it stuck with me because it 's so true jerel continues 'we can make it through hate and look at u we 're on the second season proving that the branding of the elite a 'inspirational is no fluke he continues his speech 'no matter what background you come from no matter what gender or race you can be great he say 'you have to believe in yourselves by being yourself and not focusing on the negativity that come with whatever you 're doing differently from the social norm you can be great anybody can be great you have to believe in yourself consider our chat a state of the elite we did it once before the year prior just after the first episode of the prancing elite project aired i knew the fabulous cacophony that awaited me a tornado of beautiful energy that wa fruitless to even attempt to wrangle we 're at the same burger chain'although this time at it uptown location'and gleefully eating the same fried food their presence is met with the same mix of confusion and cheerleading from gawking stranger the message of everything they say is the same hater gon na hate love yourself stay positive but something seems different the elite are different in fact that 's the crux and the appeal of season two of the series come for the same inspiration stay to find out how it 's affecting this team 's own identity while season one in a way wa about us'whether we were able to accept and embrace a team of queer gender non conforming dancers'season two is about them luckily they are fascinating there 's tim who last year had trouble articulating how she identified herself and hated the word 'trans now 'i 'm a woman she say 'a lady i identify a a woman and see no different and for what it 's worth 'i always feel beautiful kareem publicly announced that he wa diagnosed with hiv how he and his boyfriend deshaun deal

jerel with his new hairstyle making the comparison uncanny 'i 'm the mama kristopher jenner the table explodes with laughter i ask them how this year feel different from when we were having for all intent and purpose the same meal the year before 'i just think it 's a more humbling experience now than it wa then kentrell say 'now we have to realize we 're really all that we have 'i 'm much stronger than i wa last year tim say a far cry from the person i met in season one who could barely speak when asked a question 'i 'm still soft spoken but i 've grown into a whole new person they taught me not let people walk over me that confidence sure ha to do with a greater sense of self she finally ha the courage to correct people when they call her 'he she doe n't care that you might find it strange that she 's keeping her name tim even though she identifies a a woman it 's what she want 'people expect me to do what is expected of every transgender person she say 'i have to be that voice to tell them that i 'm my own transgender i 'm not what people say i have to be or what transgenders do or how they live their life i live my life kareem is settling into the attention he got for publicly announcing his hiv diagnosis 'usually i 'm so private he say 'i do n't talk about what i do n't want to talk about and i do n't show what i do n't want to show so being open and raw wa different but it wa an area of opportunity it wa therapeutic in a way he understands the attention'it 's rare for a public person to come forward with their diagnosis'but he ha a hard time wrapping his head around the constant interest in discussing it 'i just live my life the way i wa living it he say 'it 's a part of my life but it 's not my life they 're all coming to term with the 'inspirational label that 's bandied around adrian get teary eyed remembering a boy who sent him a message saying that the elite inspired him to come out to his mother jerel ha a story about a married woman in her forty who said watching the show gave her the courage to come out a gay to her husband and stop hiding her true self 'our show is deeper than just dancing he say he marvel that for all the parent who tell them their image is not appropriate for child it 's child who respond the most to their show 'it make u work harder he say 'we used to respond back to negativity i know i used to i changed a lot i would want to defend my team so much but now i know that the world defends u for every negative comment we have positive thought now i realize i do n't have to defend my team the way that i used to the world is doing it for me in a positive way a rise in fame and visibility mean a bigger target is on their back 'you save a little area in your mind for all the negativity and throw it away but the rest of it is reserved for the positive kareem say 'we do n't put much energy in that there 's a scene from the first episode of season two that still stick with adrian even though he lived it he 's coaching his troop of young girl and one of the dancer amber tell him she wa told she could n't be a dancer because she 's a heavier person adrian can barely speak when she tell him this remembering all the time he and the elite were told they could n't do what they wanted because of their gender or the way they dressed 'she 's one of my best dancer he say 'i told her people tried to limit our success because of our gender just like they try to limit her success because of her weight i feel like there 's no limit to success not weight color size no matter what you are you

oil company ha already spent over year in russian prison for alleged fraud and clearly ha no intention of going back to be locked up again but day before christmas the russian investigative committee issued an international warrant for his arrest and the court in moscow endorsed it the alleged crime involves the murder of a mayor in siberia back in and given how long khodorkovsky wa in prison

a press conference in london 'a revolution in russia is inevitable the former oil tycoon said many in moscow were shall we say irritated and not only putin 's partisan even if people would like le of a heavy hand from the kremlin and more freedom to express themselves they 're hoping for modernity and stability not upheaval in the wake of khodorkovsky 's remark pressure on his supporter increased both in moscow and st petersburg several dozen policeman searched for criminal evidence around apartment office and even a private vehicle that belonged to employee of open russia a community of activist supported and financed by khodorkovsky the movement 's website openrussia org ha posted investigative report and opinion piece exposing human right violation and large scale corruption among top official in russia why did the kremlin go after khodorkovsky more than two year after putin pardoned him it 's not just the press conference certainly to hear khodorkovsky tell the story putin 's afraid of him 'putin see me a a threat economically because of the possible seizure of russian asset abroad khodorkovsky told the press the kremlin denied that putin had anything to do with the new arrest warrant a duma deputy dmitry gudkov suggested just how big the monetary question might be 'authorities do not want to pay over billion compensation to yukos in a tribunal in the hague ruled the russian state had force bankruptcy on yukos the biggest private oil company in the country in order to appropriate it asset and prevent khodorkovsky from entering politics the court imposed billion in damage which wa roughly percent of russia 's gdp at a time it wa already in recession since then the duma ha been working to change legislation to help avoid international court decision but by putting khodorkovsky on trial for murder even in his absentia authority shift the focus from them to him 'they are preparing the world for russia 's decision not to pay the money gudkov told the daily beast in a recent interview for khodorkovsky the exile 's life in france the uk or in switzerland wa never the same a in moscow where he had a team of young activist working for him his former partner and head of the yukos moscow management company aleksei kondaurov told the daily beast that this third trial against khodorkovsky is moscow 's revenge for several big yukos victory in international court including the strasbourg court of human right a well a the hague 'this is also a revenge for khodorkovsky and his open russia supporting opposition candidate at election kondaurov said last week

news analysis column and tv talking head declare 'this could be the year of the brokered convention this cycle which ha at least in the republican camp thus far taken so unfamiliar a shape ha heard the cry of 'brokered convention resound louder than ever i have no idea whether the din will subside once voter actually begin voting history say the campaign will begin to resemble those of recent campaign past but i do n't think the 'laws of politics are a reliable a say the law of gravity my goal here is not to predict but to explain why the lure of a brokered convention is so powerful why those of u who came to political maturity too late to witness one regard it possibility with the intensity of a chicago cub fan longing for a world series triumph the explanation is i think simple for a generation of political enthusiasts'professional and citizen alike'the spectacle of open contentious unpredictable convention are burned onto our memory and so is the frustration of coming to the political arena just a the importance and drama of the convention withered before our eye imagine a boy or girl of say ten year old first becoming aware of the political world if that seems premature most of the political junky i know reached 'political puberty a few year before biological puberty kicked in those child who are now somewhere between forty five and seventy plus would have witnessed

grandfather 's country cottage'we had no tv'to listen to the pier six brawl conducted by the republican and the three ballot battle it took for the democrat to choose adlai stevenson but you do n't have to have a medicare card to remember contentious convention for twenty eight years'from until at least one of the two party gathering provided a gratifying struggle over power and sometimes

ford and ronald reagan battle over a handful of delegate that will decide the outcome an attempt by reagan to force ford into announcing his running mate before the presidential balloting narrowly fails but in the heart of true political junky that rejected rule ' 'rule c ' attains immortality 'although the outcome of the democratic contest is assured'president carter ha the delegate to turn back ted kennedy'the convention delivers a floor fight or two a well a the spectacle of jimmy carter stalking kennedy around the podium in a failed attempt to inveigle kennedy into the 'arms aloft image of party unity on the republican side there 's a day 's worth of rumor and speculation about ex president ford becoming reagan 's running mate before reagan make a surprise appearance in the hall to announce that george h w bush is his choice what ha followed is eight consecutive cycle where almost nothing of drama ha transpired looking back over thirty five year the most significant event i can think of wa barack obama 's convention speech which put the obscure state senator on a path to the white house four year later other than that what we 've been privileged to witness is a spectacle stripped of just about every possible prospect of surprise a generation 's worth of convention where an actor 's monologue with an empty chair count a a major highlight is not what a generation 's worth of operative an it d journalist signed up for to offer just one measure of what ha happened when abc 's sam donaldson got hold of the nixon campaign 's minute by minute schedule for the it wa something of a minor scandal a dozen year later campaign operative were visiting the network every day to offer their minute by minute schedule yes there are good reason why convention have become infomercial the shift of power to the primary ha stripped them of their original purpose moreover with party official and office holder no longer controlling army of delegate the whole idea of a 'brokered convention run up against the reality that there are no broker at least not any more the ford reagan battle in and to a lesser extent the carter kennedy contest in were contested convention so would a multi ballot floor fight in cleveland next summer among the surviving two or three candidate if party elder were to meet behind closed door and deliver the nomination to say house speaker paul ryan that would qualify a a 'brokered outcome'though who he broker would be and whether gop convention rule would permit it are question a of now unanswerable still there are enough of u with fading memory of convention past and others who have seen the black and white film clip and videotape to make the lure of a brokered or contested or open or disputatious convention a powerful yearning and you do n't even have to be of a certain age to feel such longing after all think of how many chicagoans yearn for a world series flag to fly at wrigley a chicago cub fan who wa ten year old when they last won the series would now be year old well there are plenty of journalist little more than half my age who have lingered in their hotel room during convention watched the tempestuous battle of the past on their tv set and prepared for another night of the relentlessly predictable feeling 'please let me witness just one convention where we actually do not know what 's

party rather the pestilence that is the trump campaign is the result of a conglomeration of political academic medium and cultural elite who for decade have tried to act a the arbiter of acceptable public debate and shut down any political expression from american with whom they disagree they more than anyone else created donald trump 's candidacy and the increasingly hideous movement he now lead these are fighting word not least because no one really want the blame for creating the trump phenomenon and understandably so democrat want to perma glue trump to the republican so that the gop will never get his stink off the party even after he 's been defeated republican for their part ca n't post enough picture of trump and the clinton or play enough clip of trump noting that he voted for president obama and showering praise on hillary this is what party do and it 's natural for both the democrat and the gop to see who can hang trump on the other of course it all miss the point trump is too uncontrollably narcissistic to be genuinely attached to either party a much a republican point out the money he gave to hillary clinton for example the fact is that trump would have given money to yuri andropov if he thought there wa a photo op in it exhibit a his creepy un american attachment to russian dictator vladimir putin democrat can try to tar the gop with trump but trump 's a gop newcomer whose view on abortion health care and tax are mostly anathema to actual conservative it 's pointless to try to explain trump in term of political platform because trump himself is too stupid and too incoherent to have any kind of consistent political view about anything beyond hating minority and immigrant nuclear weapon 'with nuclear the power the devastation is very important to me drug 'that whole heroin thing i tell you what we got ta get that whole thing under control a random word generation program could do better to understand trump 's seemingly effortless seizure of the public spotlight forget about program and instead zero in on the one complaint that seems to unite all of the disparate angry faction gravitating to him political correctness this more than anything is how the left created trump i am not referring here to the daily political correctness that became normal after the s the reflexive self editing that we 've all learned to do almost unconsciously in the name of being nice to other people this early 'correctness wa always awkward and artificial but it wa n't overly onerous richard russo penned a satire of academic life in the s called straight man in which one of the professor reminded his colleague so often to include female pronoun that his nickname wa 'orshe a in 'he or she and while that kind of person might be annoying much of that stuff wa actually rooted in well meaning idea about inclusive language today however we have a new more virulent political correctness that terrorizes both liberal and conservative old line democrat and republican alike this form of political correctness is distinctly illiberal indeed it is not liberalism at all but maoism circa the cultural revolution the extremist adherent of this new political correctness have essentially taken a flamethrower to the public space and annihilated it center topic in american life that once were the legitimate subject of debate between liberal and conservative are now off limit and lead to immediate attack by the cultural establishment if raised at all any incorrect position any expression of the constitutional right to a different opinion or even just a slip of the tongue can lead to public ostracism and the loss of a job just ask brendan eich there is a huge vacuum left by this leftist attack on speech and it trump is filling it many liberal i know will scoff at this because they believe that american public discourse ha shifted irretrievably to the right but that 's because to them political discourse in the united state is already where they think it should be firmly centered on liberal idea they see conservative objection a aberration not a the view of half the population liberal won america 's culture war'and they did even if conservative undeniably won the contemporaneous economic war'and so liberal do n't really notice what they consider to be nothing more than mopping up operation on abortion gay right immigration and other hot button issue gay marriage is a good example liberal wanted gay marriage to win in the supreme court and it did leftist wanted more to silence their opponent even after those opponent completely lost on the issue ugly language that good liberal would normally deplore emerged not in the wake of defeat but of victory actor and gay activist george takei for example actually called justice clarence thomas a 'clown in blackface and said thomas had 'abdicated his status a an african american that 's heavy stuff and it would likely scan better written in chinese on a paper dunce cap i could reel off many other example when the new york time tell the rube that it 's time to hand in their gun when the washington post suggests that jesus is ashamed of them for not welcoming syrian refugee the week after a terrorist attack people react not because they love gun or hate syrian but because their natural urge to being told by coastal liberal that they 're awful people and that they should just obey and shut up is to issue a certain anglo saxon verb and pronoun combination with all the vigor they can muster and if they ca n't say it themselves they 'll find someone who will even if it 's a crude jerk from queen who ca n't make a point without raising his pinky like a mafia goon explaining the vig to you after you 've had a bad day at the track these brutish leftist tactic radicalized otherwise more centrist people towards trump not because they care so much about gay marriage or gun or refugee any other issue but because they 're terrified that they 're losing the basic right to express themselves many of these people are not nearly a conservative or extreme a the white supremacist nativist and other assorted fringe nut who are riding along on trump 's ego trip but they are cheering on trump because they feel they have nowhere else to go and for that liberals'especially those who have politely looked away a such method were employed in the public square'must directly shoulder the blame the great mistake made by both liberal and their most extreme wing on american left is to assume that ordinary people once corrected forcefully enough will comply with their new order this is of course ridiculous american do not magically become complacent and accepting multiculturalists just because they 've been bullied out of the public debate they will find a new vessel for their view and will become more extreme with each attempt to shut them down a the issue move from particular social position to the far more encompassing problem of who ha the right to tell whom to shut up and to make it stick nixon 's 'silent majority increasingly feel itself to be a silenced majority and trump is their solution note for example how trump turned the incident in which black life matter activist humiliated senator bernie sander to his own advantage he did n't bother drawing partisan line or going after sander trump and his supporter could n't care le about any of that and trump until that point almost had almost never mentioned sander instead he made it clear that he 'd never allow himself to be shut down by a mob that for his loyalist wa the money shot especially when trump pretty much dared blm to disrupt a trump event in effect inviting them for an as kicking a lot of people loved that shtick because they want to see someone literally anyone stand up to group like blm even if it 's in defense of poor bernie because they worry that they 're next for that kind of treatment for the record i despise donald trump and i will vote for almost any republican well okay not ben carson rather than trump i 'm a conservative independent and a former republican i quit the party in because of exactly the kind of coarse ignorance that trump represents the night newt gingrich won the south carolina primary on the thoughtful platform of colonizing the moon i wa out if in the end god turn his back on america and we 're left with only the choice of trump or hillary clinton i will vote for a third candidate out of protest'even if it mean accepting what i consider the ghastly prospect of a clinton administration but i understand the fear of being silenced that 's prompting otherwise decent people to make common cause with racist and modern know nothing and i blame the american left for creating that fear with that said we have to consider the gop elephant in the room if regaining their voice is all that trump supporter really want then why have n't they turned away from him a his statement have become increasingly insane trump reveled in the endorsement of putin an avowed enemy of the united state if obama had accepted a similar endorsement conservative would have impeached him recall that when the uk 's david cameron said a nice word about obama in the campaign people who no doubt now approve trump 's bromance with putin went berserk at this foreign interloping from one of our closest ally what 's it going to take trump 's staying power however is rooted in the fact that his supporter are not fighting for any particular political outcome they are fighting back against a culture they think is trying to smother them into cowed silence what they want more than any one policy is someone to turn to the chanting mob and say without hesitation 'no i will not shut up how long this will go on then depends on how long it will take for those people to feel reassured that someone besides trump will represent their concern without backing down in the face of catcall about racism sexism lgbtq phobia islamophobia or any other number of label deployed mostly to extinguish their dissent in the end the significant cadre of kook attached to trump will likely scare the normal away from their flirtation with all this little league brown shirting but the point remains that this is happening not because of an overly rightist gop but because american liberal complacently turning away from the excess of the left and eviscerating their own moderate wing have damaged the two party system to the point that an unhinged billionaire demagogue is raking in support from people who are now more afraid of leftist controlling the justice department than they are of putin or isi,61102.0

channel it jaded distrust in authority'but that all changed carter say on a day that scarred the american psyche and left it looking to the government for hope rather than scrutinizing it every move 'we the writing and producing staff went to work the day of the world trade center event carter remembers 'and people were cry at work and it wa just tragic and unsettling it soon became clear that this wa going to change everything in the country and le importantly for our tv show 'we saw clearly that there wa a much minimized interest in government conspiracy instead we put all our trust and faith in the government to protect u and while the x file question authority we american at the time were searching for someone to protect u and provide u with homeland security today in what carter call our post edward snowden 'citizenfour world there ha been a resurgence in mistrust in the government spurred in part by the nsa 's breach of privacy'making the perfect time he say to finally reopen the x file 'so many of the right and liberty that we gave up willingly have been abused he say 'the government admits it 's spying on us'presumably for our own good but this is a frightening thing a lot of people my age recognize that there is a lot of potential for abuse people give up their privacy so willingly now believing that if you 've got nothing to hide why not but without understanding that that could also lead you down the path to injustice that what you say today could be used against you tomorrow what you buy today could be used against you tomorrow 'there 's a whiff of fascism there he add 'these are frightening prospect for me to carter the xenophobia and destructive rhetoric trumpeted by high profile presidential candidate is a grim foreshadowing of the abuse of power inherent in tad o'malley 's vision of the future 'when you get presidential candidate saying 'just bomb the shit out of them ' or 'do n't allow this group of people into the united state ' carter say alluding to donald trump 's proposed anti muslim mandate 'it just suggests a kind of wholesale intolerance that could trickle down or filter down into all kind of policy so i think that whether we want to admit it or not there is a sort of'not the internet version not the conspiracy site version'but there is a sort of possibility of a new world order much ha changed since when the x file went off the air and in today 's political climate carter say he pick up the paper every day and see something that would make an excellent x file he 's thought of more potential investigation for mulder and scully than he 's had the chance to put on screen he say and while fox 's event series is limited to six episode it last hour end on a 'cliffhanger that carter say leaf the door open for more in the new run of episode being called the x file ' tenth season we see the return of several key character including mitch pileggi 's beloved assistant director walter skinner along with a few familiar face long thought to be dead the cigarette smoking man mulder 's deadliest adversary and the shadowy manipulator supposedly behind some of history 's most traumatic event return with a badly scarred face and a hole in his trachea one side effect of all those year spent addicted to morley carter promise an explanation will be given for the smoking man 's miraculous survival in the last episode of the upcoming series the lone gunman the fan favorite trio of hacker and conspiracy enthusiast who helped mulder and scully out of sticky situation will also return despite their deaths'albeit in a fantasy sequence a for our chance of seeing mulder and scully back in action after the event series concludes carter sound hopeful 'fox owns the show and i think if the event series doe well now i 'm certain they would want more carter say 'i 'm sure the actor would n't want to commit to episode the standard length of a season of x file they have busy life and family but i 'm sure there 's a possibility that there could be more we leave that door open anderson for her part very cautiously leaf room for another potential return 'i think it definitely could if people wanted it to she tell me 'there 's definitely enough there chris carter 's vision for it is far reaching and based on how he 's delivered these six and the fact that he seems to have gotten the flavor right for people the right mix of what we used to do with the contemporary spin on it is encouraging and promising it could potentially be moved beyond that'that 's not to say that it would or that we could make it work it 's just to say that i think that were we to want to make it work we could we know what mulder the believer would probably say come on scully the truth is still out

daily beast ha learned that 's a seven fold increase in the number of case of civilian casualty it ha acknowledged since the airstrike campaign against the self proclaimed islamic state began month ago the new incident of civilian casualty which spanned most of led to at least death and injury a u s defense official told the daily beast but with the american military launching more than airstrikes over the course of the isi war the toll could very well increase in any war particularly one in which the only consistent eye on the battlefield are foot in the air it is impossible to say for sure that so many strike could lead to so few innocent death a recent un report said that nearly civilian had been killed in the fighting in iraq alone'most at the hand of the terror army not the coalition fighting it the military plan to release summary of these new case of civilian casualty in three batch the first batch wa released last week when the u s military admitted that it had killed eight civilian and wounded three others in five incident between april and july of last year on friday the military will acknowledge five more incident of killing or wounding innocent the week after that it plan to announce an additional four case the daily beast ha learned none of the case led to the death of child the military concluded according to defense official up until last week the u s military had only admitted to killing six civilian in two incidents'one in iraq and one in syria in both of those case child were believed to be among the dead none of these new case led to the death of child according to the defense official with those two additional case the u s ha acknowledged killing civilian in instance during that time the u s ha conducted strike in iraq and syria the coalition ha conducted sortie according defense department statistic a of august the u s military had investigated allegation of civilian casualty the new case of civilian casualty fall into two category generally speaking in some instance civilian appear at a strike site minute beforehand there is not enough time to waive off the attack in other case the pilot conducting the strike realized after the fact that the person killed wa not a suspected jihadist fighter but a civilian 'a lot of these were self reported by our fighter one defense official explained to the daily beast the minimization of civilian casualty ha been a keystone of the u s effort against isis'at time to the frustration of both military commander and iraqi official who feel the u s is being too cautious 'the command and others are trying to find out what they can do they do n't get any guidance they are told what they ca n't do one official familiar with the strike approval process at u s central command explained to the daily beast but despite all the claim of caution there is no way to independently ass the u s military 's contention that only a handful of innocent have been killed by the american attack the war is too dangerous for most independent observer and with so few u s troop on the ground in syria there are not enough to go to a strike site afterwards and ass the effect during the last war in iraq for example the u s could send ground troop to ass the damage from airstrikes moreover there is little pressure from capitol hill for the u s military to explain how it ass civilian death by american airstrikes or what it is doing to prevent them rather such determination are left to the commander and the military lawyer signing off on strike 'u s and coalition force work diligently to be precise in our airstrikes we take great care from analysis of available intelligence to selection of the appropriate weapon to meet mission requirement to minimize the risk of collateral damage particularly any potential harm to civilian said air force col patrick ryder a u s central command spokesman in a statement to the daily beast 'we take all allegation of civilian casualty seriously and ass all incident a thoroughly a possible in accordance with our commitment to transparency we are working to release assessment finding of closed allegation a soon a possible but at time 'as soon a possible ha n't been all that soon for month and month the u s refused to admit that it had killed a single civilian in the isi war and the surge in announcement now happened only after an intense struggle within the national security establishment in some case the u s military reached it conclusion about civilian casualty month ago but official could not agree on when to release it finding outgoing u s central command chief gen lloyd austin wa keen to release the finding a soon a possible two defense official said but austin ran into bureaucratic resistance and so death and injury caused month ago are only being acknowledged now,7527.0

in preparation for part i of the next epic british costume drama due to hit u s tv screen war and peace the eight hour bbc adaptation complete with heaving bosom and lot of very silly hat will be screened in four two hour block on all the a e channel lifetime history a e produced by the bbc and harvey weinstein and with a cast list comprising the cream of british acting talent including paul dano year a slave lily james lady rose of downton abbey fame gillian anderson and jim broadbent iris the lavish series ha already aired it first two hour in the u k to ecstatic review but this war and peace come with some controversy writer andrew davies'a veteran screenwriter who among other triumph adapted the original house of card novel for the bbc'has been accused of mercilessly 'sexing up the plot of leo tolstoy 's page epic account of the napoleonic war and russian society most scandalously he 's included an incestuous relationship between h l ne tuppence middleton and her brother anatole callum turner they are seen in bed together in the first few minute of the new adaptation davy ha said the incestuous liaison between h l ne and anatole kuragin is 'crucial to his adaptation and denied that he invented the relationship 'brother and sister h l ne and anatole are in an incestuous relationship but tolstoy indicates this so subtly that most reader including me at first reading miss it altogether he todl the radio time 'this relationship and their attitude to it is so crucial to our understanding of them that for me at least it need to be on screen the daily beast asked several prominent scholar of the great russian epic if they felt davy wa justified in including the plotline or if indeed the incestuous affair wa a case of extreme dramatic license professor faith wigzell emeritus professor of russian literature and culture at university college london begin block quote there is something in the book about it but in the form of rumor at the end of vol i part pierre recognizes that there is something not right'even nasty'in his feeling for h l ne and recall that he 'd been told that anatole had been in love with her and she with him and that wa why anatole wa sent away unlike any of the other female character h l ne is not herself attracted to any of the men around and docilely doe what her father want by implication perhaps because her heart such a it is ha been given to her brother in the bbc adaptation pierre doe not seem to have much in the way of perceptive insight but is just a social klutz so davy ha moved the incest from rumor to action i do n't mind too much though i think it could have been done another way however i am hating the bbc adaptation le than i feared it 's always hopeless when you have taught a novel for year and you see it dramatized i 'm still watching'and not out of masochism professor catriona kelly professor of russian university of oxford begin block quote andrew davy is n't making it up tolstoy ha pierre doubting whether he should marry h l ne kuragin because of the rumor she is in love with her brother and he with him ' ' ' 'but she 's stupid i 've often said so myself he thought 'there is something nasty in the feeling she 's aroused in me something forbidden i wa told her brother anatole wa in love with her and she with him that there wa a whole scandal about it and anatole wa sent away on account of it all the word that tolstoy us for 'sent away suggests this wa done by the family note though the implication is that the incestuous relationship is in the past not the present natalia krylova ph d lecturer of russian language and culture university of minnesota in the original text any kind of incestuous relation between the two otherwise doubtlessly sinister character is le than obvious when pierre recall the the rumor to which he wa once exposed he ca n't provide a reliable source of this information given how starry eyed imaginative and impressionable a person he is it is not quite obvious whether it is a figment of his own imagination or a sure fact in one later episode anatole come to h l ne to borrow some money and kiss her 'naked shoulder but h l ne 's 'naked shoulder are her signature appearance trait'representative of her dressing style and woman 's fashion of the time a well a of the particular archetype of femininity she is the explication of beautiful helen of troy secondly the way in which affection wa expressed a in russia and b in the beginning of the th century were strikingly different from the modern western standard i do n't believe that anatole 's kissing his adult sibling wa in fact meant by tolstoy to be a demonstration of his character 's incestuous inclination i do not belong to the conservative cohort who belief that all classic art is a sacred depot of untouchable artifact that should be left alone in their original petrified form but i hate some contemporary film director ' attempt to play on the most primitive instinct of their audience in order to secure commercial success for their production i will watch the adaptation'but i am totally prepared to be perpetually frustrated and annoyed over the week when this series will

chatting to a woman sitting opposite me and mentioned that richard dawkins would be an interviewee at a live book night i regularly host 'richard dawkins'his toxic worldview doe n't speak to a young feminist like myself she responded with a sense of venom in the week leading up to the interview the dawkins fascination'and the questions'continued with various people to whom i spoke would i challenge his constant hostility to religion what wa he like in person and what about his anti islamic stance now a regular part of his twitter post 'dawkins 's public profile in recent year seems completely consumed by his ego one distinguished academic told me bizarrely though nobody mentioned the word evolutionary biology if you want to see how ridiculously inflated the richard dawkins celebrity medium circus ha become in recent year simply type his name into google here 's a typical story that 's likely to crop up dawkins 's inability to keep silent on social medium is why these lame article constantly keep reappearing still the online retaliation that follows is often worse scrolling down through my twitter feed after reading the aforementioned article i noticed dawkins mania wa trending yet again gang of holier than thou liberal were queuing up to furiously out tweet each other attempting to show who wa more morally outraged 'delete your account demanded graham linehan a comedy television writer with more than half a million follower on twitter'where he ha an astounding million follower himself ' dawkins is to put it mildly a bit of a sensationalist his favorite online hobby is to ask question and conduct thought experiment that are a constant work in progress this may be an intriguing idea if you are in a small oxford science tutorial with polite like minded student but on social medium where anger and moral superiority relentlessly explode into fireball of poison and hatred almost every second conducting such conversation is a recipe for disaster dawkins seems to relish the role of bad boy contrarian though and the question he tends to ask while usually well intended do n't have the direct yes or no answer he 's accustomed to working with in the science world the method for coming up with a credible hypothesis work a follows conduct an experiment display your evidence'backed up with data'and then draw a conclusion a to whether something is true or false it 's a liberating idea that ha marched humanity towards progressive secular value free from nonsensical superstition but those same so called enlightenment value lest we forget also brought u the atomic bomb and eugenics hardly great example of dignified human progress via twitter and the daily online news agenda dawkins regularly put himself forward a a global commentator for western civilization the trouble is however news story covering complex subject such a war persecution famine pedophilia refugee genocide economics genital mutilation and murder all require considerable nuance something the british scientist distinctly lack among dawkins 's more outrageous tweet he ha asked why islamic scholar have n't produced a many nobel prize winner a jew he ha said that it is immoral not to abort a fetus known to have down syndrome he ha tried to logically differentiate between rape at knife point and date rape unfortunately dawkins 's name is now becoming more closely aligned with these trivial online rows'which tend to get bogged down in semantics political correctness and moral outrage'than anything of real intellectual substance that 's a shame considering his enormous contribution to evolutionary biology over the last four decade thank goodness then that brief candle in the dark the successor to an earlier memoir an appetite for wonder ignores such petty arguments'well mostly when point scoring doe occur it 's normally with other scientist such a the late stephen jay gould with whom dawkins disagreed about many matter in their shared field of evolutionary biology but even when the glove come off in this arena dawkins maintains his most gracious and dignified role the great communicator to a popular science audience in an appetite for wonder published two year ago dawkins described growing up privileged and pampered in kenya a the child of a colonial serviceman working for the british empire then returning to attend public school in post war britain which subsequently allowed him to enter into the zoology department a an undergraduate in oxford in an institution in which he remained for most of his life brief candle in the dark and an appetite for wonder are extremely similar in tone and both are a little snoozy when it come to the strictly autobiographical part the most controversial event we encounter here are dinner party where disagreement with fellow academic over saying grace in latin end with a polite handshake or joke rather than a punch up skinny dipping at an academic conference'after one beer too many'appears to be the most rebellious act dawkins ha ever committed in his life ironically given how abrupt his online persona can be at time dawkins seems to have a penchant for good old fashioned british politeness he spends much of the narrative self consciously apologizing to the reader in advance for fear he may somehow offend following my public interview with dawkins last october many member of the audience remarked to me how surprised they were at the genial courteous sweet polite and extremely intelligent elder statesman like figure they encountered on stage that said it 's when he release himself from the shackle of polite conversation that dawkins knuckle down to what he 's best at science a soon a that happens in brief candle the narrative shift from first to fifth gear almost instantaneously in the opening chapter dawkins asks if we are witnessing a constructive merger between scientific and literary culture which he refers to a the 'third culture that is book by professional scientist written in a language that appeal to the general reading public he might have been describing himself in the selfish gene his debut he deploys a style that is part high literary and part sci fi to seamlessly and lucidly blend science and allegory dawkins wa inspired to write the book because there wa such a widely held misunderstanding of darwinism at the time and in both brief candle in the dark and an appetite for wonder he continually return to his magnum opus a a point of reference one of the most persistent'and annoying'criticisms of the selfish gene claim dawkins is that it mistake the level at which natural selection defined a the non random differential reproduction of gene act a the late john maynard smith'a great champion of dawkins 's work'once commented 'the selfish gene report no new fact what it doe offer is a new world view to understand how this the new world view dramatically altered the culture of mainstream science in the mid ' s one need to comprehend exactly what wa being discussed among evolutionary biologist at the time the main debate concerned two topic group selection and kin selection the group selection debate wa exacerbated by v c wynne edward 's book animal dispersion in relation to social behaviour which argued that behavior adaptation had evolved by group selection the survival of some group and the extinction of others many biologist were extremely skeptical about wynne edward 's thesis and argued that natural selection typically act by favoring some individual but not some population during this period english biologist w d hamilton proposed another theory about how natural selection act hamilton 's thesis'now more commonly referred to a kin selection'follows the neo darwinian synthesis which center on the gene a the unit of natural selection gene hamilton postulated are what encourage social altruism and cooperation between related specie repeat that last sentence out loud just for one moment it 's one of the most liberating empowering and positive force on the planet and it 's why i consider the selfish gene'which reinforces that idea with striking clarity'to be one of the most important book i have ever read dawkins while acknowledging the debt we owe to hamilton claimed that hamilton would have been wiser to adopt a full blooded 'gene 's eye view of evolution and in the selfish gene dawkins also urge u to recognize the fundamental distinction between replicators that is entity whose precise structure is replicated in the process of reproduction and vehicle entity which are mortal and which are not replicated but whose property are influenced by replicators or a dawkins eloquently put it himself in brief candle in the dark 'genes survive by pulling phenotypic lever of power but why are those phenotypic lever bundled into discrete vehicle which we call organism and why do the immortal replicators 'choose to gang up with other gene to share vehicle this wa the point at which i went beyond hamilton while never really going against anything he said when dawkins is writing with this absolute clarity of tone'where there is no room for nuance whatsoever'he truly is an extraordinary thinker of exceptional proportion in the world of science that is evolutionary biology like all science requires mathematical formula and precision of logic to make perfect sense something either is or it is not there is no grey area or room for rebuttal and debate unless of course new evidence emerges but where dawkins ha found criticism in recent year even from his closest supporter and fan is his insistence that human affair can somehow be magically explained within the tight parameter of this dogmatic scientific approach where logic and evidence are the only requirement of an argument human being are incredibly complex illogical and emotional creature and therefore trying to understand their various culture wide range of behavioral pattern desire political allegiance tribal prejudice and crisis of identity through the prism of scientific understanding by itself is an idea built on foundation of sand the late gary becker a nobel prize winning economist and one of the great champion of the neo liberal movement during the ' s tried to apply similar credential to global capitalism turning economics at the time from being a discipline that talked about traditional subject like inflation employment bank and stock to suddenly hubristically claiming it could now understand all of human behavior economics like science is simply incapable of doing this dawkins 's most vocal opponent seem to miss this very salient point focusing their effort instead on his lack of political correctness a particular obsession for white middle class intellectual elite in the west they claim that his ridiculing of islam for example border on racism to which dawkins typically responds islam is a religion not a race it 's a valid point i also happen to think that any religion'regardless of whether it 's christianity islam buddhism or judaism'should be open to ridicule satire and blasphemy especially given that in our present age ridiculing the prophet muhammad is now deemed an act punishable by death by hardcore fundamentalist jihadist however by the same token in the sweeping one sentence generalization dawkins so often give when speaking about religion'which he tends to masquerade a an insistence on logical answers'the complexity of human culture seems to get brushed aside and the argument get lost or doe n't even take place at all it 's a if fact for dawkins'and not human emotion or feeling'are all that matter in this world i suspect there may be a valid reason for this though in his specialized field evolutionary biology for the most part dawkins is not dealing with human being a his subject matter in brief candle in the dark he even point out that it 's ridiculous to think of evolutionary theory always culminating in man and he make it abundantly clear that homo sapiens should not be privileged over other specie however in the world of journalism politics history and culture a world for which dawkins ha tried but ultimately failed to become a global spokesperson in recent year nuance debate paradox and contradiction are ubiquitous and most important they are vital in keeping the discussion interesting democratic and robust at all time dawkins repeatedly insists'on twitter most days'that the history of religion is inspired by nothing more than totalitarian control and bloodshed there is certainly truth in this worldview i too have written about the collusion between the catholic church and the state in ireland and about the totalitarian tendency behind that collaboration but to dogmatically insist'as dawkins tends to'that any form of religion is always idiotic inherently violent and almost infantile in it intellectual construction is to laugh in the face of human civilization and history it 's also to ignore a very important trait of human being empathy i once watched an irish tv show where a woman explained to dawkins that the notion of a god gave her comfort when a member of her family died dawkins looked at her directly and said 'that is fine but i 'm afraid it 's simply not true i think he miss the point religion may play for some people in wired for culture evolutionary biologist mark pagel argues that religious meme historically have helped human to survive cooperate and prosper crucially though pagel doe not insist on the need to believe that the idea contained within religion are necessarily true to be beneficial to human culture similarly jared diamond'a fellow scientist and atheist for whom dawkins ha enormous respect'in the world until yesterday state 'if religion did n't bring some real benefit to offset those opportunity cost any atheistic society that by chance arose would be likely to outcompete religious society and take over the world religion must have function and bring benefit otherwise it would n't have come into being and could n't be maintained even the outspoken atheist philosopher neuroscientist and promoter of all thing secular sam harris'who regard dawkins a his intellectual hero'claims few scientist and philosopher have developed strong skill of introspection harris also insists that there is a connection between scientific fact and spiritual wisdom and that it is more direct than most people suppose there can be no doubt that the god delusion which ha sold three million copy wa vitally important in raising the bar about how to speak up for secular and rational value in the public domain when it wa published almost a decade ago but it appears a though dawkins ha no interest in exploring the fact that many humans'at some point in their lives'seek out something greater than themselves call this what you like a spiritual otherness an inner introspection or even a sense of sacredness beyond the cosmos the key point is this the main desire for that 'otherness in the first place mean it purposely want nothing to do with the material world it ha no relationship with fact or evidence it 's simply a state of mind and a yearning for something deeper or wider than that constant prison cell of human illusion we politely refer to in our everyday life a 'the self in spite of dawkins 's constant daily online protestation it 's pretty hard to envision a time when religion will completely vanish off the face of the earth because no matter how much scientific evidence no matter how many theory or mathematical explanation we accumulate about the universe that knowledge will never be able to completely replace a need'in certain people'for mythology fantasy and ritual none of which ha any basis or foundation in material truth,48889.0

1075,10227213.0,2016-01-24T05:01:00+00:00,dear atheist do n't fear 'in god we trust ',this month a sacramento based emergency room doctor filed a federal lawsuit seeking to remove all reference to god from u currency in his lawsuit michael newdow argues that the motto 'in god we trust place a 'substantial burden on atheist in a statement that might seem ironic newdow argues that it is burdensome for atheist 'to personally bear a religious message that is the antithesis of what they consider to be religious truth this is n't newdow 's first foray into religious freedom legislation in he gained notoriety for his attempt to remove the phrase 'under god from the pledge of allegiance it 's not even his first attempt to alter u currency ten year ago he unsuccessfully argued in front of a federal judge that it use amount to a religious affirmation the use of the phrase 'in god we trust in u currency first appeared in salmon p chase lincoln 's secretary of the treasury in the middle of the civil war received a letter from a pennsylvanian minister requesting some recognition of god in a national motto the phrase found it way onto all u currency in the thick of the cold war around the same time and for the same reason that 'under god wa added to the pledge of allegiance a part of the cultural war on godless communism a congressional vote elected to place the motto on all u money certainly in some respect newdow is correct to see the motto a a modern innovation if removing religious affiliation from u currency is the goal you have to wonder if newdow ha missed the pound truncated pyramid in the room the fairly innocuous phrase 'in god we trust is far le specific than the occult imagery that currently adorns the common one dollar bill the most prominent iconography on the are the eagle and the pyramid which together constitute the great seal of the united state the pyramid is a throwback to ancient egypt but is in many way a much tamer version of the seal that franklin and jefferson envisioned noted egyptophiles the version that they initially supported included an egyptian pharaoh seated on a chariot and passing through the parted water of the red sea the motto they preferred wa 'rebellion to tyrant is obedience to god anyone familiar with the biblical story of the parting of the red sea can hear the thinly veiled threat pharaoh doe n't stay atop that chariot for long franklin loved his version of the seal so much that he adopted it a his personal motto and today the conservative right is fond of invoking franklin 's motto in political debate the final design for the great seal which wa accepted by congress in wa presented by charles thomson a philadelphia merchant who finalized the design by combining the idea of three separate committee thomson said that the pyramid symbolized 'strength and duration and that the latin inscription 'novus ordo seclorum a new order of the age referred to a new form of government and 'the beginning of the new american era the disembodied eye that float atop the pyramid he added with the inscription 'annuit coeptis refers to the way in which providence favored the american cause but others have questioned thomson 's straight laced explanation they see the motto and symbolism of the seal a emblem of the philosophical secret society the freemason and the rosicrucian today membership in these group is available to almost anyone interested in paying due but in the eighteenth century these secret organization were open only to the intellectual and social elite for those who subscribe to the idea that our currency is originally masonic there 's a lot to work with many of the people involved in the multi step design for the seal although not thomson himself are known mason for those who believe in the 'new world order the idea that a secret powerful elite is controlling global government and commerce the fact that those very word appear on our money is a blatant giveaway the 'all seeing eye perched above the pyramid is a symbol of the great architect of the universe the masonic equivalent of a deity for conspiracy theorist the masonic imagery go further even the number of feather on the eagle 's right wing can be seen a corresponding to the number of degree in scottish rite freemasonary if such interpretation seem excessive bear in mind that in when he wa invited to consult on the adoption of the great seal eminent harvard art historian eliot norton disparagingly described it a a 'dull emblem of a masonic fraternity while the extent of freemasonry 's influence in the founding and establishment of the united state is wildly exaggerated almost everyone concedes that franklin roosevelt and henry wallace the secretary of agriculture were freemason and it doe seem to have been the case that for them the imagery of the dollar bill wa evocative of masonic principle for wallace the 'new world order became the 'new deal it 's easy to see why people argue that u currency is replete with esoteric religious symbolism and yet oddly atheist are not seeking to remove the eye and pyramid on the basis that they are either freemason or ancient egyptian symbol of course the use of religious imagery and slogan is nothing new greek and roman coin routinely included portrait or emblem of everyone from cupid to jupiter major city like athens would mint coin with their city 's favored deity here of course athena on them many coin even had image of temple on them it wa precisely because roman currency depicted the emperor a a quasi deity that jew prohibited it use in the temple the use of religious imagery continued throughout the byzantine and roman period when cross regular appeared on coin produced all over europe there 's nothing new about impressing your religious belief on your coinage the symbolism on the dollar bill is certainly evocative of secret society but even contemporary freemason acknowledge that imagery on the dollar bill resonates with other tradition a well a thomas m savini director of the library at the new york grand lodge headquarters said in 'we use the eye but optician use the eye it make u look ridiculous if we say it link into some masonic connection that wa not there a similar kind of ambiguity surround the use of 'in god we trust it became ubiquitous only during the cold war and could almost be considered nationalistic propaganda it wa on the basis that 'in god we trust is more secular than religious that a federal judge threw out newdow 's case ten year ago those concerned about the religious messaging either mainstream or occult of u currency have option perhaps they should stick to credit card or apple pay the cult of apple may be idolatrous but it 's not religious not yet

hq'sits one of the most fascinating museum on the planet the army humbly call it the museo de enervantes which can be roughly translated a the museum of stupefacients but this boring technical title underplays the incredible collection of artifact on display the highlight of what mexican soldier have nabbed from drug trafficker some seized narcotic themselves are in the cabinet but these are the least interesting item a lot of people already know what marijuana crystal meth and heroin look like although the black cocaine on show is a novelty the drug lab machinery is more enthralling including sprawling shiny contraption to cook meth on an industrial scale piece from trap car the vehicle used to smuggle drug over the border in gas tank tire and false seat also illustrate the ingenuity of narco engineer more frightening is the heavy weapon room of captured cartel firepower you see that narco thug do n't only use belt driven machine gun and grenade they even posse shoulder held rocket launcher such a the rpg or 'vampire which can take out tank but the museum 's main attraction is undoubtedly a room under the title narco cultura the narco culture cabinet display the ostentatious bling that drug lord buy with their billion of bloodstained buck some piece are worth high five digit in the stone and metal alone gun are bathed in gold and decorated with gem in the shape of word and picture some stone form the name of their capo owner such a a pistol with an engraving of acf'amado carrillo fuentes the lord of the sky others have image of mexican revolutionary who the gangster hail a hero including emiliano zapata and pancho villa others still have name of fashion designer such a the italian tailor versace i find it bemusing that drug lord can praise both revolutionary and entrepreneur they are rebel capitalist the narco memorabilia extends to award that cartel army give their warrior for bravery a medallion from the zeta ha a letter z on one side and picture of gangster soldier in heroic battle pose on the other it is the narco equivalent of the victoria cross'or tiffany cross walking on through the hall you see a cowboy waistcoat which is really a bullet proof vest a cell phone bathed in gold and a carved wooden chair in the form of the grim reaper it get weirder and weirder dominating the end of the narco culture hall is the weirdest item of all a four foot high statuette of a saintly warrior clad in medieval armor it 's an impressive piece of art it core is a plaster figurine which is worked over with gold and gem for the coat of mail and fine paint for the skin and goatee beard the crusader vaunt red templar cross on his chest and sleeve and clasp a broadsword he ha that despondent expression of a holy man wise but sad a seen on image of jesus and his saint he also resembles one of mexico 's most brutal gangster warlord soldier seized the statuette from cartel thug who baptized themselves a the knight templar after the order of warrior monk who fought for christendom between and the narco templar made dozen of similar statuette and put them in shrine to kneel and pray before they call them 'santos nazarios it is the image of their leader nazario moreno known a el chayo or el m s loco'the maddest one troop have also found prayer to saint nazario printed in booklet in the style of regular catholic prayer book that vendor sell at the stoplight in mexican city a one say give me holy protection through saint nazario protector of the poorest knight of the people saint nazario give u life anthropologist can have a field day dissecting this narco holy image saint nazario mix latin america 's popular catholicism with the bling of the drug trade with the rock star status of crime lord personally when i first see a narcotic trafficker looking like jesus it seems hilarious then i think about it for thirty second and realize it 's terrifying adding to nazario 's cult status he wrote his own holy book journalist often refer to it a his bible but mi pensamientos my thought doe n't have complete religious story and parable like the christian bible instead it is a collection of musing similar in structure to mao tse tung 's little red book a nazario authored his religious rant named his cartel after crusading monk and wa venerated like a saint this dominates coverage about him in journalese shorthand he is 'the head of the bizarrely named knight templar who wrote his own bible even a he trafficked ton of crystal meth to the united state but these entertaining detail overshadow other feature of nazario 's empire that are important to understanding what mexican organized crime ha become nazario moved from drug trafficking to a portfolio of crime that made him a major player in the local economy'a gangster capitalist the knight templar took over iron mine ignoring environmental regulation so they could sell record quantity of metal to hungry chinese factory they took extortion to new extreme making cent of every dollar that moved even from big business and attacking those who did n't pay they burned thirty truck of a local unit of pepsico and they waded into the avocado lime and cattle industry for american your guacamole on game day the metal in your kid 's remote controlled car and the beef in your burger may have passed through the knight templar ' hands'alongside the meth smoked by your local fiend in his home state of michoac n the maddest one got his tentacle into the entire political and judicial apparatus with mayor police commander and politician on his payroll the state apparatus rotted to the core'making it later implode like a putrid tree trunk nazario 's rule wa so insidious and brutal it ultimately unleashed mexico 's largest vigilante movement to take him down the so called autodefensas'or self defense squads'became a significant third force in the mexican drug war fighting alongside the government security force and cartel death squad the militia unleashed a bloody but bewildering battle they built a network of barricade that weaved through the state they took back town that the government supposedly controlled already sometimes they fought alongside the mexican army sometimes against them the conflict embarrassed president pe a nieto and led his government to make a dangerous alliance with the vigilante migrant in the united state were also key in toppling nazario michoac n migr s from california to oregon were so distraught by the terror in their homeland they helped finance the vigilante movement some returned home and took up kalashnikov i found immigrant on the frontline who went within week from washing dish in los angeles to fighting gun battle against cartel hit men and if that is n't enough color for nazario 's crazy tale the narco saint also died twice a drug lord of the maddest one 's status ha multiple life nazario first died in december mexican federal police claimed they killed him during one of the most ferocious battle of the mexican drug war a fight involving two thousand federal officer and about five hundred criminal gunman amid the melee the officer said they shot nazario but his gangster henchman carried his corpse away his death wa confirmed when a grave appeared with his name on it apparently police did n't want to dig it up and check the president at the time felipe calder n trumpeted nazario 's demise a a grand victory in his war on cartel it wa especially sweet a michoac n is calder n 's home state and the place where the president had launched his campaign against organized crime after his supposed death nazario 's follower began venerating him like a saint and statuette and shrine appeared even more bizarrely people reported seeing his ghost wandering around michoac n dressed all in white under the leadership of this phantom saint the knight templar became more powerful than ever by the sighting of ghost nazario had become absurdly common on a single day i spoke to three people who claimed they had seen him but i still wa n't sure i discussed the testimony with a fellow journalist were these source really seeing him we asked or wa this a figment of their collective imagination the former turned out to be true in march mexican marine announced that nazario wa still alive but they also said that they now had killed him really this bizarre situation reminds me of a quote attributed to spanish surrealist artist salvador dal the master supposedly said 'i wo n't return to mexico because it is a country that is more surreal than my painting to prove that nazario wa truly in heaven or hell the marine released a video of his body it certainly look like him however while the marine say they killed the maddest one with two bullet in the chest this film show a face that ha blatantly been beaten the eyelid black and nose purple in the murky world of the mexican drug war there is always a second story and i hear a credible account that explains this bruising according to this alternative version of event nazario wa n't really killed by marine but he wa battered to death by his own bodyguard working with vigilante it is of course illegal for vigilante to murder people in theory so the vigilante handed in the corpse and it wa convenient for everyone to say the marine did it the bodyguard had got so fed up of nazario 's megalomania they turned on him his final legacy wa not of his troop venerating him but of them hating him nazario 's messianic complex illuminates a memoir he wrote while most drug lord erase detail of their life nazario actually self published this autobiography and distributed it to his follower it wa never on sale but thousand of copy flowed around michoac n town and village it wa a hot book if soldier found people with them they would often arrest them for being templar afliates the page are fittingly titled they call me 'the maddest one the book ha a front cover with a silhouette of nazario 's face over a deep red background it is reminiscent of a silhouette image of che guevara printed on t shirt throughout latin america a well a styling himself a a messiah nazario fancied himself a guerrilla hero maddest one is written in decent grammar maybe with the help of a writer with a gun to his head nazario say he did n't do a day in school splattering it page are amusing saying such a 'every nation ha the government it deserves and every government ha the criminal it deserves it also provides unusual insight into the life and deranged mind of this gangster warlord the memoir need to be carefully scrutinized but agent tracking him confirm many of the fact a mexican investigator who worked for the federal intelligence service and then a special unit fighting the knight templar gave me many rich detail on the mob and shared his wealth of file dea agent also handed me information on the maddest one among the american agent who tracked nazario 's mob wa mike vigil who spent thirteen year working in mexico more than any other dea agent he often went undercover posing a a drug trafficker to get into their crazed world during vigil 's time a trafficker shot at him from three foot the bullet missed vigil also had the pleasure of turning down the offer of a three million dollar bribe from honduran kingpin juan matta ballesteros'who wa later convicted of the kidnapping of dea agent enrique 'kike camarena however while the agent confirm many name and date in nazario 's account they clash with his vision nazario portrays himself a a social bandit subtitling his memoir 'diary of an idealist agent say he wa one of the most dangerous serial murderer on the planet with few real ideal at all 'i think he is a psychopath that want to romanticize his criminal activity by writing these manifesto vigil say 'the fact of the matter is that he is a drug trafficker he is a killer and he represents the worst of mexican society but ha these delusional romantic idea i have lived in mexico since so my work on it go deeper than the other country covered in this book i also had great help from michoac n journalist including francisco castellanos leo gonzalez dalia martinez daniel fernandez and jesus lemus lemus may be the reporter who know most about drug cartel in the world thanks to a quirk of fate he wa jailed for three year alongside top capo it is a painful story he had written an expo of a corrupt politician and in revenge prosecutor filed trumped up charge against him accusing him of working for nazario lemus thankfully resisted day of torture and refused to sign a confession and the charge were thrown out after three excruciating year my reconstruction of nazario 's life is also helped by many people from his homeland who knew him the vigilante uprising to topple the maddest one created a euphoric atmosphere and people were unusually open in revealing detail of the crime world among those i talked to who knew nazario were several of his gunman who later became vigilante apatzing n businessmen cristobal alvarez a woman married to nazario 's cousin and a lime farmer who templar tortured while nazario wa present the valley he hail from is a tight knit community with broad inter linking family it is a land blighted by poverty criminality and belief in the supernatural these feature all helped mold the narco saint and his legend from when he wa a small child excerpted from ioan grillo 's gangster warlord bloomsbury press,18964.0

share state funded benefit they are not recognized a legal couple for the purpose of tax break they can not even visit each other if one partner is in the intensive care unit or on his or her death bed in a public hospital no matter how long they may have been together ' even if they were married legally in another country but all that may soon change italy is the last major european nation with a complete blind spot when it come to recognizing same sex couple a legal partner last june the european court of human right ruled that italy wa in breach of human right because it offered no option that would allow same sex partner to share the same benefit a straight partner specifically citing adoption shared pension benefit and tax break a key right that are missing on january italy 's senate will start debating the so called cirinna law named after monica cirinna the senator from prime minister matteo renzi 's center left democratic party who officially introduced the bill last october renzi ha made the recognition of civil union a priority in his premiership and vow to pas the bill into law 'we can hardly think we can go to europe beating our drum about immigration or the deficit limit and then be last in the line when it come to human right cirinna told reuters last week but we live under the shadow of the vatican dome and catholicism here is different than in other country it is a presence to be clear the cirinna bill carefully avoids talk of 'marriage which the italian constitutional court ha ruled may exist only between 'natural heterosexual couple instead the bill is simply about allowing same sex couple the right to be recognized the same way non married straight couple are a a 'social formation or life long partnership that is n't bound by a marriage certificate much a france ha done with it pac civil solidarity pact for more than year former italian prime minister romano prodi tried in vain to table a bill back in but it failed to get off the ground one reason it ha taken so long to get such a bill to a vote is because of over what exactly to call the same sex union to avoid any connotation of marriage meanwhile naysayer have threatened to tack on thousand of amendment the right wing nuovo centro destra or new center right party run by angelino alfano silvio berlusconi 's former wingman ha had considerable success delaying the bill 's progress alfano who recently said the use of surrogate mother should be treated a a sex crime is not so subtly backed by several high ranking catholic cardinal who have managed to keep this law out of parliament for year the bill ha been whittled down since cirinna first introduced it and there are now several point of contention on both side including the highly divisive article referring to 'stepchild adoption at face value that part of the bill pertains to those case where a child born to a man or woman in a previous heterosexual relationship could be adopted by the new same sex partner but legislator and the church warn that the rule are too loose and individual exception may be granted by italy 's juvenile court which ha the final say on all such adoption an estimated child in italy have at least one homosexual parent according to a now decade old study conducted by arcigay gay right association in because the cirinna bill a it stand doe not allow for autonomous or independent adoption of baby who are not related to either member of a same sex couple opponent fear that article provides a loophole through which same sex couple could eventually adopt opponent also fear it would surely pave the way for full autonomous adoption or even surrogacy which is strictly prohibited in italy on wednesday lawmaker who oppose the bill even went so far a to propose a new surrogacy legislation whereby any parent ' heterosexual or same sex ' who employ a surrogate mother outside of italy will face year of jail time and a million fine if it is determined that they 'rented a womb to conceive the law would apply regardless of whether surrogacy is legal in the country where it wa commissioned there are even ludicrous threat that those child who were born to surrogate mother would have to be put up for adoption the new surrogacy legislation drew harsh criticism from gay right group and those who support option for infertile couple 'this is indecent said gabriele piazzoni head of the lgbt right group arcigay 'a law intended to recognize right can not then suddenly be transformed into one that criminalizes and threatens prison term even with all the haggling over the fine point of the bill it is still likely to pas unless opponent are able to rally a filibuster to block or stall it indefinitely there is also a possibility that the debate will be so divisive that it will require a referendum which could spell trouble for proponent in a country like italy where conservative catholic tend to get out and vote late last year at the vatican 's synod on the family under pope francis those in attendance agreed that while gay are welcome in the church pew they will never be allowed to walk down the aisle 'regarding proposal to place union of homosexual person on the same level a marriage there are absolutely no ground for considering homosexual union to be in any way similar or even remotely analogous to god 's plan for marriage and family the synod father wrote in their final document 'in every way the synod maintains a completely unacceptable that local church be subjected to pressure in this matter and that international body link financial aid to poor country to the introduction of law to establish 'marriage ' between people of the same sex a important a component a the right to have a child is to many same sex couple most supporter of the cirinna bill do n't want to lose their chance to have same sex union recognized legally on the issue of the stepchild adoption clause alone even renzi ha hinted that they might be willing to concede on that issue just to get the law passed but some like marilena grassadonia president of the rainbow family association say the law should be all or nothing she told the daily beast that a whittled down law is n't enough 'the stepchild adoption amendment must remain she said 'otherwise it becomes an empty law both side are taking their case to the street on saturday a coalition of gay right group held demonstration in more than public square across italy under the banner 'svegliati italia or 'wake up italy anyone attending wa asked to bring alarm clock and timer a prop to make the wake up point 'the law if passed will change the life of many gay and lesbian people and especially their child whose life it will undoubtedly improve say arcigay 's piazzoni 'we need to give people back their dignity to remind our government that their objective at hand is to ensure equality for all a goal that so far remains elusive but not to be outdone italy 's catholic bishop are holding their own demonstration on the th under the banner 'family day at the enormous circus maximus in rome where there is a clear view of st peter 's dome and it shadow on the horizon with news of the family day demo the lgbt group quickly adopted their own new mantra 'family gay no doubt to rile up the vatican traditionalist the conservative catholic say they too will rally a million or so opponent of the law 'the italian bishop said cardinal angelo bagnasco president of the italian bishop conference 'are united together and ready to defend promote and support the universal heritage that is unique family womb of life the first school of humanity of relationship and of dialogue the church ha long held that italian lawmaker should be focusing on 'more important issue like unemployment and government reform rather than busying itself with a civil union law but not everyone at the vatican ha outwardly embraced the bishop ' plan least of all pope francis on the one hand he told vatican judged considering annulment 'there can be no confusion between the family god want and any other type of union ' the family founded on indissoluble matrimony that unites and allows procreation is part of god 's dream and that of his church for the salvation of humanity but pope francis also told the newspaper corriere della serum that he understood why state would seek 'to regularize different situation of living together in order to ensure health care and other economic benefit then he said that the church would have to 'look at the different case and evaluate them in their variety not exactly an endorsement of the cirinna law perhaps but neither is it a strong an opposition a we 've seen from many of his fellow churchman the bill debate kick off on the th and barring unforeseen delay could come to a vote within a week if it pass in any form which it surely should it will be seen a a major defeat to the conservative of the catholic church and even if it pass a just a shell of it original incarnation it will be seen a a worthy compromise by many in the lgtb community ' a necessary first step towards equality for all,9967.0

bitching and oneupmanship doe not break any mould the real housewife of the potomac is like 'new york ' 'atlanta ' 'orange county ' new jersey ' and 'beverly hill ' featuring a group of woman living astonishingly empty seeming existence that we are supposed to feel are glamorous and something to aspire to like the 'atlanta ' group this one is all black and bi racial'which raise the first and a yet unanswered question of why is a show set in potomac all black or biracial woman there may indeed be a group of upper and upper middle class black woman in the potomac area and dc suburb but one of the woman in this show say that they are in the minority themselves yet the show is n't mixed and even with it race nucleus acknowledged neither is it an examination of why the woman float in their own petty bitchy universe it 's not a if they do n't socialize with white woman the latter are shown to be fellow guest at a party gossiping and smiling flutteringly so why conceive the show a an all black show without examining the mechanic of race and exclusion a part of the narrative is this enclave within an enclave self selected and sustained on the part of the woman or cruelly imposed upon them or both or neither since the failure of it 'dc ' and miami series bravo seems incapable of casting a mixed 'housewife ' show with 'potomac ' peel back the familiar parade of fast retort anguished close ups and glamorous frock and you seem to have a show conceived to show a collective of woman fighting with each other for social supremacy using all the insidious mechanic of exclusion and stigmatization that racism itself'at least in part'operates by first there is gizelle who proudly tell u her father wa one of the first black member of the texas house of representative her husband wa a cheater she ha twin daughter and the only book of etiquette she obeyed wa her own she say there is something oddly stepford about not just 'potomac ' but all the other place where the 'housewives ' bloom like algae they bang on about manner and etiquette and infraction of these thing and then invariably end up ripping out each other 's hair extension and speaking over each other to try and voice the best punchline or putdown to a confrontation one must know where to sit at a party but'two hour in'if you want to push someone into a pool feel free the gizelle intro wa clear she wa going to have an 'etiquette ' storyline katie meanwhile 'loves the white boy and 'the jewish boy in particular she is from a 'famous family of philanthropist and is conservative so her family doe not like her being unmarried'her squeeze the white and jewish andrew doe n't want to rush into that for katie not being married 'is not a good look she could n't imagine why andrew would n't want to marry her what wa n't there to love she asked kittenishly the non kittenish response from this viewer wa maybe he want more from the relationship than just to feel like a fetishized romance object and want to make sure the relationship ha a proper foundation just a guess katie you 're welcome robyn said she wa a free spirit a pr doing unspecified pr y thing she wa ready to throw out her wedding dress after getting divorced from her husband juan however juan and robyn still lived together slept together and raised their child together and so wa naturally surprised to return home and find her wearing her wedding dress a she had been egged on to do by gizelle interspersed with these introduction were picture of the potomac river tennis and golf club and mansion the mansion i think are supposed to look luxurious but really look like gated prison and like other 'housewife ' franchise the woman lurch listlessly from one mansion to another gossiping in way that seem wholly artificial the question that persists is le who are these woman but what do they do 'potomac ' seems especially bizarre a we know at the outset the black woman are an enclave within an enclave and so the real question already is'do they circulate with the white woman we see a peripheral and if they do not what are the mechanic of racial exclusion whether imposed or self electing that operate here no time for such deep and meaningfuls kid because next it wa time to meet karen karen is married to ray 'the black bill gate whose job and role remained undefined karen appears to be a mega snob and mega materialistic'ironic a

other woman were ready to move in for her husband and she wa ready to take on all comer at the palace gate karen spoke with the airy tone of the grande dame and gizelle said she wa 'the diva diana ross and patti labelle rolled into one karen said something about wanting to pas the rein on to the next generation of black woman a if she wa the queen of some kind of some kind of principality preparing to elect her heir or heir despite the thick fog of absurdity around her karen 's surname i noted wa 'huber ' just like mr huber'the hideously nosy neighbor of desperate housewife karen seemed much more keen to exclude other black woman and judge them than help them one of those kind of people who after gaining entry into whatever tier of society they have aimed for quickly pull the drawbridge up behind her gizelle admitted to being 'a little judged by karen and so the first animosity of the series wa sown this began when charisse whose sport manager husband did n't live at home and wa widely suspected to be more than practically absent from their marriage a she claimed threw a birthday party for karen and gizelle occupied the 'center seat ' this wa apparently simply not 'done ' in potomac how exhausting it must be to live there'i 'm so glad to be living in new york where i will gladly take any of the lady to the malibu diner at rd and th where the only manner infraction is to be rude to one of the staff and where the 'done ' thing is to eat one 's bagel either chatting amiably to a companion or deliciously silent on your own with book or newspaper this rumbling resentment over the center seat issue'karen wa still kind of center depending on the camera angle'exploded a every 'housewife ' confrontation tends to at a party in this case a crab boil at charisse 's first there wa outrage that gizelle had bought her hair stylist 'who on earth walk around with the help at a private event queried karen with withering disgust there wa a reference to gizelle 's behavior being appropriate 'in the ghetto not the potomac then karen told gizelle how offended she had been at her sitting at the center of the table at her birthday do presenting her with a list of potomac etiquette rule which were a asinine a you would expect them to be if gizelle ever came to a function of hers said karen she should be mindful of the rule with the awareness of themselves a a minority came the very opposite to awareness and empathy around surmounting restriction and ridiculous hurtful 'rules ' instead the woman gleefully practiced all the trick and trap of superiority that make other people 's life miserable how much fun to be the oppressor in heel wig and full make up what wonderful progress a portmanteau of scene from future show showed the usual'rows

worry about these day just at the moment that bear are eating up china 's stock market a money continues to flood out of china with beijing 's bad boy client in north korea playing with nuclear weapon like a child with match and the nation around the south china sea pulling together to push back against beijing 's expansionist design there'now taiwan loom large a another setback with strategic implication to be sure chinese leader probably are not concerned by the peace pigeon union which support bird racing on the island that political party think a victory on the th will help remove the taint surrounding the sport which ha been caused by the kidnapping of pigeon for ransom and other unsavory activity but china can not ignore the remainder of what is now called the third force a group of activist who have formed party and in the process transformed taiwan politics by now it is a foregone conclusion that the opposition democratic progressive party will capture the presidency tsai ing wen who fell short in her bid in ha a virtually insurmountable lead in a three way race she led eric chu the candidate of the ruling kuomintang by percentage point in the latest poll by the cross strait policy association james soong of the people first party look like he is in third place a shade behind chu tsai 's dpp ha won the presidency before in and the victor then chen shui bian

show the kmt losing of those seat the dpp the challenger could capture seat and there 's more bad news for the kmt the new power party formed last year is generally considered the island 's third most popular party likely to play an important role in legislative coalition building and it extraordinary emergence make chinese both in china and in taiwan fearful why many taiwanese especially the younger generation do n't think they 're 'chinese and this ethnic divide mirror a political split the third force generation represented by the npp and other party is pushing taiwan toward 'independence 'recognition the island is not part of china'faster and harder than tsai 's dpp is willing to go and youthful voter are engaging in politics to force change in the direction they demand a bit of history the kmt under chiang kai shek fled what it call 'the mainland in and transplanted to taiwan the republic of china with the capital in taipei to this day it maintains taipei is the only legitimate government of 'china on the other hand the communist party ruling from beijing belief taiwan is the th province of the people 's republic of china despite the competing claim the communist party feel comfortable with the kmt because both believe there is only one china and that taiwan is part of it thus it is no surprise that xi jinping general secretary of the communist party and the kmt 's ma ying jeou president of the republic of china in taiwan could meet in singapore in november smile shake hand and talk about the future of their one and indivisible country tsai 's green on the other hand believe there are two state their country is 'taiwan not part of a greater chinese nation the obama administration worried that the new taiwan consciousness would anger beijing

sitting on the sideline but nonetheless anxious tsai may be willing to keep the peace with beijing'she ha publicly pledged to maintain the 'status quo 'but it 's not clear the island 's young people

that the new winner will probably work with tsai and her party where it count in the legislative yuan in the past the kmt 's control of the legislature meant it could do what it wanted the ruling party for instance rammed through trade deal it had signed with beijing during president ma 's two term ma thought those deal would bring about closer tie with china in fact those trade agreement

worth noting that among all the candidate in both party the one with the best odds of becoming the next president is hillary clinton with the iowa caucus just week away do n't you think it 's time we paid attention to the multitude of policy proposal and program she ha rolled out over the last seven month they may not lead the nightly news or go viral on social medium but they are breaking through with voter in iowa and new hampshire there are two dozen in all fleshed out with fact sheet according to a tally provided by the clinton campaign and they range from national security to quality of life issue it 's a liberal 's wish list but the problem clinton tackle are universal and there 's something for conservative too in taking on student debt lowering the price of prescription drug providing a tax credit for care giving and in the midst of the holiday announcing an ambitious billion plan to find a cure for alzheimer 's by if you hate government and think it 's too intrusive clinton 's probably not your candidate but if you 're caring for one of the million alzheimer 's sufferer in the country or you or someone you know ha been affected by the disease in some way then you 're with newt gingrich who tweeted his approval of the clinton plan or julianne moore who played a linguist afflicted by the disease in 'still alice and tweeted her support or if your family or someone you know ha been affected by addiction clinton wa the first of the candidate in either party to realize how big a problem heroin and prescription drug abuse ha become in new hampshire claiming so many young life it wa at a town meeting in august in keene where clinton became aware of the extent of the problem when almost every hand went up at a substance abuse forum signaling a personal experience she researched the issue and followed up say joe grandmaison the former democratic party state chair in new hampshire who crowned bill clinton the 'comeback kid after his second place finish in the primary an unabashed hillary fan grandmaison observed that her diligence on the addiction issue recalled the 'listening tour clinton took when she first ran for the senate from new york in 'you do n't have to be terribly cynical to think it is mostly a public relation tour but hillary demonstrated just the opposite grandmaison told me 'helping people in this way is who she is and it 's better politics than normal because it cut right through the cynicism grandmaison had just returned from a clinton event in portsmouth when i reached him on the phone it wa cold and snowy and he had waited minute in line to get in but he wa still chuckling over the little boy who told clinton his mommy doe n't make a much money a his daddy 'and that 's not fair because she work harder than he doe that elicited lot of knowing laughter along with clinton 's standard answer about equal pay he went on to say the woman who introduced clinton at the event brought people to tear a she told of caring for two alzheimer patient her year old husband and his year old mother 'everybody reach a certain age and they fear it 's in their future and there 's not a damn thing they can do about it grandmaison said expressing what ha to be a universal worry about a disease that claim mind and memory and ha no cure in sight it might also be political pay dirt sitting in the sanctuary of the portsmouth church with people squeezed into every available seat clinton 's empathy and her command of information were on ample display 'it show her at her best grandmaison say adding 'those of u who have a great deal of affection for her feel she 's been misunderstood the clinton campaign ha released two new ad related to alzheimer 's one about a new hampshire librarian who care for his year old mother and must take her to work with him because he ca n't afford day care the other feature an iowa woman mother of five whose husband passed away in may at age after suffering from early onset alzheimer 's in the ad clinton is visibly moved a she embrace the woman then say she spoke with the four leading researcher 'who are untangling the neurodegenerative disease and their excitement about more money for research a opposed to 'some additional military asset clinton say 'just think of the life it would save in an election cycle that ha been anything but conventional clinton is running a textbook campaign methodically laying out her proposal from what she would do about isi and terrorism down to her view on gmo 's genetically modified organism in our food clinton wa asked about gmo 's at a recent baltimore fundraiser a donor who wa there told grandmaison that he thought that would stump her but she ha a three point program it 's almost comical how prepared clinton is especially when compared to trump who offer very little in the way of conventional policy 'she ha a different electorate than he doe say matt bennett with third way a centrist democratic group while the republican are focused on style and rhetoric the race between clinton and sander is much more substantive 'and she 's got to make clear what she stand for and because she is the favorite to become

coddington say she want to embrace the freedom to work on project of her own choosing coddington a r j cutler 's brilliant documentary the september issue demonstrated wa a vital creative pivot for the magazine and an equally vital foil for editor in chief anna wintour both woman have long emphasized the respect they have for one another the new york time described today 's news of coddington 's day to day stepping down a one of the 'tectonic plate of fashion shifting'the senior position of editor at vogue are long held and coddington ha been in place since the year wintour herself took over one of the recurring tension of cutler 's film wa for u to wait to see a coddington herself would have to wait to see how intact her passionately shot and much cherished fashion shoot would remain after wintour had edited them gallery grace coddington through the year from young model to 'vogue ' doyenne photo coddington would nervously eye the completed edited spread laid out to see what had been cut and what had been retained it wa coddington who wa the breakout star of the documentary if we followed wintour meeting designer and perceived the glamorous whirl of the public figure far more intriguing wa coddington'wry and stoic amid the rail of clothes in vogue 's corridor her dedication to the artistic pursuit of what her day job wa and the frustration and very visible pain when her creative wish were stymied coddington told business of fashion today 'i really love vogue it 's been in my life always they discovered me a a model at i 'm not running away from vogue because it ha opened so many door but it will be nice to collaborate and nice to go out and give talk to people it 's just another approach i 'm certainly not going into retirement i do n't want to sit around a the september issue crystallized coddington'with her ethereal cloud of red hair and fine features'has become a brand herself perhaps her departure from vogue is the best kind of karmic result of the fame she ha accrued coddington 's longevity is both instructive and inspirational fashion in general and high fashion in particular may seem shallow and overpriced and the industry and hype that swirl around it absurd and detached from most people 's life coddington however seemed a very rooted human presence in this high pressured world coddington started reading vogue a a teenager which she recalled in the september issue a a 'chic thing totally 'out of context for the non metropolitan life she lived in north wale 'everything i did i fell into she said remembering winning a vogue modeling competition and heading to london we saw her gamine beautiful photographed by lord snowdon in she stopped modeling after a car crash her eye wa smashed into the driving mirror and she had to have a lot of plastic surgery two year later she went back to work a a junior editor at british vogue coddington 's aura of power may be different from wintour 's but the fascination with her and the respect for her work is a resonant a it is for the vogue editor in chief it is significant in itself that coddington is now represented by great bowery a 'super agency for high powered creative force like annie leibovitz and bruce weber coddington'for so long the backstage cinderella ha become a famous and overtly influential a those photographer and designer whose work she laid out in the page of vogue 'i suddenly realized that i needed some help from outside coddington told bof 'i did n't want to be pigeonholed into just styling a shoot i wanted to do something beyond i approached them and they were willing to help me on all sort of aspect they 're thinking up idea for me which is fun matthew moneypenny great bowery 's chief executive told bof we are extremely honored to have grace coddington join great bowery and look forward to supporting and working with one of the most original iconic and deeply creative figure in the fashion world i 'm sure it come a no surprise that we are already receiving very significant and interesting inquiry which we look forward to exploring to add to her autobiography published in and already optioned for a movie coddington is also working on a perfume with comme de gar ons and possibly an animated film from her 'catwalk cat ' illustration series in the fall phaidon will publish a book of her work for american vogue spanning the last year coddington told the september issue that she had 'never dreamt she could be a model or fashion editor but she had 'just loved page and picture in her early year a a fashion editor the photographer norman parkinson had taught coddington 'to always keep your eye open never go to sleep in the car keep watching whatever you see out of the window she recalled this surveying the majestic garden of versailles remarking how beautiful they were and how strange to think how old they were too 'i think i got left behind somewhere because i 'm still a romantic coddington said smiling before remembering the business she wa immersed in 'you have to go charging ahead you ca n't stay behind perhaps there is a grainier part of her vogue partial departure story yet to emerge during the september issue coddington 's frustration and upset at the spiking of spread were a evident a her passion and love for fashion consoling a colleague after wintour had rejected his choice for a piece on color blocking coddington cautioned 'you 've got to be tougher you have to demand because otherwise you 'll be blamed do n't be too nice even to me honestly you 'll lose you have to learn a way to beat the path through to make yourself felt and make yourself necessary and find way that work for you for vogue of the people who had gone from the magazine a lot 'just could n't take the heartbreak you have to be fairly tough to withstand that we saw her a one of her spread wa being 'whittled down a she put it in the september issue 'i 'm furious i care very much about what i do or i would n't be still doing it but it get harder and harder to see it just thrown out and it 's very hard to go on to the next thing but the next scene saw coddington in her beloved paris at the couture collection a fabulous creation followed fabulous creation down the runway surely the sweetest thing is that the extra fame and standing the september issue bought coddington ha meant she is now mistress of her own ship she is able not just to vanquish the accrued grief over the creative heartbreak she endured at the magazine but also to exercise a new freedom to craft a fresh creative chapter that is all

deerstalker cap in an episode from the second series of masterpiece 's contemporary set sherlock the title character impulsively us the hat most associated with the literary detective to hide his face from the paparazzo it inadvertently becomes his signature when the photo land on the front cover of britain 's tabloid 'what kind of hat is it anyway a frustrated sherlock wonder 'is it a cap why 's it got two front when martin freeman 's watson informs him that it 's called a 'deerstalker he add 'you ca n't stalk a deer with that what are you going to do throw it some sort of death frisbee he promptly chuck the hat across the room with no intention of ever putting it back on his head yet there cumberbatch is wearing the maligned hat along with more arthur conan doyle era victorian period dress in the new sherlock special 'the abominable bride set to premiere simultaneously for the first time in britain and the u s on january there are horse drawn carriage in the street of london and a curlicue mustache on john watson 's face there 's even an over sized pipe in holmes 's mouth what happened to the modern day sherlock viewer have grown to love over the past five year when period tinged photo started to leak from the set earlier this year sherlock 's co creator steven moffat wa quick to clarify that the change wa made for this one off special only and not a permanent shift in the series 'the special is it own thing moffat told entertainment weekly in march 'we would n't have done the story we 're doing and the way we 're doing it if we did n't have this special it 's not part of the run of three episode so we had this to do it'as we could hardly conceal'it 's victorian he added 'it 's kind of in it own little bubble a for the nature of that story it 's a bit more supernatural than a typical episode of the show which tends to rely on the detective 's on the spectrum attention to detail along with modern technological advance to solve it convoluted case this time we 're dealing with a 'ghost story 'ghost story work better in a victorian setting moffat said recently 'this strand of doyle original story that are creepy and scary and the chiller we have n't done much with in the modern show but putting it back into victorian time you think it 's a chance to do a ghost story really'a creepy scary one according to moffat 's co creator mark gatiss who also play mycroft holmes in the series the special 's title is derived from an off hand reference sherlock make to the case of 'ricoletti of the club foot and his abominable wife in doyle 's short story the musgrave ritual but beyond that small clue the showrunners revealed little else about the plot actor rupert graf who play inspector lestrade and sport enormous muttonchops a the period version of his character remarked in a behind the scene featurette for the special how everything in the sherlock world slows down without the benefit of modern technology 'one of the great thing about the modern day sherlock is the speed with which he can globally get thing done graf said 'in this you have to use telegram and morse and i think that ha an atmospheric shift cumberbatch added that the time period transformation did not change much about his character whom he describes a 'very old fashioned even in a modern setting 'he 's very contained in another era he said 'so for me it feel weirdly at home for this character but the decision to air a one off special a opposed to kicking off the highly anticipated fourth series this year likely ha more to do with cumberbatch 's demanding schedule than any grand artistic statement not only did the actor star in a divisive version of hamlet this past year but he also had a starring role in black mass stirred controversy with his trans

transitioning from nostalgic i love lucy rerun and throwback sitcom like hot in cleveland to edgier more current fare you might expect from the creator of an hbo comedy that once had four single new

however wa sex and the city perhaps not surprising considering starr 's involvement a well a the show 's legendary costumer patricia field call something an heir to that iconic series and draw not just the aforementioned skepticism but also risk the ire of the passionate worshipper of carrie samantha miranda charlotte and their manolos yet there 's the same uncanny ear for the kind of current punny dialogue that turned carrie 'could n't help but wonder ' bradshaw into a hero and a meme four strong and fiercely different woman and a depiction of dating that is both brutally blunt and romantic'all dressed in a wardrobe and world that 's just a little more fabulous than our own 'we elevate without making it unrealistic field say 'just a little elevation get up on your high heel do n't go fly away 'i think at it core sex and the city wa just trying to be a frank and honest look at relationship and those thing do n't really change starr say how people are meeting each other are changing and that 's certainly reflected in younger which ha character swiping left on dating apps and staring at iphones waiting for text instead of twiddling thumb while staring at the phone on the nightstand 'sex and the city wa about an independent woman who wa going to live her life and not define it by marriage but wa still romantic he say 'this is a show about a woman who is trying to reinvent herself and want to reconnect with that youthful romanticism and see if she 's still got it in other word more story about relationship and dating but from a different perspective'one that incorporates topic like feminism and aging and what that mean it 's that bit that critic seem to be responding to the first season ha a percent 'fresh rating on rotten tomato with the san francisco

'you 're on younger anecdotally at least the show seems to be mission accomplished for tv land crossing generational and gender divide with fan paste magazine even said 'younger feel like it belongs on a different network and that 's probably a great thing for tv land a resounding talking point for season one wa foster 's performance a liza not just because of the gawky charm she brings to the role but because of how believably the year old pass for a year old on the show it made for an unique experience for the tony award winner who despite a critically hailed turn on the short lived abc family series bunheads had not endured the kind of invasive and exhaustive press tour like the one for younger which routinely had her being grilled with invasive question about her age and appearance'forced therapy by way of journalist 'it wa definitely interesting to navigate because i had n't really thought about any of those thing foster say 'i 'd be asked about my beauty regime and i 'm like 'i do n't really have one she laugh for a minute magically looking like liza both youthful and carefree and wise and seasoned at the same time 'so i 'd just make thing up to try to sound

i am changing and getting older am i relevant well i have a career ' the psychoanalyzing mirror a typical episode of younger which ha liza being forced to constantly consider her age while trying to appear two decade younger all while feverishly trying to keep the house of card her lie ha built from collapsing completely complicating thing though starting to ease liza 's conscience in season two the secret 's out at the end of younger 's first season liza finally come clean to josh the young stud she 's been dating but who think she 's it wa necessary to avoid a starr said the gilligan 's island curse but watching josh 's hurt reaction at the betrayal you suddenly realize that this heroine you 've been rooting for to keep up this ruse is actually doing a terrible thing to people 'i think because it 's sutton foster and she 's so winning you have this character that on the surface you really love and just assume she would always be doing the right thing say starr the natural charisma and likability make the sarah jessica parker and carrie bradshaw comparison abundantly valid 'you want them to succeed but they 're going to make mistake when josh discovers that liza wa lying 'the ramification are real he say it also open more opportunity to explore not only their dynamic but dig deeper into the strong bench of supporting character that operate around them there 's mazar 's maggie who previously had been the only other one to know about liza 's deceit'because she helped facilitate it a the web spin out of control it maggie who ha to help liza untangle herself

strong performance which get shaded even more a season two unravels and though they thanks to playing character their own age have n't been assaulted with a many question about aging a foster both say

people take you seriously when you 're 'i wonder if you take yourself more seriously when you 're schor agrees 'you do n't give yourself some sort of date 'when i 'm then i 'll have to make these important choice ' then turning to duff 'but i feel like you 've made a lot of important choice in your life that i feel like a lot of people in their twenty have n't gotten to yet 'but what if that screwed up the whole system duff shriek in response 'i 'll be and not be able to make any choice it provokes an interesting question that reinforces the idea that younger is deeper than a charming sitcom about dating may superficially seem in the show liza lie about her age'yes that 's not great'but in doing so she end up living a life that make her happier than she 's been in year decade even without explicitly endorsing that someone in their forty pretend to be year younger younger suggests there may actually be something to learn by embracing at least behavior personality and attitude from that part of a person 's life 'making brave choice or choice that scare you i think you do that a lot more when you 're younger because ' schor say before duff interrupt 'you can fuck up 'exactly you can be forgiven schor continues of course embodying the spirit of a year old is one thing wishing to go back is another 'it is interesting playing this character who get to dress really cool

ally may be exacerbating his problem and opposition by unwittingly dragging him into a long running internal iowa republican civil war the conflict is a fight over the future of the iowa republican party but it may prove decisive in the future of the national party it may even make donald trump the nominee cruz 's newest critic in iowa is none other than iowa governor terry branstad who told reporter after a renewable fuel summit in altoona on tuesday that he hope cruz is defeated in the iowa caucus it 's not often a governor explicitly tell his party to oppose the leading candidate in a primary while cruz 's desire to end the renewable fuel standard ethanol mandate prompted the comment there 's a lot more to this dynamic between branstad and cruz 'it seems like there 's something beyond ethanol that 's animating the issue for him to so directly go after cruz suggested jeff patch an iowa republican operative 'it 's not a big secret that there 's no love loss between branstad and cruz endorser vander plaats and it seems like it 's a broader proxy war for the direction of the republican party in iowa many republican insider view cruz 's role here a yet another chapter in the seven year long saga that includes iowa 's gay marriage ruling congressman steve king religious warrior bob vander plaats a takeover of the state party by ron paul supporter and even sarah palin the current conflict date back to april of when the landmark varnum decision by the state supreme court legalized gay marriage making iowa the first in the midwest to do so that rallied evangelical voter to action who have always held a strong influence in the state meanwhile branstad kicked off his return to politics a he ran for a fifth gubernatorial term his main competition in the primary wa bob vander plaats the head of the family leader a social conservative advocacy group 'vander plaats ran entirely on an executive order to basically tell the iowa supreme court thanks for you opinion but you do n't get to make law recalled craig robinson the editor of theiowarepublican com who ha documented the gop conflict the most 'it would have created a constitutional crisis vander plaats lost to branstad to in the primary but he remained a branstad 's biggest antagonist 'the branstad governing style is to emphasize the economic side while still being socially conservative explained jeff angelo a former republican state senator 'bob vander plaats is definitely a social conservative issue first sort of guy the guy who talk about revival and righteousness and repentance and getting back to god those difference caused multiple flare ups over the year several republican lawmaker backed by vander plaats pushed a 'personhood abortion amendment in the iowa statehouse to the chagrin of party leader the two side clashed in primary with vander plaats candidate winning several state legislative victory while branstad 's team helped joni ernst emerge in the senate primary they fought bitterly over defunding planned parenthood last year a well there wa also a weird ron paul interlude for about two year when backer of paul essentially took over the republican party of iowa 's state central committee and the party headquarters itself the takeover became a disaster a they ran the state party 's finance into the ground and burned bridge with many activist and party leader during that time the vander plaats crowd though not ideologically the same wa happy to assist the people giving branstad fit branstad 's ally made a major push in to fight back and successfully recaptured the state party now vander plaats ha joined congressman steve king and conservative radio talk show host steve deace in endorsing cruz in the iowa caucus 'cruz ha stepped into that role a chief branstad antagonist patch noted of the ten republican operative insider and activist interviewed for this article all believed that the primary cause of branstad 's hit on cruz wa over branstad 's sincere support for ethanol and some pointed out that branstad wa responding to a reporter 's question a opposed to placing the cruz criticism in a speech 'there 's no harder worker for iowa farmer than dad is added eric branstad the governor 's son who is helping run america 's renewable future the pro rf group targeting cruz 'he is seeing the number he is seeing the land value and he is seeing the price of corn a hit to the rf would be a hit to all of those factor so he see this a looking out for iowa that is his sole focus nothing to do with politics but most still felt that long standing frustration with vander plaats helped fuel the division 'i wa very surprised by the personal nature of the attack robinson observed 'those two side never really trust each other in addition to ideological difference branstad loyalist have long viewed vander plaats with a skeptical eye for his personal style they see his family leader organization a bigger on pontificating and raising money than achieving result they believe vander plaats make outrageous statement to attract medium attention so that he can rally donor and vander plaats himself even tried to get nominated a branstad 's lt governor from the state convention floor after losing in the primary a tactic branstad 's team saw a self promotional those concern have emerged this caucus cycle a well steve king 's son is employed by a cruz super pac many allege vander plaats run a pay to play system with his earlier candidate forum saying he only allows question from donor so branstad ha plenty of reason to pressure cruz branstad himself wo n't endorse in the caucus though many see him helping christie behind the scene many of branstad 's former top staffer run christie 's iowa operation bruce rastetter a top branstad ally and wealthy agribusiness leader endorsed christie but speaking out solely against cruz 's campaign is quite the move robinson suggests it may be payback for when vander plaat 's family leader specifically came out against branstad in 'i could see how someone could say this is terry branstad 's revenge robinson said 'he is now anti endorsing a candidate much like that organization did to him will it have an impact cruz ha shrugged off overwhelming criticism in iowa before but eventually it 's going to add up and the main beneficiary very well could be donald trump 'what branstad is doing at least in iowa could potentially benefit trump which a lot of republican in the branstad coalition would not want to help said patch 'i do n't think branstad is doing that on purpose 'in iowa if you want to vote for an anti establishment candidate you could listen to governor branstad and vote for the anti establishment candidate who 's also for the rf angelo concurred 'donald trump wa all over that yesterday actually sarah palin 's endorsement of trump on the same day branstad bashed cruz might have given vander plaats flashback to in vander plaats had the backing of james dobson and chuck norris and wa close to nationalizing his race in a way that could have galvanized tea party supporter to give him the upset over branstad but then palin came and endorsed branstad about a week out from the primary blunting vander plaats ' momentum now he ha to watch a his chosen candidate 's main rival get the palin nod just before the caucus the strategy here could be to damage cruz 's momentum and let trump win then some candidate will drop out after new hampshire and voter could coalesce around one of the more center right or establishment alternative to trump like marco rubio or christie that 's a big risk however and might just end up letting trump cruise to a quick victory iowa ha held a huge role in the presidential process for decade now the choice by the to iowan who show up on a cold caucus night ha determined the eventual nominee for the party several time in it could be a single long standing grudge between the leader of the two major faction of iowa republican that swing the entire race,11165.0

planning my workload for the week 'i want to write something about bowie i thought but i did n't want to write a review maybe something about his impact on me a a music writer maybe something about his decision to withdraw and let his music speak for him in recent year maybe about the value of music 's great enigma i do n't know what i thought i wa going to write exactly but i never thought i 'd be writing about the death of david bowie bowie died late sunday night after an month battle with cancer even after i heard i could n't bring myself to tweet anything remotely close to 'rip david bowie it feel unnatural it feel inadequate it feel wrong for most of my most favorite artist i can recite when they crashed into my world and how i remember the circumstance vividly'like a flash a friend making a mixtape for me in high school made me aware of marvin gaye 's genius almost a decade after his untimely death classic era stevie wonder wa the soundtrack to the summer i turned 'after i 'd bought song in the key of life on a whim i found the beatles through sheer curiosity a year earlier and became the kind of obsessive fan most people hate but there are only two such artist who have immeasurably shaped my perspective a a music fan critic and aficionado for whom i ca n't recount exactly how and why i found them prince and david bowie i 'd heard bowie a a kid during his let 's dance year when single like 'modern love 'china girl and the classic title track were impossible to miss and bowie 's labyrinth era image wa burned into my childhood consciousness he wa after all jareth'the baby stealing goblin king in that famous fantasy from but it wa in my twenty that i really found bowie the only specific i remember wa an ex girlfriend giving me a compilation cd a a random gift but i do n't quite recall when i became committed to understanding david bowie there is something about bowie 's enigmatic persona and creative restlessness that fascinated and intimidated me his earliest year a a somewhat unremarkable late ' s singer songwriter belied the mercurial nature of his muse his first big hit wa the classic novelty 'space oddity and it took a while for him to nail down who he wa a an artist but on the man who sold the world the man more david jones found his persona and his sound drenched in heavier rock sound and buoyed by his collaboration with guitarist mick ronson and producer tony visconti sold the world is also remembered for his appearance on the cover in a dress it wa the beginning of his gender bending public image and also a benchmark for glam rock but bowie wa just getting started he subsequently moved from the grandiosity of hunky dory to the conceptual marvel that is his most iconic album the rise and fall of ziggy stardust and the spider from mar the album made bowie a rock star and his androgynous image took the rebellious long haired aesthetic of the ' s and amplified it tenfold he wa pushing button and tearing down boundary 'i 'm gay he said in a interview with melody maker just before ziggy broke big 'and always have been even when i wa david jones the topic of bowie 's sexuality would be the subject of rumor contradiction and clarification for several year but it ca n't be denied that bowie 's willingness to broach the topic in the still very macho world of mainstream rock wa groundbreaking only five year after homosexuality wa declared no longer illegal in great britain musically he would go on to continue evolving and challenging his audience throughout the s going on one of the great album run in popular music history aladdin sane diamond dog young american station to station low lodger and hero showcase an artist who is creatively restless but never conceptually aimless bowie wa traveling through his own bevy of idea not artistically wandering along the way he gathered an enviable list of collaborator from brian eno to carlos alomar to luther vandross to john lennon to robert fripp he wrote and produced for lou reed mott the hoople and iggy pop he began acting'appearing in film like the man who fell to earth and just a gigolo he also developed a cocaine addiction and made bizarre claim he believed jimmy page wa attempting to posse his soul thought that witch were trying to steal his semen and claimed to see satan in his swimming pool by the mid ' s bowie had gone through the glam rock of ziggy and the soul funk influenced sound of young american on the cusp of his infamous 'berlin trilogy he 'd created his latest character the thin white duke gone were the sly groove and rhythm of young american and station to station gone wa the fire red hair and androgynous makeup and in it place wa a dapper colder more conservative image'like sinatra with a third reich fetish 'you 've got to have an extreme right front come up and sweep everything off it foot and tidy everything up he said in a year later he told cameron crowe during a playboy interview that 'television is the most successful fascist needle to say rock star are fascist too adolf hitler wa one of the first rock star bowie would later say that he wa drug addled and saying ridiculous thing when crowe closed with the question 'do you believe and stand by everything you 've said bowie responded coyly 'everything but the inflammatory remark but when he wa photographed giving what appeared to be a nazi salute his image took another hit and he wa cited a a catalyst for the founding of britain 's rock against racism in 'that did n't happen'i just waved bowie said at the time 'on the life of my child i waved after he 'd moved to west berlin germany in late he 'd learned more directly about racism and fascism and he renounced any interest in nazi imagery 'i wa out of my mind totally completely crazed he told rolling stone in spite of the controversy swirling around the thin white duke the period marked bowie 's most innovative and arguably most influential period from joy division to radiohead the more avant garde industrial and atmospheric leaning of bowie 's 'berlin album low lodger and hero may stand a his most enduring musical legacy even if it wa born of pain 'life in l a had left me with an overwhelming sense of foreboding bowie told uncut year later 'i had approached the brink of drug induced calamity one too many time and it wa essential to take some kind of positive action for many year berlin had appealed to me a a sort of sanctuary like situation bowie 's shift into pop hit in the s wa another unexpected change in both music and persona in a bit of a more polished update on the soul funk of young american bowie worked with producer nile rodgers on the multiplatinum smash let 's dance and collaborated with fellow rock legend like queen and mick jagger the subsequent 'serious moonlight tour further cemented david bowie a a megastar in the age of mtv and it wa my first experience with his music and he wa still willing to push button in interview he spoke candidly about mtv 's lack of support for black artist during an interview with network vj mark goodman in 'there seem to be a lot of black artist making very good video that i 'm surprised are n't being used on mtv bowie said in the interview 'we have to try and do what we think not only new york and los angeles will appreciate but also poughkeepsie or the midwest goodman responded 'pick some town in the midwest which would be scared to death by ' a string of other black face or black music we have to play music we think an entire country is going to like and certainly we 're a rock and roll station 'do n't you think it 's a frightening predicament to be in 'yeah but no le so here than in radio said goodman 'do n't say 'well it 's not me it 's them ' is it not possible it should be a conviction of the station and of the radio station to be fair ' to make the medium more integrated his status a a chart topper and more appearance in major film raised his profile even higher but it wa always clear that bowie would not be boxed in by anything'least of all chart success after ending the s with a few lackluster release he regained his creative muse fronting tin machine for two album before releasing black tie white noise another collaboration with nile rodgers that wa informed by his fascination with soul electronica and hip hop he 'd famously married supermodel iman in and wa living in new york city he would dabble in everything from industrial to drum 'n ' bass music for the remainder of the ' s'as mercurial a ever in his mid fifty after a heart attack in he lowered his profile and his output but his impact wa felt throughout music around the time that bowie wa slowing down i wa beginning to fully appreciate his influence i heard bowie in the melodrama of arcade fire i heard him in the nervous energy of franz ferdinand i heard him in bloc party i heard him in vampire weekend i heard him in janelle monae i heard him in miguel i heard david bowie everywhere i wa glad to hear bowie return to music with 's the next day and blown away by blackstar just two day ago he wa complicated and he wa confusing he wa ever changing and in being such he wa a constant he loomed large even when we barely saw him my appreciation for music and it deconstruction wa infinitely raised by having heard david bowie he inspired me and challenged me to think beyond pop hook and flashy guitar solo he wa a freak and a weirdo and a provocateur and an innovator and an icon even with his mistake i would want to be a creatively bold a david bowie maybe he wa insincere maybe he wa manipulative maybe we should n't believe artist must bare their soul to touch ours i do n't know'even now but i know that i would n't be the appreciator of art and music that i am today without having discovered the genius of david bowie,10701.0

gym participating in a 'dry january saving money or quitting smoking kanye west 's new year 's resolution wa it seems to tweet like there 's no tomorrow and god bless him for it late tuesday night rapper wiz khalifa fired off the following tweet it came in response to kanye changing the name of his upcoming album from swish to wave with wiz claiming that the name 'waves belonged to harlem rapper max b who released a string of coke wave mixtapes before being convicted on charge of aggravated assault felony kidnapping armed robbery and murder he 's currently serving a year prison sentence max b is closely affiliated with fellow new york rapper french montana who is the ex boyfriend of kim 's sister khloe kardashian west paid respect to max b via a tweet and thing seemed to be on ice then early wednesday morning rapper wiz khalifa fired off an innocuous tweet 'hit this kk and become yourself khalifa kush kk is the name of the rapper 's strain of marijuana in a interview he discussed how he ha people grow the strain specifically for him and that same year released a song called 'kk with line like 'i got my own weed sucka so i ai n't got ta hit yours kk are also the initial to kanye 's ultra famous wife kim kardashian so kanye thinking wiz wa tweeting about his beloved wife flew into a twitter rage verbally undressing every facet of the rapper 's existence from his style 'i screen grabbed those pant and sent it to my style team to his music 'no one i know ha ever listened to one of your album all the way through to his jv status 'i am your og and i will be respected a such a large portion of kanye 's ire wa directed at wiz 's ex wife amber rose and their child with kanye tweeting 'you let a stripper trap you and 'i know you mad every time you look at your child that this girl got you for year it should be noted here that kanye wa completely out of line from the get go using the occasion of a terribly misinterpreted tweet to take low blow at wiz 's ex wife and child if anyone said the same about kardashian and north or saint west you can rest assured that kanye would go full bride showing up at wiz 's house in a form fitting yellow and black tracksuit clenching hattori hanzo steel this is n't the first or tenth time kanye ha slut shamed rose whom he dated from to after he spotted her in the music video for ludacris ' 'what them girl like in february of last year kanye appeared on power 's the breakfast club 'she 's just soaking in the moment kanye said of rose 'if kim had dated me when i wanted there would be no amber rose he later doubled down saying he had to take ' shower after dating rose before kim would accept him but the origin of this hip hop imbroglio are hard to define kanye and rose were very hot and heavy during their three year relationship which wa immortalized in a very hot and heavy head licking photo shoot with terry richardson when they split in early kanye went on a self imposed exile to hawaii to work on an album dedicated to rose my beautiful dark twisted fantasy the song 'runaway in particular is seen a an open apology to rose for the way he treated her throughout their relationship 'she find picture in my e mail i sent this bitch a picture of my dick i do n't know what it is with female but i 'm not too good with that shit rap kanye 'see i could have me a good girl and still be addicted to them hoodrats and i just blame everything on you at least you know that 's what i 'm good at rose dealt with the split a bit differently she first engaged in a rebound fling with kardashian 's ex reggie bush and then took to the tabloid to air the couple 's dirty laundry claiming in a number of interview that it wa kanye 's flirting with kim that led to their demise 'kim is one of the main reason why me and kanye are not together rose said in an 'exclusive interview with star magazine 'she 's a homewrecker according to rose kanye and kim were hooking up while she wa still with kanye and kim wa dating nfl running back reggie bush 'they were both cheating said rose 'they were both cheating on me and reggie with each other kim wa sending racy picture and i wa like 'kim just stop do n't be that person ' i thought at least she 'd be woman enough to respond to me she never responded 'i want to thank her rose continued of kim 'because if she wa never a homewrecker then i never would have met wiz khalifa and i would n't be a happy a i am now that interview took place in january and week later a man who claimed to be rose 's former publicist alleged on twitter and facebook that he introduced rose to kanye that rose stole from him and that rose wa planning to steal from kanye blaming the latter revelation for their break up'not kim rose denied the allegation kanye and kim became official in april of that year for the next couple of year the two had reached a gossip column d tente with kanye and kim marrying and having two child and amber and wiz marrying and having one child following rose and wiz 's split in late her beef with kanye reignited in february kim 's little sister kylie jenner began dating the rapper tyga now tyga ha a child with the hip hop model blac chyna who is best friend with rose when the relationship came to light rose went on the breakfast club and blasted it 'kylie 's a baby said rose 'she need to go to bed at o'clock and relax it 's ridiculous tyga should be ashamed of himself that 's how i feel for sure he ha a beautiful woman and a baby that he left for a year old who just turned rose did make some good points'in their home state of california the kylie tyga coupling qualifies a statutory rape the interview prompted kylie 's sister khloe kardashian to fire off a few tweet at rose labeling her a hypocrite for stripping at yet criticizing kylie for her illicit relationship with tyga rose did n't take the criticism lying down and decided to drag kim'and by extension kanye'into the mix kanye 's infamous ' shower interview on the breakfast club wa in response to this tweet by rose and if that were n't enough in recent week rose 's pal and tyga 's ex blac chyna ha began dating rob kardashian the semi estranged brother of kylie kim khloe and co it 's hard to determine who 's more at fault here if kanye cheated on her rose ha a right to be upset but it 's been six year since they 've split the two have both moved on and started separate family yet rose who is mostly famous due to her association with kanye seems to keep tethering herself to kanye and the kardashians for the considerable ink it generates and the same go for blac chyna tyga and the kardashians the best thing kanye can do is ignore them entirely but he 's never been one to take an insult lying down when rose caught wind of the recent kanye wiz spat and the insult he threw her way she went for the jugular a long a there 's ink to be spilled and gossip column to be filled do n't expect this feud to die down anytime soon rose 's celebrity depends

catching the interested stare from both girl and boy at the bar and getting into trouble with the law the lady and the lord all at the same time'you 'll have a pretty good idea of how fox 's new tv show lucifer begin that 's right america'fox is bringing a show about satan to primetime nobody 's shocked really this is a network owned by a company that for year ha enabled the public with nightly dos of bill o'reilly moreover some americans'likely bill o'reilly fans'have long decried fox a one of the devil 's network suggesting that show like family guy and or glee to be the feces of satan of course it 's obvious why fox is taking a chance on lucifer like the network 's semi hit show gotham the lead character is derived from a dc comic series a trend that a lot of networks'from netflix to the cw'are following banking huge budget on show adapted from comic book character in lucifer the devil incarnate is loosely based on 'lucifer morningstar 'a character that debuted in dc comic ' the sandman in and later headlined it own eponymously titled series in fox 's version of lucifer an hourlong dramedy that star whale native tom elli a the charming prince of semi darkness satan is a bored uninspired and likable supernatural human who without giving notice decides to take a leave of absence from hell and search for a little excitement in la within the first few minute of the fox planned episode arc we learn that lucifer is not only a smooth talking well dressed smarta with a penchant for cracking punch line and quipping smartly worded comeback he 's also a self identifying victim'somebody who think he 's been abused by god since the beginning of time this fact is delivered when lucifer get a surprise visit from amenadiel another angelic creature who ha just flown in from heaven with a message for lucifer from god'go back to hell immediately side note the role of amenadiel is played by d b woodside whom you might remember played 'wayne palmer one of the former president of the united state from and guess what in lucifer woodside look exactly like 's former potus except he 's donning enormous angel wing sadly though he wa impressive playing a president here a an angel with huge wing woodside come off a uncomfortable at best however during their conversation lucifer refers to himself a a 'mere pawn one who is only filling the role of an 'inherently evil antagonist in a play written and directed by 'dear ole dad which is how lucifer refers to god through a series of event lucifer eventually realizes that nabbing criminal brings him a certain amount of solace even joy'and to that end he start helping the lapd catch bad guy that at least according to the first episode will become an ongoing weekly gig for our villain or is it hero 'it 's hard to know really honestly there 's a lot to like about lucifer'it 's sharply written and except for woodside 's angel is well casted and elli 's delivery a satan is quite good in fact maybe too good in episode lucifer is way too much of a good guy at times'he cry he second guess heck he even feel mercy a likable satan is n't a bad idea in fact most people'even those who believe in satan'would be okay with satan being a likable villain but that uncertainty'whether hell 's onetime overseer is good bad or cute and lovable'might ultimately become the show 's fall from grace a one might expect lucifer 's 'good guy storyline ha sparked a good bit of backlash from several large christian group including the american family association afa and one million mom not only have both organization initiated online campaign against lucifer asking fox to remove it from it schedule they 've also actively campaigned against the show on social medium that said fox likely is n't listening to the faith based noise since marketing this show to christian would be rather fruitless however oddly enough fox might end up needing to pay attention to the complaint of those christian mom because they 're honestly not wrong about lucifer in fact the reason why those one million mom or just mom a is the case on facebook are currently decrying the show might become the same reason the network 's target demographic loses interest'because lucifer is too pretty too human too conscientious too much like robin hood and while walking that good bad line work for a variety of other character i 'm just not sure that a sincerely good satan is a sellable concept for the long haul in fact even before it debut the show 's facebook page ha garnered several comment from concerned potential viewer about lucifer 's good guy persona one of the show 's fan put it like this 'i am definitely tuning in for the start of the season but if the show is going to make lucifer a naughty good boy instead of a charming evil i am not interested ironically lucifer might end up being 'too good for people who have no interest in watching and 'not bad enough for those who do,39479.0

cyber attack on the ukrainian power grid last month multiple source familiar with the investigation told the daily beast computer security expert at the central intelligence agency the national security agency and the homeland security department are examining sample of malicious software recovered from the network of a power company in western ukraine which said on december that a large area of the country had been left without electricity due to 'interference in it system approximately home were without power for several hour if the blackout is positively attributed to the work of hacker it will be the first documented case of a cyber attack on an electrical power facility that led to a loss of electricity while hacker are suspected of having caused a blackout at least once in the past there ha never been a publicly confirmed case with tehnical data to back it up 'it is a milestone john hultquist the director of cyber espionage analysis at computer security company isight partner which is analyzing hacking tool used in the intrusion told the daily beast a confirmed cyber attack that caused a power outage would put pressure on president obama to speak publicly about the event and say whether russia wa to blame in obama publicly identified north korea a the culprit in a cyber attack on sony picture entertainment that destroyed company property and exposed private communication of executive obama ordered sanction on north korea and u s government hacker attacked key portion of north korea 's fragile internet in response spokesperson for the cia and the homeland security department declined to comment for this article a spokesperson for the national security agency did n't respond to a request for comment the ukrainian government ha publicly blamed russia for the attack the attack in ukraine could be a bad omen for the u s power grid malicious software that wa found on the network of the company prykarpattyaoblenergo wa also used in a campaign targeting power facility in the u s in it caused no damage but it set off alarm across the security and intelligence agency at the time the homeland security department warned company about the malware known a blackenergy which it said had been used in a hacking campaign that 'comprised numerous industrial control system environment ' industrial control system are used to regulate the flow of electricity and to remotely control critical system at power facility security expert have warned for year that they could be commandeered via the internet and give a hacker the ability to turn off electricity to whole city 'if you 're connected you 're likely infected the department warned in another bulletin to power company in the spring of urging them to disconnect any control system that were still connected to the internet in light of the blackenergy threat attack that cause loss of electrical power on a large scale are one of a handful of nightmare scenario that u s national security official have been trying to ensure do n't come to pas in america they fear that city could go without power for month or even week if equipment that generates or distributes electricity were taken offline and could n't be quickly replaced among the question the u s government analyst want to answer in the ukrainian case is how exactly the hacker were able to penetrate the company 's system and whether they were acting on behalf of the government in moscow or with it implied consent there is no doubt multiple expert said that the blackenergy malware that ha been linked to intrusion into power facility in the u s wa found in the ukrainian company 's system but u s and corporate analyst are proceeding cautiously given the momentousness of the event and the geopolitical implication of the russian government 's involvement or complicity in an historic act of aggression they 're also aware of the fact that most power outage in the u s ultimately attributed to natural cause such a storm and overgrown tree limb and that for all the hand wringing about cyber attack on the grid there ha never been a proven instance an outage in brazil that wa attributed to hacker wa later said to be caused by dirty equipment expert in government and at at least three security company are still compiling technical data that would show conclusively that the blackout wa the result of a malicious cyber attack and not some other factor such a human error or a mechanical failure but something close to a consensus view that the power outage wa deliberately caused wa forming among independent analyst on tuesday isight a well security company eset have linked the blackout to hacker and the sans institute a respected research group that train u s government security expert while not conclusively identifying the cause of the blackout said in a blog post last week 'the ukrainian power outage is more likely to have been caused by a cyber attack than previously thought hultquist of isight said the hacker were likely part of a group that the company dubbed sandworm and that it tracked in during the probe of u s power facility that prompted the government warning 'i believe at the time they were preparing for an escalating event with u s and europe hultquist said it 's still not clear why the hacker did n't follow through and cause a power outage but hultquist described their probe a a 'reconnaissance mission that would give them the lay of the land should they have chosen to launch an assault russian hacker have been blamed for cyber attack in the past including against pentagon network last year in an apparent attempt to steal military secret given that russia ha demonstrated both the will and the expertise to use cyber attack u s official are paying especially close attention to the event in ukraine 'i 'm confident they and the ukrainian government have a lot of data and a lot of technical evidence that 's not yet public robert m lee the founder and ceo of dragos

left white dead sending a shockwave of violent resistance across the country three decade before slavery would be abolished for good in america the film earned it first standing ovation before it even played a the audience inside sundance 's eccles theater rose to their foot for parker the great debater and beyond the light star had spent seven year trying to get the movie made while hollywood told him no at every turn he put of his own money into the making of the film and put his acting career on hold secured investment from a passel of investor including nba all star michael finley san

begged he added 'the reality is that these distributor are all at the highest level and they all can achieve what you need after hearing the common refrain during his fight to get the birth of a nation made that movie with black lead do n't travel a key incentive in fox searchlight 's bid wa the promise of international exposure 'for me i wa looking for human connection parker explained 'i wa looking for someone who understood the global rollout someone that understood that the message this film give is not just one that 's domestic but one that can translate abroad anywhere'the message of freedom the message of confronting injustice with resistance those early morning conversation also indicated to parker that a sea change is coming in hollywood a the door open for minority voice that have been taught to believe their goal are impossible 'as the bid rose i thought to myself 'people are ready ' said parker 'all that i heard about the self perpetuating idea that people were not interested in story that dealt with our past with respect to slavery that they may not be interested in the heart of this movie and the subject matter'all those thing went out the window and those thing are very real tangible obstacle 'it wa such an arduous experience putting this thing together he continued 'there were so many time when i wa wondering how i would get it done and then when i got it done if people would respond would they be open to this idea of healing through honest confrontation with our past in the birth of a nation parker confronts nearly two hundred year in the telling of turner 's history itself the subject of controversy for example plantation owner samuel turner played by armie hammer is written a a composite of two men the real life turner who died in and joseph travis the subsequent owner whose family nat turner and his men killed at the start of their rebellion parker made the deliberate choice to rewrite an even more significant chapter in turner 's life history'based on william styron 's book the confession of nat turner itself based on the firsthand account of turner 's remark by thomas ruffin gray'has long held that turner after hiding for month following the attack wa discovered by a local hunter captured and eventually executed parker 's version give turner a hero 's ending a the morally impassioned man of god turn himself in to stop the retaliatory killing of black that ensued in the insurrection 's aftermath 'as you can imagine during this time white supremacy wa the rule racism wa the rule all the people who wrote the journalist and the scientist everyone wa complicit there wa no clear and definitive piece of fact that i could lean on and say 'this is what it wa ' he said 'there is so much controversy around the confession of nat turner because the man who conducted this interview wa a slave owning lawyer who wa also a gambler who had come up on hard time parker continued 'he had every motivation to fabricate the thing that were said you read writer respond or people who speak on the confession whether it 's styron or gray and they tell you that all of the critical information that wa contained in those confession could have been found anywhere'that they were common knowledge 'there 's so much conflicting information around certain area that i felt it necessary a a black man who is not infected with white supremacy or any racial ideology to say where this fall short with enough substantial evidence i would say in my mind it 's completely conceivable that this revolutionary would have turned himself in knowing that people were getting killed all over the county and all over the country a the oscarssowhite debate reach a fever pitch in hollywood parker deftly maneuver around the immediate question on academy award boycott and membership quota and take a macro position on racial bias and representation in the entertainment industry 'what i 'd like to do with my art is challenge hollywood a a whole he offered 'the reality is that we 're built on shaky ground d w griffith 's the birth of a nation film really put u in a tough spot with regard to race relation he had this film that basically created this mantra that white should embrace white supremacy a a mean of self preservation he wa considered a genius for his technique and this film became the leading projector of social thought and of cinematic thought and that is the foundation we 're built on 'we can deal with the branch or we can deal with the root he said borrowing a line turner utters in the film a he entreats his compatriot to fall back under assault to regroup and think strategically 'i think that it 's easy to isolate incident and it 's harder to roll up our sleeve and get our hand dirty he said 'as filmmaker people of color and people that are not of color should really be critical of hollywood be critical of society when it come to the pervasiveness of racism that we 're surrounded by that we breathe in and out every day racism and violence of course remains pervasive and troubling tied up in infrastructure of power what message doe turner 's story of violent righteous resistance send to today 's america 'if it sends a message it say 'use the tool that you have ' parker answered 'nat turner all he had were ax and broom handle he did n't have gun he did n't have the right to assembly he did n't have the right to leave his plantation he did n't control his own body he had tool in front of him and he tried to deal with evil and the injustice around him in the only way that wa available to him the reality is if nat turner had twitter and facebook and instagram then maybe it would have been a different type of revolution but that 's what he had 'i think that what he represents is having a riotous disposition toward injustice added parker 'that doe n't mean that in i 'm going to go and axe someone i do n't have to that would n't be practical but it doe mean that a a filmmaker i can use my weapon of film to project my perspective onto the world hopefully for the mean of my message which is to inspire change,21120.0

classified information to his biographer and mistress while he wa still in uniform three people with knowledge of the matter told the daily beast the decision now rest with secretary of defense ash carter who is said to be willing to consider overruling an earlier recommendation by the army that petraeus not have his rank reduced such a demotion could cost the storied general hundred of thousand of dollars'and deal an additional blow to his once pristine reputation the secretary is considering going in a different direction from the army a defense official told the daily beast because he want to be consistent in his treatment of senior officer who engage in misconduct and to send a message that even men of petraeus ' fame and esteemed reputation are not immune to punishment pentagon spokesperson peter cook told the daily beast that carter had requested more information on the matter before reaching a final decision the department of the army is still in the process of providing the secretary with information relevant to former ' secretary mchugh 's recommendation cook told the daily beast referring to ex army secretary john mchugh who had recommended taking no action against petraeus 'once the secretary ' ha an opportunity to consider this information he will make his decision about next step if any in this matter carter could also recommend other action that do n't result in petraeus losing his fourth star or the defense secretary could simply allow the army 's previous recommendation to stand petraeus arguably the most well known and revered military officer of his generation retired from the army in with the rank of a four star general the highest rank an army officer can achieve if carter decides to strip petraeus of his fourth star he could be demoted to the last rank at which he 'satisfactorily served according to military regulation reducing petraeus ' rank most likely to lieutenant general could mean he 'd have to pay back the difference in pension payment and other benefit that he received a a retired four star general that would amount to hundred of thousand of dollar over his retirement according to pentagon figure a four star general with roughly the same year of experience a petraeus wa entitled to receive a yearly pension of nearly a three star officer would receive about petraeus did n't respond to a request for comment but the financial pain to petraeus is n't likely to be severe he ha confided to friend and acquaintance that he 's making a hefty sum from his job at a private equity firm and through speaking fee the demotion in rank would be a bigger lasting blow and take from petraeus the rare achievement he 'd set his eye on many year ago at any given time there are only four star general in the army the largest of the service by the time he wa a colonel in the mid s many thought petraeus wa destined to be one of them the u s military ha on several occasion demoted general increasingly for improper personal contact and not for poor battlefield decision but rarely doe it demote four star general in part because there are so few of them it 's also more common to reduce the rank of more junior officer than of top general if petraeus were demoted it would mark another spectacular fall petraeus stepped down a director of the central intelligence agency in after his affair with paula broadwell a writer and current army reservist wa revealed at the time petraeus had been frequently mentioned a a possible republican presidential candidate in petraeus pleaded guilty last year to giving broadwell eight notebook that he compiled while serving a commander of u s force in afghanistan and that he knew contained classified information the notebook held some of the most sensitive kind of military and intelligence secret including the identity of covert officer intelligence capability quote from high level meeting of the national security council and note about petraeus ' discussion with president obama after leaving afghanistan petraeus brought the book back to his home in virginia and gave them to broadwell just three day before he retired from the army she later returned them no classified information appeared in her biography all in the education of general david petraeus official have said petraeus could have faced felony charge including for lying to fbi investigator but wa allowed to plead guilty last year to a misdemeanor count of unauthorized handling classified information he avoided and avoid a prison sentence and received two year probation and a fine but that wa not the end of the matter last year the fbi gave army investigator information that the bureau had come across a it wa closing up it own investigation of petraeus the defense official and one former u s official told the daily beast the information the fbi believed might be of interest to the army the defense official said the army investigated and decided there wa nothing new here that should change his retirement and recommended that there be no change to his four star rank the official said last month it went to the secretary of defense for final approval army personnel regulation say that an officer doe n't automatically retire with the highest rank he or she achieved while in uniform and even though petraeus had already been officially retired through a process known a grade determination the army can retroactively reopen his case and consider whether to demote him ' i f substantial new evidence discovered contemporaneously with or within a short time following separation could result in a lower grade determination the regulation also state that if 'an officer 's misconduct while still on active duty is documented including by 'conviction after retirement a new grade determination may be completed petraeus had n't yet retired when he gave broadwell the classified information the army received the information from the fbi that prompted this new review more than four year after petraeus had retired the defense department wa also running it own investigation into petraeus ' relationship with broadwell and what classified information he gave her at the same time the fbi and federal prosecutor were pursuing their case that may explain why the army decided it had seen nothing new in the information it received last year from the fbi and decided not to recommend a demotion but carter is said to be concerned that because he ha recommended other general be reduced in rank for action not becoming an officer he 'll be seen a inconsistent if he doe n't do the same for petraeus the decision is a much about timing and politics a it is petraeus ' own transgression this is about ash carter not david petraeus the defense official said last november carter removed his senior military aide lt gen ron lewis for personal misconduct and referred the matter to the pentagon 's inspector general for investigation lewis wa demoted a rank to a major general lewis wa a long time and influential aide to the secretary and his removal and punishment signaled carter 's commitment to maintaining upstanding behavior among of the military 's general the exact nature of lewis ' misconduct ha not been announced but military official have suggested he wa involved in an improper personal relationship while few are familiar with petraeus ' potential demotion those who are aware of it said they were surprised that he could be punished year year after the scandal wa presumably put behind him and after petraeus pleaded guilty to mishandling classified information no general in recent history ha been demoted year after scandal swirled around him or her those who know and have worked with petraeus describe him a a man of extraordinary capability and ambition he received his fourth star in and then served in several prestigious and demanding assignment including commander of u s central command the commanding general of all ground force in iraq and later a commander of ground force in afghanistan petraeus ' unorthodox thinking and willingness to buck conventional strategy wa seen a key to the u s victory over insurgent and jihadist in iraq during the so called troop surge of and his reputation wa so esteemed that there wa talk of giving him a fifth star a largely symbolic gesture that wa highly unlikely or renaming the road to petraeus ' alma mater the u s military academy after him should carter choose to knock petraeus down to the rank of a three star general he will have a chance to appeal his case to the secretary but congress doe n't have to be informed of the decision the official said there is no deadline on carter to make a decision the last commander to lose rank for professional misconduct wa

upcoming uk film ha left fan of the late king of pop in a state of bewilderment and shock with many airing their grievance on social medium fiennes will co star a jackson in a movie titled elizabeth michael marlon set to premiere later this year the film is a comedic retelling of a fabled story involving the king of pop elizabeth taylor and marlon brando on a road trip from new york city to los angeles on september acclaimed actor stockard channing and brian cox a taylor and brando respectively are so pitch perfectly cast that neither requires much if any further explanation but fiennes a jackson is a whole different story altogether fiennes spoke about the bizarre project and acknowledged that playing the megastar jackson would be 'a challenge the shakespeare in love actor also discussed the tone of this bizarre comedy based on a disputed vanity fair story about the trio of legend who unable to secure a flight out of new york on took their show on the road 'i got the script the other day fiennes explained to wenn 'it 's a challenge it 's a comedy it doe n't poke mean fun but it 's a story possibly urban legend whereby michael marlon brando and liz taylor were all together the day before doing a concert airspace wa shut down and they could n't get out and michael had the bright idea to go to hire a car and drive 'so the three of them got in a car and drove mile to los angeles it took them a while because they had to stop at a lot of burger king for marlon but they got out fiennes did n't much however to address the pound elephant no not brando in the room why wa a white actor cast to play an african american entertainer even one with jackson 's specific physical attribute at that point in his life'he suffered from vitiligo which cause the skin to lose their pigment'it 's not beyond reason to consider that there are qualified black actor out there that could convincingly portray michael jackson one ha to wonder if there is all that much consideration given to getting this 'right at all especially when considering these industry ' inherent preference for white face to sell of course this latest bit of questionable casting come in the midst of a highly visible dialogue on race in mainstream cinema the lack of diversity among this year 's academy award nominee ha led to a revamp of the voting system and of the academy itself a well a a much larger conversation on opportunity in front of and behind the camera throughout the many tier of hollywood while brit charlotte rampling and michael caine shrugged off the oscarssowhite campaign rampling even said it wa 'racist against white uk star elba recently spoke to the house of parliament regarding the lack of varied opportunity for non white actor in british entertainment and how it affected him both a a black fan and a a black actor 'because i never saw myself on tv i stopped watching tv he said 'instead i decided to just go out and become tv 'there wa n't enough imagination in the industry for me to be seen a a lead elba said 'when you do n't reflect the real world too much talent get trashed thrown on the scrapheap talent is everywhere opportunity is n't and talent ca n't reach opportunity elba also shared his belief that hollywood wa far ahead of the uk regarding opportunity for people of color 'i went to america because i wa running out of part he said 'the usa ha the most famous diversity policy of all the american dream i want that british dream if hollywood is the standard bearer for opportunity then we should all be deeply concerned about the state of diversity in the film industry that is n't intended to be glib but to convey the gravity of the problem how deeply we must go to uproot and rectify it there is both a casual ambivalence and quiet hostility towards broadening the range of opportunity for non white star to truly thrive in the mainstream and thing like casting a white man to play michael jackson only serve a further proof that there are filmmaker who are deeply determined to tune out the cultural conversation british actor and son of anarchy star charlie hunnam wa announced a the lead in the upcoming american drug lord the story of mexican american edgar valdez villarreal who went from texas high school football star to brutal cartel leader known a 'la barbie villareal 's nickname wa attributed to the fact that he had blue eye and a fair complexion 'like a ken doll 'it seems not well thought through to be upset over casting an excellent actor to act a a character with whom he seems to share many physical resemblance argued producer vincent newman 'i suppose those offended by this would have disqualified al pacino from acting a tony montana or james caan a sonny corleone it 's acting after all and the merit of the choice will be assessed a it is with all casting choice on the quality and believability of his performance pacino 's famously over the top faux cubano scarface shtick is n't exactly the best performance to cite a far a white actor tackling 'ethnic character but when there is already evidence of clear racial bias in which actor are even considered for role in the first place it should be clear why casting fiennes a the famously pale jackson or hunnam a la barbie raise question how many actually black or latino actor had the opportunity to land these role how many producer already know from the first reading of the script that they would prefer to cast white guy who look like non white guy a opposed to proper black latino lead these are question that recognize how racial bias in casting green lighting and marketing film are a detrimental a flagrant racist contempt and long after award season ha passed we 'll be left to answer these question if we are committed to addressing the disparity that lead to white guy deciding who and what go onscreen joseph fiennes a michael jackson is a symptom of a deeper sickness that moviemakers are only now beginning to treat this movie wo n't be the final say on this subject but a it happens it add fuel to a very necessary conversation here 's hoping major film studio in both america and britain pay closer attention to that conversation and do more than pay lip service to those initiating it and here 's hoping we do n't get a ralph fiennes cameo a jermaine,91623.0

something because it 's unexpected i would do it if i met somebody i think i wa pairing the showcase of it the whole pageantry of wedding with commitment rather than realizing they could become two separate thing not that she 's aggressively in the market for someone now 'my mind 's not even there lately she say 'when you do something like these project that are so fulfilling i 'm like 'ok what can we do next ' my friend are like 'do you want to meet this guy ' and i 'm like 'not really ' if i 'm going to meet them i 'll meet them when i 'm supposed to she let out a big laugh 'like all of a

into one of the most recognizable figure in hollywood and over the course of seven year and more than episode eventually made her miserable 'i did n't want to be there she begin saying that it wa around the fifth year of chelsea lately that she ran out of enthusiasm 'everyone wa annoying me my staff wa fighting about who wa going to be on air all the time they were catty i wa like 'this is so childish ' still a sense of responsibility for the staff she employed even if they got on her nerve guilted her in a way into keeping the show running'until she realized how ridiculous it wa to make decision based on that 'so i think the last go round i did n't even really decide she say 'i just said it on howard stern like 'yeah i guess i 'm not going to do that again ' and i figured that since i had thought it i had already said it former staff member have said they were blindsided by the announcement 'i wa just like 'that 's a wrap on this ' chelsea doe serf a bridge between what she used to do on chelsea lately and her new show that will debut on netflix later this year 'it 's not going to be a talk show that you usually see she say apologizing that netflix ha forbidden her from revealing more specific detail 'it 's not going to be a late night show i 'm done with that i 'm not doing that again and at the very least chelsea doe prof that anyone who judged handler based on the celebrity focus of chelsea lately ha been underestimating what she 's capable of 'i hope so she say 'i think i underestimate myself a she tell it each phase her career seems accidental but each memory is accompanied with a quip about what hard work it wa when i start something new i 'm like 'i wonder if i can write a book ' alright let 's do that she say 'i wonder if i can write another one ' let 's do it and i also kind of feel like the book stuff i 'm done with right now i do n't care about that stand up i 'm done with been there done that i 've done a much a you can do a a stand up and i

to understanding chelsea handler when she wa handler 's brother died while he wa hiking the grand teton a formative experience for the baby of family and something that over the year fiercely bonded the handler together then in handler lost her mother rita to a battle with breast cancer 'i grew up at that moment handler say she returned from her book tour in london to be by her ailing mother 's

african ebony it 's got gorgeous bearclaw sitka spruce from vancouver island on top flamed south american mahogany for the neck binding made from hawaiian curly koa and a nut and saddle carved out of ivory from a fossilized mammoth tusk or how about the design covering the back of the m k and spilling around to the fretboard is an impossibly ornate mural featuring a menagerie of elephant monkey bushy tree a marching band in mid song and a winding river complete with waterfall'all of which is painstakingly brought to life by more than hand cut piece of mother of pearl and abalone in the right light the entire back of the guitar glitter no matter how you slice it the m k is a wholly unique guitar that took year to build and that will never exist again and it 's for sale i think the brain behind this musical marvel is year old canadian david iannone it all started back in when he realized his one man shop morgan guitar wa fast approaching it th guitar iannone started building guitar in the early ' s a an apprentice under legendary builder jean larriv e whose handiwork you may recognize from the video for astronaut chris hadfield 's cover of 'space oddity performed aboard the international space station in iannone decided to make a go of it himself and he 's spent his day in happy solitude ever since building handcrafted acoustic guitar out of the multi chambered custom built studio attached to his north vancouver home over the year iannone ha built guitar for local star and enthusiastic amateur alike the blue musician jim byrnes and folk rock band spirit of the west both use morgan guitar so doe sarah mclachlan and a iannone 's reputation ha spread so too have his instrument today he ha dealer in germany japan south korea and the netherlands and individual buyer come through his website from all around the world the internet iannone acknowledges ha led to a surge of start up guitar builder a formerly closely guarded information on technique and material is now all in the public domain but he distinguishes himself in one key way 'you ca n't buy experience iannone say 'and i 've got a hell of a lot of it it 's become unofficial tradition for iannone to build special custom guitar to mark milestone in his career to celebrate morgan 's th anniversary there wa a set of ten guitar made of quilted sapele with bearclaw spruce top for last year 's th iannone made a special one time piece featuring an image of morgan horses'one of the inspiration for the company name'scrimshawed directly onto a piece of inlaid shell on the headstock the m k however is on a whole different level iannone started planning for it year before guitar number wa actually ready to be built he squirreled away especially rare material a he found them and spent month going back and forth with his long time artistic collaborator patrick pothier fine tuning every element of the design pothier himself actually appears in the final mural a doe iannone'the former helping his wife step out of a dory the latter entertaining a monkey sitting on his workbench the process did n't get any easier when it wa time to actually put it all together iannone went through saw blade cutting the requisite amount of pearl once cut each piece wa then numbered and stored in one of many carefully labelled envelope 'it 's like a house if you do n't spend proper time on the foundation you 're asking for trouble iannone say 'but this wa so well designed we took our time to help take the pressure off he only allowed himself to work on this massive anniversary project outside of regular business hour 'i felt like my labour wa free after dinner finally after two year of burning the midnight oil the m k wa finished in the asking retail price forty thousand dollar canadian approximately usd to be fair there are more expensive guitar out there in fact just last year guinness world record officially bestowed that honour on a white diamond encrusted gibson sg valued at some million usd but it 's the m k 's combination of rare and valuable material it obsessive attention to detail and the fact that it 's a one off piece'not part of a larger run'that really elevates it to a class of it own despite all the extra work that go into them iannone sell each of his milestone guitar just like any other'these one to collector typically for iannone the process of creation is what really matter everything after that is out of his hand 'if you paint a painting you sell it and what happens happens he say by way of comparison 'some of them are preserved forever and some get lost in a fire once they 're out of your space they 're gone still thing are a little different with the m k despite being finished and ready to go it ha sat in iannone 's studio for the past seven year untouched on a storage rack inside a nondescript case and not for lack of interest either iannone say he 's had several offer over the year but for one reason or another they 've all fallen through for a while it wa on display in a glass case in a local vancouver guitar store which briefly caught the eye of a local collector today the m k is listed on the morgan guitar website but without much fanfare next to a bunch of other far cheaper model it come down to this after spending so many hour on the m k slaving over every tiny detail iannone find himself reluctant to sell it in a way it 's hard to blame him he want to make sure the guitar will go to a home where it will be taken care of and appreciated but who could possibly appreciate the m k a much a it creator doe who else could spot all the minute reference or understand the significance of that little pearl iannone figure handing a ball'or is it a piece of food'to the monkey perched on his workbench on those rare occasion iannone doe take the m k out of it case even he still seems amazed that it exists at all 'now i look it and go 'i do n't know how i ever did this ' he say 'i ca n't imagine doing it again the amount of work the focus on this piece'i think it 's probably my masterpiece but if anyone is interested he say he 's still taking offer in the meantime there are always more guitar to build in fact iannone work at such a clip that he 's already fast approaching his th guitar another milestone to be commemorated with another special project right now he 's still sketching idea for the artwork for that one iannone 's thinking goose michael hingston is a writer and novelist based in edmonton alberta canada his work ha appeared in wired salon and the globe and mail,22956.0

peeved at the hawkeye state kingmaker in fact considerable daylight between him and his favored presidential candidate ha some iowan calling flip flop vander plaats ' chosen candidate espouses a view on marriage that vander plaats himself ardently criticized in previous election cycle that candidate ted cruz hold that state should have the power to define marriage while vander platts belief there should be a federal effort to ban gay marriage in the past vander plaats ha compared that stance to defending jim crow but in to the surprise of many he seems totally fine with it it 's a tension that irks operative and confuses activist and it show just how complicated the marriage issue ha become for conservative traditionalist same sex marriage ha n't taken up much oxygen in this republican primary while most of the country including most young republican is fine with it a powerful sector of the republican base still steadfastly opposes it and chief among those is bob vander plaats who head a group called the iowa family leader you may not know much about bob if you do n't follow iowa presidential primary politicking you 'd have little reason to but over the past few election cycle he 's emerged a one of the most powerful power broker in one of the most powerful state conservative candidate fight hard for his endorsement because he helm an energetic network of grassroots volunteer and since the iowa caucus are among the most complex political contest in the u s organized activism is everything so he 's a big deal and ride or die no exception opposition to gay marriage is his signature cause it 's so important to him in fact that he compared the iowa supreme court 's decision legalizing same sex marriage to the dred scott decision he then spearheaded successful effort in to vote out three of the justice who voted for it in a push to ouster a fourth failed 'i think it will send a message across the country that power resides with the people he said at the time 'it 's 'we the people ' not 'we the court ' but his reach ha limit in he took on longtime iowa pol terry branstad in the state 's gubernatorial primary he made his campaign practically single issue on marriage and he lost despite defeat his clout with iowa conservative did n't wane in the republican presidential primary his group drafted a marriage vow that candidate had to sign if they wanted to be considered a potential endorsees signatory promised a 'steadfast embrace of an amendment to the constitution to ban same sex marriage vow signer also promised ' r ejection of shariah islam and to protect woman and child from 'all form of pornography and prostitution only rick santorum rick perry and michele bachmann signed on santorum went on to nab vander plaats ' endorsement and win the iowa caucus it wa n't vander plaats ' first time using the golden touch vander plaats wa the state chairman for gov mike huckabee 's presidential bid when the governor won the caucus central to vander plaats ' approach is the belief that gay marriage must be stopped in the u s no excuse no exception no nonsense during the contest his group explicitly ruled out backing ron paul due to his stance that individual state should be able to decide whether or not to recognize same sex union 'the stumbling block for the board regarding representative paul dealt primarily with 'states ' right ' a it pertains to the sanctity of human life and god 's design for marriage it said in a press release in vander plaats ' thinking giving state the right to recognize same sex marriage wa akin to letting them make their own call on slavery or abortion totally unacceptable now though thing seem a little different and some of vander plaats ' old ally are a little baffled that 's because vander plaats opted to endorse ted cruz cruz of course is no ally of marriage equality the texas senator iterates and reiterates and re reiterates that he personally opposes gay marriage but his official stance is that state should be able to make their own decision on the issue 'he belief that since the constitution doe not mention marriage the definition of marriage is up to the state emailed campaign spokesman rick tyler in barney frank praised cruz 's view a 'an evolution on the issue that is n't what vander plaats belief it also is n't what mike huckabee and rick santorum believe both back a constitutional amendment to limit marriage right to heterosexual couple thus vander plaats back a candidate who hold a position on marriage that he himself said wa disqualifying in 'bob is a good guy but like most power broker endorsement his decision are based on politics more than principle said jesse benton paul 's campaign chair in 'dr paul wa percent committed to principle and many found no political advantage in supporting him ted cruz is much more compromising and acceptable to the establishment so power broker are happy to manipulate their own rule to give him an advantage and gain access to to him benton is n't the only one who say vander plaats is being inconsistent drew ivers a former finance chairman for the iowa republican party said vander plaats and cruz share a biblical view of marriage but he added that vander plaats seems to have shifted his stance 'he is flipping in that he 's abandoning his support of a federal marriage amendment whereas before that wa his main thrust ivers said and one iowa conservative evangelical activist who volunteered on vander plaats ' gubernatorial campaign said she wa stunned that he backed cruz 'he 's a very strong defender of traditional marriage she said 'and always on the state ' right position he wa adamantly against it he always quoted abraham lincoln state do n't have the right to do wrong 'it 's confusing she said of the cruz endorsement another long time grassroots evangelical activist echoed that frustration 'it 's kind of a head scratcher trying to figure it out he said 'of all of the candidate all of the choice out there why would you pick cruz of all people 'a lot of people i know have wondered the same thing he continued 'what 's this all about is there some kind of a pre planned strategy that we do n't know about or something behind the scene it 's like he 's either completely changed his view on it or something i do n't really know vander plaats ' group did n't respond to a request for comment on whether he 's flip flopped on the issue but for many conservative iowan his comment wo n't matter vander plaats viewed by outsider a a titan of purity ha caved,7108.0

generous helping of both set in the mythical town of mexifornia located on the u s mexico border the series'which air sunday at pm'deals with the interplay between two family the buchwalds and the gonzalezes reside next door to one another but a we soon see they live a world apart starting with head of household bud buchwald is a border patrol agent and ernesto gonzalez is a mexican immigrant bud 's daughter becky is dating ernesto 's nephew 'jc 'an americanized abbreviation of juan carlos and voter have approved an anti immigrant 'show me your paper ordinance because a bud put it 'it 's about time we did something about immigration the southwest belongs to meth lab entrepreneur and retired art teacher you might want to take a look at the deed to that property bud the southwest once belonged to mexico and mexican immigrant are reclaiming it'one hardscrabble success story at a time delivering funny gag and clever dialogue with the subtlety of an obama immigration raid the series'which wa created by family guy writer mark hentemann and executive produced by family guy creator seth macfarlane'is already generating plenty of buzz in the latino community in fact people were talking about this show month before the first episode aired part of the reason for the high level of interest is that while latinos'particularly those in my parent ' generation which grew up in the s'are always on the lookout for television programming featuring latino character and familiar cultural theme actual sighting are rare and once a show air and get cancelled there is often a significant lag time before network are game enough to take another bite out of the tamale that 's how they do in hollywood right you could have white male strike out with crappy program and they 're right back in the director 's chair before lunch you wo n't hear top studio executive talking about taking a decade long sabbatical from doing other project by white male but that 's the game they run on latino in aka pablo'produced by norman lear and starring a young comic named paul rodriguez'premiered on abc it wa canceled after six episode after week of taking fire from latino activist for reinforcing stereotype in george lopez'produced by sandra bullock and starring comedian george lopez'had it debut on abc in and ran for five season before being cancelled in it 's now in syndication in abc put forth it third latino comedy with cristela created by and featuring comic cristela alonso who became the first latina to create produce write and star in a primetime comedy the show wa cancelled after one season and finally this fall nbc launched telenovela'starring eva longoria who is also an executive producer on the television comedy the network originally ordered episode but later cut back it request to just episode with that track record you would think that the arrival of bordertown'which fox billed a taking 'a satirical look at the cultural shift occurring throughout america 'in the primetime line up of a major network would be warmly received by latino but if you believe that your knowledge of my peep is a taco short of a combination plate we 're o p 'original pessimist give u a silver lining and we 'll find a cloud sure enough within minute of the closing credit there were grumbling and barb floating about on social media'including many from latino critic said the show wa low brow crass embarrassing and juvenile some proclaimed it simply terrible a silly show that promotes ugly cultural stereotype and give white people license to laugh at u and those were some of the nicer comment clearly like other offering from seth macfarlane this show wo n't be everyone 's cup of tequila i figured that out when becky turned to j c and said 'i want you to put a baby in me so i can fight for the right to legally abort it or when bryce a janitor at the border patrol station wa abducted by alien in a spaceship looking for a 'cheap anal probe while the show is on maybe you should leave your year old abuela in the other room no not you mr clinton but c'mon folk not everything on television ha to be downton abbey there must certainly be room on the creative spectrum for a show like bordertown which tackle sensitive subject like immigration assimilation language culture and race relation with a mix of humor and irreverence having come to grip with the fact that the immigrant neighbor he look down on is actually more successful than he is bud speaks for million of american struggling with a rapidly changing world when he turn to his wife and say 'i just do n't know where a guy like me fit in anymore ' and you ca n't help but chuckle when ernesto asks a mexican american border patrol agent who insists he doe n't speak spanish 'how are your parent francisco and consuela and indignantly he responds 'frank and connie are fine another thing that help shape how latino are reacting to bordertown is the fact that the project involves several latino writer and producer they include journalist gustavo arellano who serf a a consultant and cartoonist lalo alcaraz who serf a consulting producer here 's something you might have noticed latino do n't often pat each other on the back'unless they 're looking for a soft spot to stick the knife need i make here the obvious reference to ted cruz and marco rubio ethnic loyalty is overrated for those who would like to break that pattern and be supportive of a couple of latino who done good bordertown give them the opportunity those who do n't have anything nice to say could take their mother 's advice and say nothing so latino who did n't like the show have a problem should they be supportive by holding their tongue or say their piece even if it make them seem like just another crab in a bucket finally there 's the soul searching that always accompanies the arrival of show like this should latino be grateful to fox for being brave enough to wade into these water or trash the offering and demand better programming if activist choose the latter they could wind up with nothing there are no entitlement in this game hollywood doe n't owe u a thing and no one said that being able to see our experience reflected on television wa our birthright in spite of everything some latino will still be critical of bordertown but i have to ask what are they afraid of doe anyone really fear that the rest of america will watch a show like this and come away thinking that this animated series is really a documentary that all latino are really like this if that 's true then we have much bigger problem than what 's on television,5800.0

for non consensual sexual intercourse with another male student 'one of the key phrase wa 'we found you guilty plan on not booking a flight back ' that still punch me in the stomach matthew told the daily beast 'the following day i had an am flight i wa up 'till am i had to pack up all of my room his love and trust in his college completely changed when he wa notified that school wa 'investigating two alleged incident of nonconsensual sexual intercourse according to the letter matthew received from the office of title ix coordination which he shared with the daily beast title ix is a statute that prohibits sex based discrimination in school that receive federal funding and it is often applied to enforce sexual assault reform matthew adamantly denied both charge stating their first encounter wa consensual and the second wa not actually sexual he said at that second encounter the accuser 'led me into a room and started kissing me i said 'i 'm not comfortable ' and he said he needed to go matthew thought nothing of their most recent encounter until he wa notified a few day later that he had been accused of two count of sexual assault the next couple of month were a devastating time of being 'branded a rapist he said on his small campus and breaking into panic attack every time he crossed path with his accuser 'during this process i learned what it meant to be scared he said in addition to grappling with what in his mind wa a false accusation matthew lived in fear of further retaliatory charge he became frightened to be alone on campus terrified of crossing path with his accuser 'i had class and tried to do homework and pretend it wa all okay but i wa considered a threat this is a small residential college so how do you navigate the space where you do n't want to see this person and you can be accused of retaliating 'what do you do if you go to class and you see this student you have to turn away because even if you brush against them you can be accused of retaliating matthew wa disappointed with the investigatory process at his school and felt he had been 'unfairly treated during our interview he cited what he saw a many failing in the process including the fact that the majority of the witness he submitted to the title ix office were never called 'i do want to recognize sexual assault is real and horrible i 'm happy to know there are procedure and thing put in place to bring justice to those who are sexually assaulted their story should be told 'but in case like mine those who abuse the system and use it to hurt other student whatever ulterior motive with sexual assault'it is a horrible thing to happen magnifying the pain and stress of his situation are the fact that this suspension forced him to come out to his parent 'can you imagine coming out to your family under the pretense you 're accused of sexual assault and you 're found guilty during the investigation i knew my family would be there to support me but i could not imagine coming out to them twice first a an alleged rapist and second a someone who is gay 'i 'm struggling with depression he said 'i 'm struggling with insomnia i 'm struggling to figure out the rest of my life i 'm trying to pick up the piece in january president obama launched a special task force to investigate rape and sexual assault on campus on may the department of education revealed school were under investigation for title ix violation related to their mishandling of sexual assault case that list ha since grown to well over during the past two year the federal government ha stressed how severe a problem sexual assault is on college campus often citing that one in five female student are sexually assaulted with the bureau of justice statistic releasing another study supporting that estimate this past month this most recent study defined sexual assault a 'forced kissing touching grabbing or fondling according to inside higher ed that broad definition ha raised concern about the accuracy of the one in five and the even more alarming one in four statistic published in and whether these statistic misleading perpetuate a sense of panic on campus attorney andrew miltenberg estimated that two around two year ago he had only had five or six case involving male student suing their school for being wrongfully expelled or suspended for sexual assault or violence 'there wa not a daily flow of call on this topic and now there are in the last to month the complaint and how to represent and process these disciplinary matter have become an issue miltenberg told the daily beast saying he ha been approached by young men from over different university over that time seeking his legal counsel with the federal government 's effort in the past two year bringing more attention to campus sexual assault the medium ha more often reported the perspective and experience of victim of sexual assault understandably so because they had been ignored stigmatized and in some case actively silenced for so long le frequently reported are the turmoil and hardship for the student accused of sexual assault a well a the emotional and financial anguish suffered by their family during an investigative process that many'including the harvard law faculty argue violate their due process right miltenberg believed the disciplinary process itself contributes to the emotional turmoil for the student accused of sexual assault 'it almost feel like the process is part of the punishment said miltenberg 'they his client are suicidal they are depressed they are anxious there is an overwhelming sense of despair because the weight of the institution and the weight of the process are bearing down on them they are dropping out they are in therapy 'the counterpoint is think of the trauma to the victim and of course i do i have two daughter and a son miltenberg said to him the sexual assault disciplinary process on campus is a disservice to both the victim and the accused 'there 's something about the way the process is evolving that doe n't work for the accuser and the accused for this article i interviewed people i found through family advocating for campus equality a group established to provide legal guidance for student who believe they were falsely accused of sexual assault the student and their parent all described their encounter a completely consensual even in one case not in fact sexual in nature it go without saying that this cohort ha it own bias and in some case anger nevertheless these student ' and their family ' story paint a rarely told account of the emotional and financial hardship of going through the campus sexual assault disciplinary process a someone accused of one of the most heinous crime possible 'it 's a heavy burden to bear the stench never leaf the stigma attache no matter how it resolve said miltenberg while matthew is grappling with whether to return to a school that he belief punished him for a false accusation his option is enviable to someone like alex a year old who asked to have his last name withheld alex wa expelled from his college in fall of for sexual assault six week before he wa set to graduate alex said official from his school have refused to answer his or his father 's request for how the disciplinary panel decided to expel him or reject his appeal instead on the day the decision wa reached he said an administrator simply told him 'you have to pack up all your stuff and be moved off campus by o'clock today alex who had been on the school 's football team described being in a state of shock while trying to quickly pack up his belonging and empty out his locker room before his teammate arrived to avoid the embarrassment of explaining he had been expelled'or why he had been expelled 'we were all getting ready to go on a bus to go on an away game i wa supposed to go on a bus with them and i wa getting kicked out i tried to get to the locker room to clean out my locker but a few were there early that wa really embarrassing i said goodbye to them i wished them luck his parent drove close to three hour to pick him up and bring him home after filing his appeal and having it 'rubber stamped with a rejection a alex called it by the title ix coordinator his shock turned into depression 'i wa just in a rut i moped around my house i did n't work i gained weight i did n't want to go back to the gym and show my face because everyone thought i wa supposed to be at school i did n't want to answer question about why i wa there and not at school i thought about the situation and cried myself to sleep i wa borderline suicidal alex said he decided to start going to therapy this past april around six month after he wa expelled because 'i just knew i wa n't mentally healthy he said 'the thought i wa having about driving my car off the road into a tree were scaring me i did n't want to hurt anyone who loved me i knew i needed help while alex said he take antidepressant everyday now mg of celexa and regularly see a therapist he ha by no mean recovered financially or emotionally 'it 's ruined my life it 's too late to go back to school and pick a different career i 'm embarrassed it 's put a hold on my life i still have no degree nothing to show for it i feel like everything ha just stopped and i ca n't go anywhere he said charlotte whose son wa expelled from a small liberal art college in the midwest said her son struggled with suicidal thought from the moment the campus disciplinary process began she remembered getting the call that he had been accused of sexual assault'and had been rushed to a psych ward 'i wa at the grocery store with my husband i get a call from my son and he say 'mom they 're taking me to the hospital carly editor 's note not the real name of the female student is accusing me of rape and i freaked out and i said what 's the point of living they 're taking me to the psych ward and i 'm scared ' she told the daily beast 'he said he had a plan for how he wa going to carry out suicide charlotte said her son wa initially suspended a year but when his accuser wrote a letter appealing and begging for a harsher punishment he wa expelled charlotte said 'i still have fear that the suicide thing might come back charlotte said 'he 's assured me that he 's fine but he 's not moving on he 'll do chore around the house if i ask him it ha to be very specific direct request he doe n't have a lot of internal motivation i feel this whole thing ha killed the son i had this is not my son he wa so driven so motivated he had this whole plan and now it 's like he 's dead parent interviewed for this article echoed this description of the dramatic mental health toll of their son ' experience of being falsely accused of sexual assault on college campuses'even when they were ultimately found not guilty of the charge abby said her son wa charged with sexual assault a a freshman at southern methodist university smu even after a grand jury declined to indict him for the alleged incident her son wa found not guilty by the school by his sophomore year according to abby however even though a

process 'as terrifying a going through the legal process'the potential wa year in the federal pen which is a terrifying thought'knowing he did n't do something wrong we thought the truth would prevail abby told the daily beast 'and it did he got through that pretty well he had his right and his right were upheld but the mental health problem he now suffers are a result of the protracted school disciplinary process and 'mind game on the part of administrator she said smu is not one of the university currently under federal investigation for violating title ix in it handling of sexual assault 'when we started down the path for the school disciplinary process it blew out of control you 're hearing no harm no foul but it 's not fine he 's not the same person he wa he will not be the same person he wa abby said she recalled how the formerly optimistic cheerful boy her son wa vanished after the school investigation 'he wa probably in middle school and i said 'the glass is always half full for you ' and he said 'oh no for me the glass is always filled to the brim ' that 's how he looked at life abby said it 's a stark contrast to the life she said her son currently lead fearful of leaving his apartment and suffering from ptsd depression and anxiety abby said multiple psychiatrist diagnosed these mental health disorder a direct result of the trauma caused by his former university 's disciplinary process he ha been unable to complete a semester at his new college when asked to comment on the allegation that the school 's sexual assault investigatory process directly resulted in an accused student 's development of depression anxiety and ptsd smu 's office of public affair told the daily beast in an emailed statement 'smu take each report of sexual assault seriously and follows it procedure in accordance with the federal law title ix of the education amendment of state law and university policy the university recognizes that these case are complex and

a restaurant it 's too stressful those ptsd victim seek a safe place when they carve out that safe place they do n't leave it he doe n't go out to the grocery store he order in she said 'he called me the other day sobbing 'i 'm so tired of this i just want this to go away ' that 's the norm now she said the fact that her son wa exonerated is of cold comfort 'you see your kid destroyed through no fault of his own the destruction this ha caused is just unbelievable in part too it 's frustrating because everyone say 'oh great everything worked out ' well actually no he may a well have been expelled because he ha n't been able to finish a college semester since miltenberg made the same point stressing that regardless of whether the judicial outcome for his client were positive and negative they did not fully recover from the process 'i 've talked to over young men not one of them is okay after this experience miltenberg said 'whether we have settled or gotten the student

financial stress his sexual assault expulsion ha placed on his family even with the help of his parent he is currently struggling to pay student loan on a degree that never materialized and legal bill for hiring an outside attorney to advise him on battling a crime he said he did n't commit 'i still live with my family i 'll only move out in my wildest dream ' i 'm just wasting my time wasting my life and staying at my parent ' house i ca n't grow up and be an adult and start my life that 's the most depressing and frustrating thing every person interviewed said their family had spent at least ten of thousand of dollar for legal and or mental health counseling in response to the sexual assault allegation one mother said she and her husband had already incurred six figure worth of debt alex said his family ha already accrued at least in debt but he 's determined to have justice'so much so that he worked three job this past summer 'i did construction monday through friday i coached crossfit with private client at the gym i did security at casino over the weekend all the money ha gone to student loan and the lawyer my parent had to dip into their retirement to help pay for it i feel guilty i feel terrible it 's just really depressing alex ha filed a federal complaint against his school and he said the school ha filed a motion to dismiss he is waiting and hoping he will get his day in court to fully clear his name 'i 'm embarrassed i 'm ashamed a lot of people i went to school with are very supportive and said 'no one belief i did it ' but you ca n't help but wonder what

nearby burn livestreamer and self appointed bundy spokesman pete santilli wa arrested john ritzheimer who wa occupying the refuge and had become one of it most prominent spokesman turned himself in on the same charge while on a visit home to arizona it appears the bundy clan knew arrest or worse wa becoming more inevitable when ammon 's deputy started going home to say goodbye to their family ritzheimer wa in arizona and said he wa planning to see his wife and child before heading back north at least two refuge occupant have traveled to utah and back already back in oregon the arrest have only escalated tension brandon curtis president of the idaho three percenter militia that ha patrolled burn and provided security for the occupier at the refuge said no one 's leaving 'we 're still going to maintain our same position the community ha asked u to stay and we 're trying to be there the best we can for support and to continue our investigation curtis told the daily beast on wednesday morning in fact a clarion call ha gone out from oregon to militia group and they 're heeding it local told the daily beast they saw truckloads of new face coming in overnight 'i did n't pick this day mom say one of the occupier on a call home that wa livestreamed online 'i believe god ha this plan i love you if you 've ever wanted to know what love of country taken to an extreme sound like turn on one of the livestreams and hear people talk about what they think they 're sacrificing and why the plan is le providential than it is tactical plenty of supply food and ammo have been brought to the refuge since the takeover on jan unless the fed come onto the compound to evict the occupant this could feasibly go on for a few month they knew it wa coming eventually of course people laugh at the militia dude but plenty are ex military and know exactly how to handle tactic in this situation where you might lose command at any time and they 've had week to talk it over in case of ammon 's arrest whomever he 'd left in charge would be in charge since ammon wa arrested with four top deputy everyone is simply going to carry out the plan that wa made for this eventuality 'it 's going to be impossible to control say curtis the new likely leader on the refuge blaine cooper is a soft spoken man who often disavows what he considers fringe theories'though he think the government kill with impunity and he 's just been given evidence that the fbi is willing to kill him and everyone with him cooper ha been with the bundys at least since cliven 's standoff in nevada in he 's a member of an arizona militia and ha called for the impeachment of john mccain david fry who is usually found working on website and video editing is spending his morning at the refuge wrapped in a blanket clutching a rifle with brightly colored confederate flag on it fry stave off the boredom of watch trying to identify shell casing he is n't a weapon guy but someone 's given him one anyway 'you usually get to choose what kind of weapon you get in video game he say today on the refuge militant are constructing firebreak and digging ditch around their perimeter they speak about lavoy 's family and their own everyone understands that the stake have just become a bit heavier it 's not a question of when anymore it 's a question of how finicum is missing from his usual place on the refuge and everyone notice finicum wa a leader and spokesperson for the bundys and those associated with them he wa everywhere in the refuge bringing food or being what he considered to be generally helpful when i left the refuge he shook my hand and thanked me for coming down personally to the place to report instead of just watching cnn 'i do n't care what kind of story you write he told me 'just so long a it 's fair the shooting death of finicum sent a wave of myriad reaction through local some have taken to gleeful reaction some are sad it came to this kristie potter davis a rancher who life near malheur and had therefore been acquainted with finicum asked someone to tone it down on facebook because she 'd just lost a friend 'i 've just lost an enemy so shut up came the quick rejoinder nobody in the refuge would have believed that finicum would fire the first shot but nobody that 's ever spoken to him could doubt that he wa determined not to be arrested ammon bundy told his wife on the phone people wrote on facebook that finicum wa lying prone with his hand extended when he wa killed other report have him charging at police it 's impossible to know what really happened in the end the arrest and killing changed nothing the fbi created a martyr for militiaman nationwide and turned ammon and ryan bundy into hero for the sort of people who are so alienated and angry they think that armed resistance is the only remaining option those people will if given enough time make their way to malheur it could have been called an occupation before strictly speaking now there 's no doubt it 's a standoff the only thing in question is whether more people will die,26250.0

russia at the same time they say the direct interdependence between russia and hezbollah is increasing the united state and the european union have both listed hezbollah a a terrorist organization with global reach and accuse it of serving tehran 's interest but there is more to it than that organized trained funded and armed by iran with syrian help after the israeli invasion of lebanon in it initially gained fame for suicide bombing hitting israeli french and american target there including the u s marine barrack in beirut where american serviceman were killed in over the year hezbollah

linklater dream is destiny it 's a monument to the modest austinite 's vast and varied oeuvre from dazed and confused to the before sunset trilogy to his year magnum opus boyhood 'i think rick is one of the truly great filmmaker and i think a much praise a he get due to the diversity of his body of work he get overlooked say black the longtime editor of the austin chronicle 'there are four or five book on rick and sixty book on quentin tarantino i 'm not knocking wes anderson or quentin but the one who do the same thing over and over again are the one who get the most press there 's also a special event that 's summoned linklater to sundance a special screening of dazed and confused with commentary courtesy of linklater and jason reitman 'it doe n't seem to go away doe it say a smiling linklater of dazed when i ask him what his favorite line in the film is he pause 'man i can give the origin story to every line in it i had this friend up in montana who you could ask anything and he 'd answer 'it 'd be a lot cooler if you did ' that wa from the ' s so i knew i 'd use that in a movie someday and then the line 'i get older they stay the same age ' that wa said by another friend of mine like any writer you remember thing and file them away despite it cult classic status dazed wa no walk in the park 'it wa a really difficult movie to get made because gramercy picture really did n't want to make it i think they got forced into it they had their doubt and if you talk to some of those people today they still think it doe n't quite work i 've heard it or that it 's an 'underachievement ' it wa tough on top of the lack of confidence actor jason london randall 'pink floyd and shawn andrew kevin pickford were at odds during filming even once coming to blow andrew proved to be quite the troublemaker after filming wrapped he ran away with milla jovovich to vega and the two got married she wa just year old 'oh shawn recall linklater 'that wa after production it got annulled it wa brief sixteen year old milla and year old shawn but the mother stepped in i heard dazed went on to gross just million against a million budget but it became wildly popular on vhs

sequel everybody want some will premiere at sxsw in march before opening wide in april 'it 's four year later and the true sequel to dazed say linklater 'i wa like 'why is this so much le stressful oh it 's college ' everything is chill everyone 's got their own space in high school you 're thrown into a cage match of territory and you do n't really have a place of your own in high school you 're stuck together but in college it 's your freedom your choice so to me dazed wa about trying to create something within a lack of freedom while college is what to do once you 've stepped into all that freedom one of the central character in dazed and confused is mitch kramer wiley wiggins a freshman baseball pitcher who when he 's not gripping his nose in frustration is dodging getting his as

baseball in dazed say linklater 'it 's about it but it 's not the season it 's a first weekend of college movie but it 's a if mitch four year later went off to college and he 's still a baseball pitcher it 's a different character but it 's the same thing the timing of a dazed sequel is curious given that it come right after linklater completed boyhood which took him a dozen year or not 'i 've been trying to make this one for about ten year he say 'i had that idea in ' ' i just wanted to make this college movie about what it wa like to be the newness it wa n't really a reaction to anything just a movie i 've wanted to make for quite some time 'it 's always been that story but boyhood ended up touching it where boyhood end where everybody want some begin he add 'there 's a little overlap with boyhood in that it 's a completely different guy but the same kind of environment on the subject of boyhood the oscar nominated filmmaker insists 'there are no secret project brewing on the side with pal frequent star ethan hawke'this includes another before film 'i do n't know we 're only in year three say linklater 'we always have a five year hiatus where we do n't even

data from glaad show that many american believe obergefell v hodges wa the finish line for lgbt equality half of all non lgbt american believe that gay people currently have the same right a everyone else according to a harris poll survey of over adult commissioned by glaad for it second annual accelerating acceptance report the finding only get more disheartening from there nearly percent of non lgbt respondent said they feel uncomfortable when they see a same sex couple holding hand or learn that their child 's teacher is lgbt a quarter of them believe that high rate of depression and suicide among lgbt people are 'not serious and percent said the same about violence against transgender people these number are an improvement from last year but not by much many fell by only a few percentage point and some'like discomfort with lgbt history lesson being taught in school or at seeing an lgbt co worker 's wedding photo'were virtually unchanged in it may be legal for a lesbian to get married but she will still likely pause before planting a picture of her spouse on her desk over a third of non lgbt respondent to the harris poll survey ' percent'said that social acceptance of lgbt people wa n't a serious problem even though many of their own survey response ironically prove that it still is 'complacency is the enemy of social progress said glaad ceo president sarah kate elli in a statement accompanying the report ' wa a monumental year for the lgbt community but marriage equality is a benchmark'not a finish line the hard work of legislative change must go hand in hand with that which can not be decided in a courtroom changing heart and mind the fact about the current state of lgbt acceptance are easy enough to consult over half of all state have no statewide employment non discrimination law covering sexual orientation or gender identity lesbian gay and bisexual youth are four time more likely to attempt suicide than straight kid and a quarter of transgender youth have made an attempt twenty one transgender people primarily young transgender woman of color were murdered in the u s last year'the highest recorded number in history those number do n't lie and there are plenty of other sobering statistic where they came from but the bitter truth is that we saw this apathy coming when same sex marriage wa legalized by the supreme court last june leader of major lgbt organization in the u s told the daily beast that their fight wa far from over citing a wide range of remaining issue including employment discrimination anti transgender violence school bullying detention of lgbt immigrant bisexual acceptance and lgbt youth homelessness 'i have been doing this work long enough that i can predict the future lambda legal executive director kevin cathcart said at the time 'the victory will be sweet and some people will declare the movement over'but they will be wrong what 's concerning now is just how many people think it 's over and just how wrong they are somewhere between and percent of homeless youth are lgbt but percent of non lgbt respondent to the harris poll survey said the problem wa n't 'serious that includes percent who said it wa 'not at all serious almost a quarter said they do n't think hiv in the lgbt community is a serious issue and yet the rate of new infection ha 'remained relatively stable over the last decade per cdc data disproportionately affecting gay and bisexual black and latino men our lgbt neighbor to the north also warned the daily beast last july that marriage could lull the u s into a false sense of security canada 's largest and oldest lgbt national lgbt organization egale nearly folded in the year after same sex marriage wa legalized nationwide in said executive director helen kennedy egale ha since thrived but kennedy noted that she run up against 'a certain amount of apathy and exhaustion in her current work 'these are issue that are pressing they 're very concerning and they need attention she said of egale 's current work 'but everyone say 'you have marriage ' 'the coming gay right letdown a the daily beast labeled it at the time is here in same sex marriage wa a critical social issue at the heart of the u s presidential election in lgbt issue have largely been absent from even the democratic primary debate marriage wa definitely not the most important issue facing lgbt american but it wa certainly the most discussed the current silence is telling 'glaad 's finding point to a culture of complacency wherein the non lgbt public is under the false and potentially dangerous impression that the work for lgbt equality is done the report note even non lgbt people who described feeling 'very or somewhat comfortable in various situation involving lgbt people'having an lgbt family member going to church with lgbt people etc 'had some striking apathy issue thirty seven percent of this subset neither agreed nor disagreed with the following statement 'it is best for a child to be raised by a mother and a father a opposed to two father or two mother once again this misperception only take a few click to debunk columbia law school 's 'what we know project found that of scholarly study on this subject concluded that child of gay and lesbian parent 'fare no worse than other child glaad belief that the furor around the legalization of same sex marriage may have even stalled public knowledge of lgbt issue at least temporarily their report on the harris poll data speculates that people may believe gay people have more right than they do ' p erhaps because marriage equality wa so widely covered by the medium in if the medium treat marriage a a synonym for civil right then why would n't public perception follow suit in a related finding respondent who were more uncomfortable with lgbt people were much more likely to say that they 'receive more attention today than other minority community suggesting that some bristle at the continuing coverage of these issue post obergefell but however much medium attention lgbt people receive it 's apparently not enough to convince american that their problem are real fifty one percent of this 'uncomfortable subset said that lgbt social acceptance wa not a serious problem surprise surprise there is still hope however distant at the end of the rainbow younger american are much more likely to be accepting of lgbt people glaad 's report divided non lgbt respondent into 'allies 'detached supporter and 'resisters based on their self described comfort level with lgbt people younger generation were disproportionately more likely to be 'allies with those aged to comprising percent of all 'resisters in the sample despite making up percent of the population at large adult between the age of and on the other hand were disproportionately more likely to be categorized a 'resisters in fact adult between and constituted a quarter of all 'resisters even though they are only percent of the total population given these trend the eventual acceptance of lgbt people seems inevitable how slowly we get there is a different story at the current rate a future when a

caucus and he knew anything he said about politics might result in unwanted 'calls even though i promised anonymity he wa worried he spoke in a whisper we were discussing donald trump despite his affair divorce ignorance about biblical basic and admission that he 'd never asked god for forgiveness trump ha attracted some high profile evangelical supporter both in iowa and around the country recently he wa endorsed by jerry falwell jr the evangelical president of liberty university 'i think he 's just pragmatic the pastor said of falwell 'but i do n't think he 's being honest hardly any well known evangelicals agree with him and a for those who do agree 'even if someone say they 're evangelical they may be very very immature biblically there are some evangelicals that are not thinking straight they are not thinking straight or some are really'they do n't even read their bible and they 're easily led away like jesus said we 're like sheep in the last two caucus here evangelical voter have determined the winner in they supported huckabee a former pastor from arkansas in they favored rick santorum a catholic who campaigned heavily for their affection both men went on to third place loss in new hampshire and neither of course secured the republican nomination the power of evangelical voter in iowa make it tough to predict who will win until the actual voting take place one candidate may be leading the poll but if evangelicals turn out for a different candidate it 's all over santorum did n't begin to surge in until the week before the caucus he 's running again this time but nobody'evangelical or otherwise'seems to care trump ha led the poll here for month though he wa briefly dethroned by ben carson an active christian and then by ted cruz who could

matter of christian stewardship this is the election that really matter this is the time for revival the flyer were distributed by the family leader a social conservative advocacy group based in pleasant hill and run by bob vander plaats who worked for huckabee in a his iowa state chair and endorsed santorum in this cycle vander plaats is for ted cruz 'iowans are in the unique position to voice first what kind of president we should elect how would god have you use that gift and responsibility the flyer read 'in the bible when israel had gone astray and god brought revival he used both the 'church ' and the 'state ' josiah is the prime example of a kind whose call to repentance brought his nation back to the heart of god 'presidents have historically pulled america closer to god ' or turned u from him the flyer continued 'it 's time for the voice of the church to help elect a president who will lead in godly way now is when we choose our josiah it is time all eleven republican candidate are christian but the pastor said just two could accurately be described a evangelical ted cruz and mike huckabee of cruz he said 'i think he 's brilliant cruz 's faith ha been central to his campaign he announced his candidacy at liberty university in virginia despite having no connection to the place he went to princeton and harvard and here in september he launched an initiative called ' iowa pastor a plan to get the support of a pastor in each of iowa 's county in self mythologizing cruz ha claimed that while at summer camp at a christian ranch a a child he 'surrendered to

contemporary service would be held later on in a gymnasium a few musician got onstage to sing christian rock everyone around me knew the word to 'this is my father 's world after the a m service at walnut creek i made my way down the hall to the gymnasium where a much larger crowd had formed hardly any people in attendance were open to talking politics but one man wore a cruz t shirt and just a few row away sat huckabee and his wife janet underneath a basketball hoop he fiddled with his finger and looked up at the large projection screen on the stage which featured the lyric to the song the band played 'o how sweet to trust in jesus just to trust his cleansing blood just in simple faith to plunge me 'neath the healing cleansing flood huckabee told me he wa feeling 'excellent about his chance in the caucus but if the behavior of his campaign and affiliated entity is any indication he 's frustrated that evangelicals are going for cruz on tv here an ad by pursuing america 's greatness a super pac supporting huckabee seems to play every few minute it 's an attack on cruz for not tithing or giving percent of his income to the church in the evangelical tradition 'he doe n't tithe one actress say to another 'a millionaire that brag about his faith all the time just what we need another phony huckabee ha not gone after trump who he appeared side by side with at a rally on thursday in de moines in a similar fashion the pastor said the criticism wa ridiculous 'tithing mean nothing he said 'he 's trying to somehow peel people away from cruz and it 's like silly'it 's supposed to

kurtz selected jerry ambrose to be the city 's chief financial officer both men were tasked by the republican governor 's administration with restructuring the city 's government to save money after it wa in danger of becoming insolvent one cost saving measure considered wa to quit buying municipal water from detroit in a civil deposition not reported until now ambrose testified under oath that emergency manager kurtz considered a proposal to use the flint river discussed the option with the michigan department of environmental quality and then rejected it in ambrose wa deposed in a civil lawsuit brought by retired flint municipal worker against the state over severe cut to their health care benefit attorney alec gibbs questioned ambrose about the water decision a year before flint learned it wa being poisoned 'there wa brief evaluation of whether the city would be better off to simply use the flint river a it primary source of water over the long term ambrose said 'that wa determined not to be feasible 'who determined it wa n't feasible gibbs asked 'it wa a collective decision of the emergency management team based on conversation with the mdeq that indicated they would not be supportive of the use of the flint river on a long term basis a a primary source of water ambrose answered 'what wa the reason they gave gibbs asked 'you 'll have to ask them ambrose said how could the river that wa rejected a flint 's permanent water source in december suddenly become suitable for consumption a mere month later and who actually made the disastrous choice to start using the previously rejected river a the city 's temporary water source howard croft the former director of public work for flint who resigned in november asserted more than four month ago in a videotaped interview with the aclu of michigan that the decision to use the dangerously corrosive river came directly from the snyder administration in the interview croft said that the decision to use the river wa a financial one with a review that 'went up through the state 'all the way to the governor 's office the aclu of michigan asked him 'all the way to the governor 's office croft replied when questioned about croft 's accusation in october sara wurfel snyder 's spokeswoman at the time offered up the false claim that the governor could not have made the decision to use the river because the city had been kicked off of detroit 's system 'the detroit water and sewer department at the time back last spring said 'hey we 're gon na cut you off ' this is a lie in a letter obtained by the aclu of michigan pdf emergency manager darnell earley wrote to dwsd in march 'thank you for the correspondence that provides flint the option of continuing to purchase water from the city of detroit ' the city of flint ha actively pursued the flint river a a temporary water source ' there will be no need for flint to continue purchasing water to serve it resident and business after april snyder did not mention this letter in the history of the flint water crisis that he presented in his state of the state address last week 'first the crisis began in spring when the flint city council voted to buy water from karegondi water authority to be supplied by lake huron former flint mayor walling supported the move and the emergency manager approved the plan dwsd provided notice of termination to be effective one year later and on april flint began using water from the flint river a it interim source detroit did terminate a year contract but it also diligently tried to strike a new deal to keep selling flint clean safe water earley rejected all offer and then sent that 'thanks but no thanks letter to detroit saying that the decision had been made to use the flint river if the governor really want to come clean he need to start telling the whole truth not just convenient piece of it snyder tried to convince the public and the press he wa doing that when he released email from and there wa rich symbolic irony in the fact that the first missive posted from the cache is completely redacted blacked out from start to finish if there wa anything at all revelatory in the email released so far it is snyder 's attention to detail there is for example a june email he sent out after being looped in on a positive television report about michigan state police bike patrol making their debut in flint 'good work wrote the governor in a message sent to his team 'let me know how thing are going in our city hopefully we wo n't have significant summer issue a the world now know a slow building scandal involving the lead contamination of the city 's water supply first came to light the following month when a leaked u s environmental protection agency memo sounding the alarm saw the light of day what remains still in the dark is the exact role michigan 's detail oriented governor played in subjecting the people of flint to the hazard of a polluted river doubling a their municipal water supply we also need to be clear on what the governor 's office and other state official knew about the danger posed by that river before the decision to use it wa made snyder can help shed light on that by releasing all of his emails'both from both his government account and any personal email account that he might have used to conduct state business'going back to at least a early a the start of when member of his own administration considered and rejected using flint 's river given his willingness to release two year ' worth of email turning over document from another two year should be no

safety and immigration the president ha tried both approach first negotiating with the other side then after realizing that negotiation is futile in the face of almost religious gun worship and anti government paranoia and against the backdrop of pure demographic panic turning to executive power instead democrat did much the same with healthcare negotiating first and then using the power of their majority to force the game the president will likely double down on tuesday in touting the result million more american with healthcare and no alternative on offer from those vowing and repeatedly voting to take it from them obama ha presided over sweeping cultural advance particularly in the right of gay and lesbian american the turnabout on these issue ha been swift including in the growing public sympathy for transgender people ' struggle for a dignified existence new opportunity for woman in the military and in a much belated recognition that there is something deeply wrong with the way our police department function in community of color but building on those victory depends heavily on democrat maintaining the white house and the growing ferocity and tenacity of the force that launched the lunch pail revolution have shown no sign of backing down in fact far from being silenced by the bullying jackboot of liberal thought police the far right 's voice have been heard loud and clear for decade the irony of their current rage is that for the last year whether on tax cut for the rich curbing public assistance to the poor or rolling back the voting right advance of the s they 've largely gotten their way even at it most outrageous early moment the tea party movement wa treated to sober and at time breathless medium coverage to the point of being invited to co host a presidential debate beltway solicitude toward the right ha in fact become so pervasive that the mainstream press can not bring itself to describe an armed gang occupying federal property in oregon recording martyrdom video and declaring they are willing to die to force the federal government to hand over public land to whomever they designate a anything more than 'protesters this a black life matter activist are publicly denounced a 'terrorists for their act of unarmed protest against the rampant use of deadly force against men woman and year old boy indeed on matter of race and policing some year of cultural norm have been shattered when it come to the open denigration of people of color up to and including the president of the united state far from being silenced the far right ha never seemed more empowered conservative have created a climate in which republican governor can not accept federal money to cover their own poor even with a percent federal match under medicaid leaving more than million red state citizen uncovered they have driven their congressional representative to mount useless vote after useless vote to try and strip away the healthcare law for everyone even to the point of shutting down the federal government a year ago backed by a medium infrastructure far more powerful than any counterpart on the left some of the same people now occupying federal land in oregon got away with shooing off federal agent and making the bureau of land management walk away from million in overdue land grazing fee by pointing assault rifle at federal agent and in just the past year the far right staged a takeover of one of the country 's two major political party deposed the house majority leader and nearly took down the speaker before he scurried away shielded by the visiting pope lately though the working class voter who produced these result have figured out that the reward for their zeal and loyalty ha been meager in term of their own job prospect and pocketbook and they 're in full on rebellion against their party 's donor class against obama and seemingly against change itself feeding this group of american ' rage with birtherism and nativism and vow to undo every single thing obama ha done build a wall to keep out mexican migrant excise every muslim from the country and talk so tough from the white house that nation tremble in the shadow of our rhetorical greatness may be poor substitute for creating broad prosperity and a sense of cultural respect but it 's what the right 's most talented and shameless demagogue have to offer right now it 's not clear what obama in his presidency 's final year and presiding over a house so deeply divided against itself could offer that would convince these angriest american to trade in their anger for hope and it 's not clear whether trying to draw them away from the demagogue would help him reach the le furious majority who are largely ignored outside the primary season circus

house on may in his hometown of detroit at the music hall center for the performing art it wa an event surrounded by a great deal of fanfare quarterbacked by carson 's former communication manager doug watt and it all would have gone perfectly if not for armstrong williams a man who ha kept close personal tie with carson and frequently refers to himself a the candidate 's business manager according to watt williams went behind his back and recorded an announcement at carson 's home which aired on the local florida tv station wpec on may this undercut all the planning that went into the event in detroit the following day causing the press to slowly disappear 'at about o'clock in the middle of the rehearsal that evening we 're sitting in the theater and ben is sitting in front of me with armstrong next to him watt told the daily beast after a discussion at georgetown university last week 'someone run over and say 'so you just announced 'and i 'm like what are you talking about ben is sitting right here we 're announcing tomorrow in that moment when williams had done something in secrecy subverting a carefully orchestrated and expensive plan watt knew there would be trouble and try a he might for month after this watt just could n't take it anymore in hindsight he just wished he had realized the length of the issue with williams earlier on 'my antenna should have gone up on the night of the announcement he told the daily beast 'like what the fuck i had camera fall off i had reporter fall off it wa anti climactic sean hannity left how many time do you need that this kind of headstrong bullish behavior is nothing new for williams who ha demonstrated his win at all cost temperament in the past whether defending clarence thomas in court or fighting for his own reputation when faced with a bruising harassment suit williams did not respond to a request for comment for this article whenever watt and barry bennett the former campaign manager discus armstrong williams a they have become accustomed to do since exiting the campaign on a wild confusing new year 's eve it 's a if they 've seen war watt the more boisterous of the two voice a kind of gun blazing sidekick in a western film breathes deeply before letting his diatribe rip bennett who managed to get watt to stick around longer than anticipated is contemplative and jovial breaking into a high pitched chuckle a he and watt regale each other with the somewhat traumatic story like supermodel would treat unattractive picture of themselves in high school and now that they 've separated from the campaign and bennett ha accepted a role a an unpaid advisor for trump 's camp it 's a no hold barred war against williams who took to facebook on friday to address their 'unmitigated gall 'if they are so willing to throw carson under the bus what will they do to their next employer williams wrote a bennett and watt see it it 's williams who ha thrown carson under the bus now they just hope that carson will wake up listen to reason and stop taking order from the man who they say ha driven the campaign 'off a cliff 'ben carson ha never said armstrong williams is my business manager bennett said emphasizing that that specific designation is an invention from williams ' own imaginative brain 'what business is it that they have together the thing that cut the deepest for bennett and watt is that they really like carson and were personally touched by his inspiring story watt studied the playbook of barack obama 's successful presidential campaign hoping that carson could capitalize on the same groundswell of support from people looking for hope once again in the soft spoken former neurosurgeon the tag team saw a person who could be the insurgent candidate the republican party desperately needed a similar game plan that ha worked it magic for ted cruz donald trump and it worked in the brief spell where carson became the nation 's frontrunner and the only person to date who managed to outpoll trump nationally for bennett and watt it all seemed possible too but for armstrong williams who on multiple occasion bypassed the rest of the team approving fiscally irresponsible move and permitting interview for carson and his team that turned disastrous in just one of these case williams offered up a personal driver for carson before the campaign wa granted secret service protection according to bennett he would drive carson around willy nilly for month until williams dropped a invoice for his service with no warning and no precedent in another instance williams outsourced the production of a campaign song to the tune of over the problem wa that the campaign had already put money behind another tune already and williams knew that 'what the f bennett said trailing off to avoid saying the word 'i 'm not paying for this above and beyond his flagrant disinterest in collaborating with the campaign infrastructure williams would allegedly lie to carson to create an illusion that all internal relation were sound 'sometimes armstrong would lie to him and say that he had talked to u and that we had signed off bennett said 'that wa never the case then ben would try to be the peacemaker 'i think he 's just living in an alternative universe bennett said trying to understand why carson would still cooperate with williams such wa the discordant nature of a campaign where in many instance reporter would struggle with conflicting statement coming out of two disparate camp bennett and watt on one side and williams on the other in some case williams would be on the phone with carson and reporter at the same time trying to get the story straight in real time even a williams attempted to float above the campaign never distinguishing himself a an actual staffer and never actually appearing at campaign headquarters he wa always pulling the string 'yeah he would tell you he ha nothing to do it which is complete and utter bullshit bennett said williams ha never made a secret of how tough he can be to his colleague and employee even using it a a defense in a sexual harassment case that wa eventually dismissed both bennett and watt acknowledged the case itself wa just a subsidiary concern a williams positioned himself for a role in carson 's presidential campaign but wa just one of a multitude of reason why watt and bennett began to lose faith in the whole endeavor 'we only read it in passing and said 'ok i guess we 're going to have to handle this at some point in the campaign ' watt said breaking into one of his burly laugh the plaintiff in the harassment case wa stephen gregory a young man who met williams in when he wa hired a his personal trainer at a local ymca gregory went on to work alongside williams on his radio program 'the right side a show which still air to this day and eventually became his radio producer on april gregory filed his complaint detailing allegation of sexual harassment over a period of two year and requested 'emotional distress damage in an amount to be proven at trial 'i did n't sexually harass him but i did harass him williams said defending himself in a deposition at the time 'i only harassed him to do his job the list of alleged physical and emotional altercation began with williams touching gregory 's knee while he wa driving according to gregory 's statement to psychologist in court document obtained by the daily beast there are other purported instance of williams grabbing gregory 's butt and penis in the office discussion of sexual matter request for personal time between the two of them and shared bed in hotel room on business trip gregory claimed that he wa fired from his position because he repeatedly rejected these sexual advance he and his attorney mickey wheatley requested in damage which williams chalked up to an extortion letter calling the allegation baseless williams and his attorney peter axelrad painted gregory a an inept employee who wa fired for doing a bad job 'to sue people who are well known who ha a degree of money you make false allegation and you hope to live a life without ever working for earning an income williams said in a deposition during williams ' deposition the argument with wheatley devolved into a series of question about the radio host 's sexuality williams a prominent medium figure in conservative circle who gained notoriety for defending clarence thomas patently denied any suggestion that he wa homosexual and referred to it a a sin 'i ca n't speak for other heterosexual but i can only speak for myself williams said when wheatley asked if it wa impossible that he harassed gregory because he is heterosexual 'it is impossible that i could have harassed the man who worked for me it is impossible while it remained unclear what if anything exactly happened between gregory and williams this wa n't the first time that an employee had leveled these sort of allegation in the past another employee ebon robinson said that williams sexually harassed him a well but later recanted the statement gregory 's counsel also alleged at the time that they had spoken to a former masseur who made similar allegation against the radio host multiple attempt to reach wheatley and gregory were unsuccessful the gregory case came to halt on january when both party suddenly agreed to dismiss the matter with prejudice in d c superior court while the attorney were preparing for what could have been a nasty trial in april gregory and williams privately agreed to walk away from the case at the time williams claimed that no money changed hand but gregory did n't comment a to whether there were financial incentive for him to dismiss the charge i am not going to comment on that he said i am very happy with the resolution when the daily beast spoke with williams ' attorney at the time peter axelrad a civil trial litigation attorney in maryland he claimed he had no idea how the case ended 'it is entirely possible that this matter wa settled axelrad said 'i ca n't tell you but to his recollection axelrad thought the suit wa a waste of time 'we did n't believe in the case he said 'i did n't believe that the plaintiff had any merit watt and bennett said williams ha never harassed anyone on the campaign except they joked for them 'my history ha always been that innocent people do n't often write check bennett added but the only thing bennett is outright willing to accuse williams of is being a bully one who push carson around until he get his way a to which way carson is going a the campaign continues to nosedive bennett say there 's only one sensible path 'i 'm sure he 'd never do it but the most influence he 'd ever have right now is with trump bennett who think trump will get the nomination said 'he could endorse trump and help him win iowa he think this 'll never happen though and that carson will ride the campaign out until the wheel fall off that is maybe unless armstrong williams say otherwise katerina pappa contributed reporting,24940.0

mcdonald family bury the video showing the killing of their son by a police officer emanuel said last month that stephen patton chicago 's corporation counsel briefed him 'towards the end of march about what the dashcam video showed and about the proposed million settlement with mcdonald 's estate after that briefing patton 's second in command thomas platt drafted settlement language to keep the dashcam video hidden for at least several year according to email reviewed by the daily beast michael robbins an attorney for the mcdonald estate balked at the demand 'the provision a drafted that we maintain the confidentiality of the material ' principally the dash cam video ' until the criminal charge are concluded which could be in effect for year is entirely unreasonable he wrote to platt on april 'nor wa any such broad sweeping confidentiality provision discussed during our meeting 'i 'll call you platt wrote robbins on april that wa the same day that emanuel wa fighting for his political life in a runoff election after he failed to win percent of the primary vote in the february emanuel won with percent against chuy garcia emanuel ha maintained since mcdonald 's death that he ha never seen the dashcam video but the email prove the mayor knew exactly what the footage showed when city lawyer negotiated a deal that would at least delay the video 's release emanuel 's lawyer were offering million in hush money to keep the video hidden just week before the runoff election and the biggest part of the deal ' that mcdonald family attorney agreed to keep the video to themselves until criminal proceeding were concluded ' just so happened to be inked the day after emanuel wa re elected the first draft wa sent to the mcdonald estate 's attorney by platt on march the draft said that the estate would only be free to release the video after potential charge were dismissed by a prosecutor or after a criminal trial wa over emanuel and his underling at the law department would have preferred this because it meant the video would have been buried under lengthy legal proceeding that could have taken year on april mcdonald 's attorney and platt suddenly agreed to keep the dashcam video hidden the only thing that changed in the settlement agreement wa the deletion of a line that said the estate agreed with the city releasing video would harm ongoing criminal investigation one week later the city council voted unanimously to approve the million settlement in just second emanuel banged a gavel to mark the approval and the end ' or so he thought ' of the greatest threat to his mayoralty emanuel wrote in a december op ed in the chicago tribune that the settlement could n't be part of a cover up because it wa the mcdonald family 's attorney who approached the city wanting to settle what wa not mentioned by emanuel is that those same attorney first rejected then somehow agreed to the city 's desire to bury the video until criminal proceeding had been completed 'longstanding practice ha been to release such material only after prosecutor and city investigator have finished their investigation emanuel wrote 'the reason for that wa to prevent potential witness from tailoring their story to fit the evidence when asked about the discrepancy between emanuel 's claim and the settlement 's final language the mayor 's deputy communication director adam collins told the daily beast 'we 've been saying publicly for month that the city always intended that the video would be released a soon a the investigation is complete he said we have been clear all along that our intention wa to release the video a soon a the investigation wa complete bill mccaffrey a spokesman for the city 's law department also said 'since april of last year the administration ha said publicly that the city always intended to release the video a soon a the investigation wa complete but the settlement agreement never required the mcdonald family 's attorney to hold the video until an investigation wa completed instead over the objection of the mcdonald estate platt and the city pressed for language that would keep the video hidden far beyond the end of investigation and until a long a a criminal trial wa concluded not only do the email show the effort to cover up what really happened to laquan mcdonald went to the top of the emanuel administration they also show the mayor 's office wa pulling string at the independent police review authority ipra which a it name indicates should be independent a day after the settlement wa approved emanuel 's deputy communication director complained to his staff that an ipra spokesperson did not report to him before speaking to a new york time reporter 'i found out a bit ago that ipra 's pio talked to monica davey about the structure of ipra and how they operate without checking in with me and despite the fact i had already reached out to coordinate earlier in the day collins wrote on april the email is important because it show that emanuel 's office wa not just suppressing information about mcdonald 's death but also controlling how the agency responsible for investigating police killing speaks to the press about it own process mccaffrey the law department spokesman defended coordination between the mayor 's office and ipra coordinating with city agency on press statement is completely separate from ipra 's independent investigative work which our office is not involved in he said in a statement emanuel told chicago tonight in december interview that 'the system did not work in this situation because there wa no transparency on the part of the law department ipra or emanuel 's top communication staffer the email show but the 'system is designed to control the message and not let the message control rahm emanuel,201704.0

the amount of knowledge that we were expected to stuff into our brain wa mind boggling and it ha only grown in size since then a i sat in lecture after lecture listening to a professor drone on and on about the krebs cycle or the microscopic structure of each layer of the intestinal wall i wondered how i could possibly remember it all and a i dissected my cadaver in gross anatomy i felt suffocated by the sheer volume of nerve artery vein and every detailed part of each organ despite the stress somehow i managed to get through it my colleague and i sat and listened diligently we studied we reviewed and we learned we came with open mind to understand each system of the body and how they worked individually and with each other we discovered how those system can break down leading to every pathology imaginable but imagine how different the education would have been if i had already decided that i knew it all because i had researched it all before several recent discussion on twitter with antivaccine advocates'none of whom were doctor or nurses'made me wonder all of these folk claimed they were well researched and they held very strong opinion on vaccine genetically modified food and several other scientific subject they insisted vaccine cause autism and various other disease they do n't and no matter how much evidence i presented to the contrary their opinion were set rigidly in stone one even explicitly told me that no matter how much evidence i showed her to the contrary she would never change her mind on the supposed evil of vaccine that got me thinking what if i had shared that closed mindedness in medical school what kind of doctor would i have become if i had refused to listen to my professor because what they taught me did n't agree with my preconceived notion of how medicine worked first my infectious disease professor would lose my confidence entirely i would refuse to believe that infectious disease are caused by bacteria and virus because i once saw a youtube video claiming that we ca n't see them so they ca n't hurt u someone could try to claim that we can see bacteria under a microscope but i would counterclaim that it could be something else like a contaminant besides my mother said that cold are caused by going outside with wet hair not some silly virus in my pharmacology course i would have had a hard time believing the professor a he described the various antibiotic that have saved million of life curing a range of disease from pneumonia to urinary infection to cancer but i would n't believe him because my naturopath told me to avoid those poison because infection can be treated just a well with cranberry juice and herb while learning about pediatrics i 'd brush off the whole module on vaccine which have eradicated smallpox nearly wiped out polio and measles and have prevented million of death and even more hospitalization but i read in a facebook group that vaccine are just a eugenics project engineered the government in an attempt to depopulate the planet plus my homeopath told me they cause autism autoimmune disease asthma peanut allergy shaken baby syndrome and sids i would probably skip most of the ob gyn course despite the fact that infant mortality is far better now than ever before due to advance in prenatal and postnatal care my sister 's doula told me that natural home birth are better for the wellbeing of the child and all those nasty drug could be avoided i would have to ignore the fact that my daughter would have died during childbirth had we attempted a home birth due to a prolapsed umbilical cord i could skip oncology altogether though cancer care ha advanced dramatically over the past year due to better chemotherapy and more highly targeted surgery and radiotherapy i would have to deny that chemotherapy can cure many type of blood cancer because my acupuncturist told me that mainstream medicine is suppressing the real cure for cancer he claim cancer is actually a fungus and can be cured by alkalizing the blood with baking soda he told me oncology is just a big moneymaking scheme for doctor and hospital that have no interest in curing anything despite exhaustive ongoing research effort and thousand of scientist and doctor dedicating their entire life to finding a cure i could probably also skip my family medicine rotation because my chiropractor claim he is qualified to act a a primary physician curing everything from diabetes to ear infection and asthma with an adjustment or two sure he did n't study medicine like a real doctor sure there is no evidence that chiropractic 'medicine is effective for anything other than low back pain and sure the subluxation he keep talking about do n't actual exist so they ca n't be blocking my nerve ' energy flow which also doe n't exist but he sound confident my surgery rotation would have been much more difficult to discount i would have to admit that removing an infected gall bladder is an instant cure but i would have felt obligated to tell the surgeon that the procedure he just performed wa unnecessary because my herbalist told me that the patient could have flushed the gallstone out using herb and olive oil i could go on but the point should be fairly evident the amount of pseudoscience false belief and unwarranted fear surrounding modern medicine is staggering and a a physician i am growing increasingly disheartened by the number of people who choose to eschew it in favor of untested or unscientific practice million of hour of research have produced this system of health that ha caused life expectancy and quality of life to be higher today than ever before there have been many bump in the road and make no mistake there will be more the recent horror in france when a clinical drug trial killed one and hospitalized others are a testament to that but abandoning the best and most advanced system of medicine ever created because of a few notable hiccup would be like abandoning air

and republican trying to shift their party 's stance on that issue said wednesday it wa received loud and clear south carolina governor nikki haley gave the republican party 's official response to president obama 's final state of the union speech and her speech mostly drew attention for it 's just barely veiled criticism of donald trump 's anti immigrant rhetoric but those on the far right may have missed the most quietly consequential part of haley 's speech towards the end of the address the governor tacitly suggested the republican party would change it course on same sex marriage if it won the white house 'we would respect difference in modern family she said 'but we would also insist on respect for religious liberty a a cornerstone of our democracy on it face that sentence may sound a little milquetoast what politician would suggest her party would n't respect family but conservative operative pushing for the party to shift it stance on marriage see the comment a a big win that 's because her specific phrasing is lifted almost verbatim from one group 's proposed re wording of the republican party platform the effort is called platform reform and it 's a project of the american unity fund which is backed in part by republican hedge fund billionaire paul singer a staunch advocate of same sex marriage who played an outsize role in getting the new york legislature to legalize back in the platform reforming campaign aim to make the republican party neutral on the issue of same sex marriage currently the platform explicitly opposes it ' w e believe that marriage the union of one man and one woman must be upheld a the national standard a goal to stand for encourage and promote through law governing marriage the platform currently read the platform reform effort want that language to say this ' w e encourage and welcome a thoughtful conversation among republican about the meaning and importance of marriage and and commit our party to respect for all family and fairness and freedom for all american platform reform operative said they did n't think haley 's word choice wa a coincidence 'i think it 's fantastic because that 's the exact sort of thing that republican ideal point towards strong family and that 's why we think our platform should be reformed said jerri ann henry the platform reform campaign manager 'so i think it 's fantastic that she included that a a top priority in her response henry added that her group ha passed it material to haley 's office 'pretty much everybody who 's ever been elected with an r by their name ha heard from u she said and henry said she 's optimistic about their odds 'it 's gon na happen she said the rationale is this rnc member are tired of losing and they do n't want to lose because of a ride or die commitment to an issue that the supreme court ha decided is done haley 's office did n't respond to a request for comment on her stance about the party platform at the republican national committee 's winter meeting in charleston the campaign handed out color printout of haley 's line about respecting modern family they also lobbied member of the rnc to back the effort to change the platform 's language and people listened kirsten hughes the massachusetts republican party chairman said the group had reached out to her and she wa open to their pitch 'i know it 's going to be something that we 're talking about she said 'sure i 'm open to it matt moore the chairman of the south carolina republican party said he feel differently 'we are a conservative party that belief in the conservative definition of marriage he said 'but we are interested in growing the party 'i want the platform to remain for traditional marriage he added 'but for those who do n't we want them in the party a well that said south carolina might be one of the least hospitable state for this effort a poll that american unity fund commissioned last summer from targetpoint consulting surveying registered voter over a week in june showed that south carolina republican primary voter are even more opposed to same sex marriage than their peer in iowa that poll showed that percent of iowa republican likely voter favored same sex marriage and percent supported it more over the past year in south carolina however just percent of likely republican primary voter backed same sex marriage right and only percent became more supportive of it over the past year cindy costa the rnc committeewoman from south carolina expressed skepticism about the political promise of platform neutralization effort 'i would say let 's not do it she said 'it 's not necessary i think it would hurt our base and cyndi mosteller who formerly chaired the charleston county republican party said she share that view 'the same principle that led u to hold to traditional marriage have not diminished in our heart she said and al phillips a conservative evangelical leader who is director of mission for the greenville baptist association said changing the party 's stance on marriage would n't likely play well in the palmetto state 'it 's kind of the buckle of the bible belt especially in the upstate he said 'and i think that if you 've got people who take the bible seriously a evangelicals do by definition then it would have a huge impact on their view of issue like marriage he added that taking out support for marriage would dampen evangelical voter ' enthusiasm 'evangelical voter are going to near unanimously be strong supporter of the traditional family not the modern family he added haley seems to be betting that modern family and evangelical republican can make peace and it 's not a sure bet one way or the other disclosure the spouse of this website 's editor in chief work for auf,19952.0

failed miserably the book is useless now a a guidebook the establishment it listed are mostly gone more important the clientele it served'african american traveler searching for housing and food in the era of segregation'does n't need it anymore that however doe not mean that the green book ha no value on the contrary while it original purpose may be antiquated it new service a a field guide to the daily and ubiquitous indignity suffered under jim crow make it invaluable if there is any tragedy here it is that most people today are blissfully unaware that such a guide ever existed much le that it thrived for three decade and wa so popular that new guide were published every year it all began in when a harlem postal worker named victor h green published his first negro motorist green book the name wa later changed to the negro traveler ' green book patterning his guide on similar publication for jew green published new edition annually until his death in and his wife continued the business until the green book listed hotel motel restaurant barbershop and beauty parlor tailor road house guest house trailer park service station theater dance hall garage and tavern where african american traveler could be sure they would not be turned away because of their skin color or a some edition put it on the cover 'for vacation without aggravation or more pointedly 'carry it with you ' you may need it the title page promised 'assured protection for the negro traveler while text inside assured reader that using a green book would allow them to travel 'without embarrassment green 's earliest edition identified only place east of the mississippi where african american would find the welcome mat out but over the year he expanded his directory to include the whole country he also published a vacation guide a railroad edition an airline edition and ultimately an international edition today actual copy of green book are rare enough to be collectible but the university of south carolina ha posted the edition online for several year and now the new york public library a part of it new online public domain collection project ha posted edition of the green book from to there is also a documentary film in the work by director becky wible searles and author calvin alexander ramsey who ha also written a play and a child 's book ruth and the green book about the guide the first couple of edition simply sold ad space for merchant in the new york area but by green wa publishing an extensive state by state directory of tourist trade merchant willing to cater to black traveler the list of establishment grew a little each year and there were roughly a many establishment in the north a in the south which tell you that traveling while black wa difficult no matter which point of the compass you picked for my trip i first thought i might drive to new jersey or pennsylvania or closer to home connecticut the listing for all those place were plentiful but then i saw that there were even a lot of listing even in late edition in westchester county where i live so i began by driving minute from my house to water street in ossining the site of the depot square hotel which wa located a block or so from the railroad station the building standing at water street is old enough to have housed the depot hotel in the late ' s but is now occupied by a laundromat and apartment here a elsewhere on the journey there wa no one around to answer question i continued on to white plain green book in hand but the ravage of time had gotten there ahead of me tarks ' restaurant an eatery so good that some of it recipe have found their way into soul food cookbook ha been replaced by an auto repair shop the site of the winbrook restaurant is now a vacant lot a city parking garage and a government building now occupy the site of the waldorf restaurant and the leaf clover restaurant i got a little excited when i got to the site of the tarry rest motel which is still occupied by another motel the alexander but the clerk behind the plexiglas window had no information about a possible predecessor and the owner wa nowhere to be found the del rio hotel site is also a vacant lot ironically the del rio stood a quarter mile from gen george washington 's revolutionary war headquarters which while currently undergoing some repair is certainly still standing it struck me a i drove home that if we can devote so much attention to a building briefly occupied by washington surely we can spare a few plaque to memorialize the hotel restaurant and other establishment where black were spared for a night or just the duration of a meal or a haircut the indignity of segregation better yet why not make victor green 's inspired guidebook required reading in america 's public school what better way to teach child about the ravage of a time when merely setting foot in the wrong restaurant or trying to use a gas station bathroom could get a careless traveler jailed or worse just because his skin happened to be the wrong color that victor green had to go to the trouble he did and that thousand upon thousand of grateful traveler used his guide for decade speaks volume about the quotidian indignity that are so much a part of this country 's history in the first edition of his travel guide green wrote 'there will be a day sometime in the near future when this guide will not have to be published that is when we a a race will have equal right and privilege in the united state he did not live to see that happen but doubtless he would be happy to know that his green book wa ultimately rendered useless he might be happier still if he knew that a a history book his guide 's value only grows with time,12371.0

network where any node in the system can access any other netflix ha to take extra steps'steps that cost money and resources'to determine based on your ip address what part of the world your computer is in and block you from downloading their content if you 're in the wrong place this is still the case even after they 've 'gone global 'israelis still ca n't watch orange is the new black singaporean ca n't watch house of card and only canadian get early access to a streaming version of star war the force awakens ironically for people who were already tech savvy enough to watch netflix overseas netflix going global will actually make it harder for israeli to watch orange is the new black netflix preceded their new year 's announcement of going global by over christmas weekend quietly taking step to make vpns harder to use on their service presumably to increase the incentive for people to sign up for legitimate overseas netflix account in other word content that wa in all practical term readily available for anyone who knew how to get it will now actually be harder for some people to get enter the tangled legal debate over geoblocking geoblocking is just another one of the many perverse situation created by an analogue marketplace that ha yet to catch up to a digital world it 's similar to the concept of medium piracy the way we buy book movie music and the like used to depend on the idea of medium coming in physical forms'bundles of page magnetic tape vinyl discs'that were costly to replicate but give everyone computer that a a matter of course make perfect copy of any information they process all the time a part of the inherent nature of processing it and the system fall apart you 're reduced to asking people to pretend that the mp on their computer which their computer can make thousand of copy of in second work like a physical vinyl record'or else your whole economy for compensating artist stop working it 's a situation that simply feel intrinsically perverse and ca n't be enforced without the creepy situation of giving the corporation that sell you music control over the computer you own it lead to endless ideological battle over what 'owning information even mean in the first place and what the moral obligation to pay for your entertainment really is geoblocking take it a level beyond that back when movie and tv show came in canister of film that had to be shipped from place to place the distribution network for movie and tv were built up separately country by country the right to sell movie and tv show were likewise split up in contractual agreement region by region country by country and parceling out those 'foreign right remains a high stake endeavor for people negotiating contract even in the world of book publishing'which ha far fewer moving part than releasing a feature film'the idea of collapsing foreign distribution right into one set of 'global right would be a seismic shock to how business is done so from the business side of thing the creation of this magical global communication network where someone in australia can browse the exact same world wide web a someone in hungary is a problem'and creating artificially separated 'distribution network between the two country make perfect sense even though in reality there 's only one distribution network now the internet from the customer 's side of thing it 's worse than anti piracy provision at least anti piracy provision are about getting you to pay money for something you want to watch geoblocking is about preventing you from using the computer you own and the internet connection you pay for to access a streaming service you also pay for and watch a movie or tv show with all it embedded advertising intact just because you 're living in the wrong country at the time the earlier generation of geoblocking region locking on internationally distributed dvd sparked a similar customer revolt and an underground trade in region free dvd player and 'region dvd that wa n't so much resolved a mooted once dvd were eclipsed by streaming service it 's an interesting situation a long a traditional distribution continues to exist alongside internet distribution distributor have a legitimate incentive to control the latter'dvd region locking started because distributor did n't want the dvd of a hollywood movie to be available in europe when that movie wa still just opening up in european cinema similarly the right to distribute orange is the new black in israel are theoretically worth something if they become worthless because everyone in israel is streaming orange is the new black through a vpn anyway then the creator have theoretically lost money how much money they 've really lost is up for debate just like the debate over how much revenue artist really lose due to piracy and yet it still seems at the end of the day ridiculous to keep people in a country who have money and want to buy something from buying it just because the right middleman are n't in place american customer are n't going to stand for being told they have to pay to watch the olympics in canada because of behind the scene wheeling and dealing not when changing your ip address to a canadian one take five minute ' worth of work after all that wa the same commercial logic behind killing aereo and telling people it 's illegal to hook up a tv tuner to a computer so people can watch over the air programming online those streaming right could theoretically be sold later for a lot of money and from a creator 's perspective aereo wa taking that money out of their pocket for a customer'like me'who see this ruling a basically a requirement that i buy an extra set of equipment a pair of rabbit ear and a tv tuner to watch jeopardy on my computer at instead of just doing so online it 's infuriating netflix hope to cut the gordian knot by creating it own content and pushing it out through it own service with no middleman at all making show that are distributed on a 'global right basis from beginning to end i wish them good luck especially because just a with getting people to pay for content a opposed to pirating it getting people to watch netflix 'legitimately rather than through a vpn is mostly a matter of good will i have my doubt though especially since one of the first reaction to netflix going global wa american scrambling to get a vpn service so they can get illicit international goody like that early access streaming of the force awakens a with other digital service maybe most of them online streaming exists in a weird limbo where playing by the rule is mostly voluntary netflix is still after all banned completely in china a country with the harshest and scariest restriction on online content around and yet tech savvy chinese citizen watch netflix'and browse facebook and twitter'all the time despite the government 's best attempt at playing whack a mole with vpn service it 's not that hard either if you want to torrent show that are too annoying to stream or to read your favorite website without giving any money to their advertiser nowadays content is mostly funded by laziness plus a dollop of guilt people who find paying the relatively cheap monthly fee for a streaming service easy enough that they give in to doing thing the legitimate way despite the miniscule chance of getting in actual legal trouble china bother to keep the great firewall up because of the majority of people who do n't care enough to circumvent it netflix is hoping that they 'll get a major influx of regular user worldwide who previously lacked the interest to jump through the hoop necessary to circumvent geoblocking and that that massive influx will give them enough funding to eventually develop a fully internet based distribution model that cut out those pesky regional distributor once and for all what they probably fear is the reverse that this will just give tech savvy existing netflix user worldwide more international content to sift through using the geoblocking circumvention tool they 've been using all along pissing off the regional distributor netflix still ha to work with with little net gain to them in the end a someone who already doe watch content intended for other region regularly i 'm going to be inconvenienced by netflix 's crackdown on vpns more than anything else but i 'll take that inconvenience if it brings u closer to the day we can leave all this nonsense behind u and have truly border free medium,14365.0

islamist leaning general national congress gnc 'have been squabbling over power since june both side have relied on a loose alliance of militia for support but mostly those are tail wagging the dog these parliament lack legitimacy or real power and it is the militia which prop them up that are actually controlling the country on dec the un security council voted unanimously to accept a transition process to implement a 'government of national accord effectively inserting a third government into libya 's chaos good luck with that syria is also a mess there are difference of course but militia rule and clumsy international attempt at solution could result in a chaotic failed state much like the one in libya so we should learn from the mistake in libya a they try to deal with the ongoing crisis in syria lesson one do n't create a power vacuum in the middle of a war while the current u s administration may or may not be willing to defer the question of syrian president bashar al assad 's transition there are u s presidential candidate on both side of the aisle who make it clear they will insist on assad 's departure sooner rather than later it is certainly true that assad 's brutality through the course of the war'including indiscriminate barrel bombing of area with significant civilian presence'makes it hard if not impossible to imagine a unified syria under his rule but if the assad regime collapsed tomorrow syria would look much like libya doe today when the strongman fall in the middle of a war'one in which both side are made up of a patchwork of competing militias'the result is not a state under the rule of law but a conflict zone under the rule of the gun just a the u s did with libya 's national transitional council ntc it could boost the syrian national council snc or some other transitional body but doing so will not change the fact on the ground the snc like it libyan counterpart doe not control the militia that are currently fighting assad in post gaddafi libya the various militia that had fought together against him did not remain united under the ntc or the next government 's banner instead they competed with one another and their clash snowballed into libya 's current civil war in syria similar conflict already exist among the splintered brigade of the free syrian army the various salafist militia and others if assad were to fall in the middle of the war this conflict would intensify and spread to area such a damascus latakia and elsewhere in the long run assad will need to go if syria is to be unified again but his transition from power should not come until the country is more stabilized this stability could come by local ceasefires like the one recently reached in homs or by broader ceasefires backed or imposed by international power lesson two people lie'especially when money and weapon are on the line when the u s offered it support to the national transitional council in libya back in it member proclaimed their belief in democracy and pluralism assuring outside backer that they would uphold these value figure in the ntc may or may not have intended to stick to these promise but in designing their security force they essentially paved the way for radical and anti democratic group to receive state funding and weapon the ntc created the 'libya shield force system which would come to include islamist militia such a the february th martyr brigade libya shield and others despite claiming loyalty to the state these militia were and still are loyal only to themselves seeking to expand their power and reputation'often by nefarious mean in a handful of these group even formed an alliance with ansar al sharia libya the group suspected of carrying out the september attack on the u s diplomatic post and the cia base in benghazi and have worked closely with them ever since in early december member of different group in the fragmented syrian opposition met in a saudi held conference pledging to support a 'democratic mechanism in syria and to respect the right of all of the country 's minority unfortunately their declaration is n't worth much the conference included radical salafist group such a ahrar al sham and jaish al islam which have tried to convince western audience that they are actually moderate group and have called on washington and other government to arm and support them one of ahrar al sham 's leader wrote op ed in the washington post and the telegraph to this effect trying to whitewash the organization 's radical ideology and violent activity so far the white house ha ignored these call but there are certainly critic arguing that it should embrace these group washington supported a libyan government that contracted it security to radical militia such a these it even entrusted it own security in benghazi to one of them before the attack going forward the u s should be more cautious in interacting with these groups'directly or indirectly'no matter how polished they appear lesson three beware of radical group creating stronghold since at least the s islamist militia have taken advantage of and operated from libya 's ungoverned and under governed territory the most notorious of these area are the northeastern coastal city of derna and the adjacent green mountains'essentially libya 's tora bora since group such a ansar al sharia libya have used this region to train fighter stockpile weapon and conduct operation ansar al sharia libya not only trained it own fighter here but also appears to have trained fighter who then went abroad to become combatant in syria or conduct attack such a the june massacre in sousse tunisia the salafist militia 's foothold in libya are not unlike the territory in northwestern syria controlled by salafist rebel such a the al qaeda affiliated jabhat al nusra ahrar al sham and others these group dominate the city and countryside of idlib jisr al shughour and part of aleppo if their control of these ungoverned area continues the threat from syria could be much greater than the threat from libya'in part because syria is a larger hub and attracts more foreign fighter from across the world beyond this if salafist militia solidify their control over the territory essentially making it permanently ungoverned space group could not only train fighter and stockpile weapon they could also take advantage of northern syria 's proximity and access to turkey'making them more mobile and more international the stronger these group become'mainly through funding from saudi arabia qatar and turkey'the harder it will be to unseat them from these stronghold it ha taken a harsh and polarizing military campaign by libyan general khalifa hifter to try to remove ansar al sharia libya from benghazi after it took control of the city in october 'a campaign that ha gone on for over a year and still ha yet to succeed what kind of effort will be required to face an entrenched al qaeda and it ally in syria washington should pressure it ally saudi arabia qatar and turkey to stop supporting these salafist militia before their hold on northwestern syria is solidified lesson learned critic are frustrated by the obama administration 's syria policy attacking him for indecisiveness or lack of will to defeat assad but president barack obama seems to have learned from the mistake of libya rather than a headlong pursuit to take down assad obama seems to be mindful of the consequence of an abrupt regime collapse instead of arming every group that memorizes the right talking point about democracy and pluralism the administration ha tried though in some case unsuccessfully to limit it support and equipment to carefully vetted rebel there remain area for the administration to improve but the lack of u s leadership that critic continue to decry may just be healthy skepticism and caution barring some kind of miracle the syrian civil war will outlast the remainder of obama 's administration one would hope that the next administration will be a cautious and remember the lesson of libya,7374.0

season it wa overcast and there wa a tornado watch utterly terrified by the idea that my blankey and bunny could be swept away by a twister i cried until my parent allowed me to take them with me into the park we ultimately compromised on storing them safely in the rental car trunk kid do n't really posse rationality a handful of decade later i 'm back and i 'm a big boy now so that can mean only one thing i 'm going to drink my way through each country of epcot 's world showcase of course for the uninitiated the showcase is a world 's fair like collection of pavilion circling a man made lagoon each one themed after a different country and staffed entirely by their own national the showcase opened with epcot in originally hosting only nine country mexico china germany italy united state japan france united kingdom and canada morocco and norway were later added each pavilion offer a disneyfied glimpse of foreign land complete with impressively built recreation of cultural landmark the occasionally racist caricature based ride and of course large gift shop oh and there are stand serving each country 's cuisine and drink that 's where this self indulgent adventure begin when i wa a kid i wa just happy to have my fake disney passport stamped at each country and show off my geographical knowledge to random stranger in funny costume but now it 's time to soil that innocence with some good ol ' fashioned binge drinking drinking 'around the world is a daunting task because it requires the metaphorical backpacker to guzzle down at least eleven alcoholic drink in

before the park close deep inside mexico 's giant replica mayan pyramid there is la cava del tequila an appropriately named cellar offering more than variety of that delicious nectar but this is disney so there 's a long line to get in we 'll come back later norway apparently missed the memo on promoting it native alcoholic beverage because i 'm now drinking an eight dollar cup of carlsberg a

must say i 'm very grateful george miller say a we tuck into a table inside the four season the swanky beverly hill hotel still abuzz from the american film institute 's annual award luncheon where miller 's mad max fury road wa feted a one of the year 's best a week later fury road would pick up ten academy award nomination including best picture today he smile not for the first time or the last during the award season he won the oscar in for his animated flick happy foot and notched nomination for 's lorenzo 's oil and 's babe next month he 'll vie for the first best director nod of his year career this time last year no one expected a blistering pricey post apocalyptic studio action sequel to contend for oscar gold then fury road opened in may wowing critic and audience alike on it way to a million global box office take by year 's end the supercharged flick had roared it way onto best of list lauded a much for it impossible seeming stunt a it searing feminist streak 'the initial idea that came wa to have an extended chase in which we see how much story and subtext'as i like to say the iceberg under the tip'as you could pick up recall miller who first envisioned a

with far fewer strong'or surviving'female character 'it wa n't like 'oh let 's make a feminist action movie ' miller say of fury road 'it came out of the story which wa the notion that one way or another we 're all kind of commodity 'what wa to be in conflict wa to be human the wife needed a road warrior who had to be female'it could n't be male that 's a different story to have an actor like charlize come along and really grab hold of it he admires applauding theron 's performance 'it 's not a big talky role 'it wa a tough movie to make miller admits 'you 're out there in a very remote location doing all this stuff and there are no protracted scene for the actor to sink their teeth into it 's all tiny little bit that go together to make up the mosaic so there 's a high degree of difficulty for the actor 'tough is the understatement of the year it took year for miller to get fury road made even when he wa thisclose to lensing back in then happened sending the american dollar spiraling at one point miller met with heath ledger to star by the time he cast tom hardy in the iconic role in the plan involved not one but two film a live action fury road and an akira style anime exploring furiosa 's tale by the time fury road wa on track to film miller 's original plan had changed drastically his ideal wasteland down under became unfilmable thanks to extreme weather leading the production to shoot in namibia trade issued alarming report of swelling budget a the eight month shoot wore on sparking scuttlebutt of friction on set between star theron and hardy both star and miller acknowledged their on set hostility last year during fury road 's promo tour in the glow of award season perhaps it 's even easier to forgive the tense moment 'i do n't know if there are many people who are so called method but whatever we do a human being if we do it passionately it seeps into your work miller shrug 'you do n't think you 're bringing your work home with you but we do you 're thinking about it you sort of dream about the work it invades your unguarded moment and that particularly applies when you 've got a big marathon like movie so it doe happen with the actor 'in the case of max and furiosa we shot more or le in continuity so you have two character who begin wanting to kill each other who in a very guarded fashion are forced to cooperate and then develop a positive regard for each other it 's almost what happened with the actor a well the sheer size of the million production which employed over crewmembers is what miller remembers keeping him up at night his team pulled off pyrotechnic filled stunt with an armada of custom tweaked wasteland vehicle sans green screen and vfx'that is with a few notable exception like using cg to erase tear on theron 's face in the first chase sequence caused by the dusty desert wind 'one take she said 'i hope people wo n't think i 'm cry because i 'm not ' i said no no he remembers 'i erased them with cg because you can do that i thought i do n't think the audience will think that'but we might a well a figure catch miller 's eye from across the room he apologizes with a bashful smile 'i 'm sorry one guy i 'm really kind of star struck by is breaking bad creator vince gilligan and there he is over there he say his eye lighting up 'i 'm a huge huge admirer of his work 'people come up often and say 'i 'm a filmmaker what should i do ' i say 'you know the best thing you can do watch hour of breaking bad and watch it six time he marvel 'each time watch a different element watch the writing watch the camera watch the sound watch the music watch the performance watch the structure if you do that all hour a number of time and you observe really acutely you 'll learn more about making film than just about anything else 'we all learn by watching movie miller continues 'there 's no other way than by watching great movie and i think seeped into that work is a real respect for film language and using the medium for storytelling this year there are two oscar nominee in the family margaret sixel whom miller married in and ha two son with also edited fury road'her first action movie'and is up for best editing miller remembers how he convinced his wife to cut fury road 'she said 'action movie are not really my thing ' i said 'that 's precisely why i do n't want it to look like every action movie ' he explains 'that wa number one and number two i know my wife and i know how she think he laugh 'i know how she garden i know how she doe everything she 's one of those people who 's very very rigorous she doe a lot of thing extremely well seemingly effortlessly she really can ass stuff quickly and she 's got a very low boredom threshold so anything that 's repetitive really annoys her 'i 've gone from being very male dominant to being surrounded by magnificent woman i ca n't help but be a feminist miller told vanity fair this summer indeed fury road sparked minor outrage this summer among men 's right hothead who saw furiosa 's strong female power a a threat miller laugh away the 'fringe criticism 'i do n't think it got much traction he note 'and the logic did n't hold up he 's slightly le dismissive of backlash voiced by primarily female critic to the tie in comic that explore how furiosa and the five wife escaped immortan joe 's rapey reproductive prison 'i did n't really follow that too much he admits 'i wa n't super involved but i wa involved furiosa remains close to miller 's heart even if there are no official plan to explore her backstory in the spin off film fan are eagerly clamoring for miller clarifies that he may still yet direct a mad max spin off contrary to recently debunked rumor that he 'd be passing the torch ultimately it will be his decision he say what he would look for in a potential rising director he 'll allow is someone 'who really really ha a command of film language but brings something very specific to the work i have a son who 's a musician he 's a guitarist and when he listens to a guitarist he can hear thing he can tell for me it 's the same there are people who are technically good and there are people who have that extra little bit of artistry anyway before he tackle the wasteland again he 's got the itch to make one of two 'smaller quicker film rather than take on another huge studio film'man of steel for example which he turned down year after his justice league movie fell victim to the writer 's strike'the septuagenarian 's got other project on his to do list 'i like the dc universe'all the superhero stories'because basically i realize we 're all in the mythology business in a way they 're the modern incarnation of the greek and roman myth he say 'unfortunately i 've got too many story than i ever will have time to tell of the two project he 's choosing between now 'one of them involves you know visual effect and so on he tease 'i 've said it before but my favorite quote from john lennon is 'life is what happens when you 're making other plan ' i do n't know which one and also i always have a thing that if you talk about it before it 's real you could jinx it i 've always had that feeling because i thought we 'd get mad max done ten year ago so i 'm just grateful we got this film made at this time what interest miller now he say are story like fury road 'in which there 's more to the story than meet the eye 'i do n't make many film miller point out 'i feel a kind of gravitational pull to these story and at a certain point it feel like i do n't have a choice but to get in there and tell the story and you do n't really think too much about the end result particularly while you 're doing it you 're just putting everything you know and whatever skill and basic wisdom you might have accumulated and try to put it into the work 'all of u a storyteller we 're looking at what 's out there and trying to get coherence from all of this massive noise he mus when i ask what theme drive him now a opposed to earlier in his career 'i think that 's one of the reason we have story there are a lot of reason why we tell story and one of them is to find some meaning'or at least an illusion of meaning 'i 'm obviously big on joseph campbell and not just the hero myth he continues 'he wa really the guy who elucidated more than anyone else why we tell story he had a quote which i think is absolutely wonderful it wa from this swahili storyteller who said at the end of each story 'the story ha been told if it wa good it belongs to everybody if it wa bad it wa my fault because i 'm the storyteller ' 'i must say you feel that if somehow you tell a story it go out there and people respond to it to some degree or another you realize that it ha enough meaning to people miller offer 'look at the star war there are people in census in england and i 'm sure around the world who state their religion a jedi and some of that 's joking around but some of it 's serious 'stories he say a twinkle in his eye 'should have a warning sign hazardous material,38079.0

1450,10458499.0,2016-01-31T16:29:00+00:00,president trump is now a possibility and it 's terrifying,like many member of the medium i have spent much of the past six month pretending i have some idea of what will happen in the presidential election specifically i have maintained a sanguine and somewhat bemused certainty that whatever else happens there will be no president trump today with every meaning of this phrase i fear i have been mistaken at this moment with the final de moines register poll in link and considering what i have seen and read about trump 's supporter in iowa and elsewhere it would be foolish to say that president trump is n't a possibility and that is terrifying here are the thing i have said to tamp down the notion that trump could win the nomination 'the establishment republican will rally behind a candidate 'he doe n't speak the language of the evangelical voter 'veterans will see right through him 'he doe n't have a real infrastructure or ground game 'you ca n't win without making significant ad buy 'his negative are too high to get very far 'his supporter are n't dedicated enough to caucus i 'm still holding on to some hope for the last one not since high school have i wished so fervently for a snow day the rest of these assumption have either been falsified or called into significant question you 'll notice i did n't even both listing the numerous thing trump ha said to offend people i have stopped believing it is possible for trump to give offense ' or rather i have stopped believing that giving offense is a reason people would cease to support him all he really need to do is win iowa an increasingly likely outcome after that ' well tell me the first state he 'll lose not new hampshire lead by not south carolina lead by not nevada lead by super tuesday state have been infrequently polled but the two with the biggest delegate prize proportionally distributed have recent result trump lead in georgia by point and in texas the poll of poll ha him closing the gap with ahem native son cruz to just two point in florida he lead by point what 's more poll of a shrinking field seem to suggest that a long a a standard bearer for the establishment remains in the race trump will continue to dominate cruz emerges the victor only in a head to head battle ' a bittersweet indication for cruz that he is not quite a hated by moderate republican a he either claim or should be i will refrain from running through specific general election scenario because she sigh heavily we are not there yet here is where we are the strong possibility that trump will get the gop nomination and that mean that there is a non zero chance that he will win the general election non zero is to say the least le that certain but it 's a greater chance than most political professional have given him up until ' now and non zero is enough to scare the shit out of me rationally a trump primary victory is clearly disturbing but until this week i had n't considered it beyond an uncomfortable commentary on the republican electorate on the way to a certain democratic victory i mean right er right if we ' i ' have been so wrong about trump 's chance at making to the general then i think it 's only appropriate to question all our assumption about his chance nationally i spent much of this week reading and watching interview with trump supporter i 'd taken the previously reported incident of slur and scuffle at rally seriously of course but a distracting voice in my head countered that crowd take on their own personality that protester often intend to provoke response and that besides could you really ascribe the same level of ugliness to everyone surely those response were the extreme of the extreme go read the report put together by cnn it 's a collection of quote left to stand mostly on their own taken not from those kicking and punching and shouting but the rest of the crowd there is nothing new here not really it 's the same ill informed nationalist doggerel a he spout it 's chilling not because it 's somehow more extreme than you thought it 'd be but rather because their complaint are so uniform and matter of fact white american founded this country one year old woman told cnn we are being pushed aside because of the president 's administration and the medium a recent study delivered statistical proof of the mindset only implied by the language trump supporter are attracted to a quality that go beyond 'being a successful businessman they are attracted to his authoritarianism they are in fact in favor of turning authoritarian idea into policy trump voter exhibit statistically significant and substantive authoritarian attitude for example trump voter are statistically more likely to agree that other group should sometimes be kept in their place they support preventing minority opposition once we decide what is right trump supporter kick the fundamental tenet of madisonian democracy to the curb asserting that the right of minority need not be protected from the power of the majority and they are statistically more likely than trump opponent to agree the president should curtail the voice and vote of the opposition when it is necessary to protect the country to put it another way the frightening thing about trump voter is not that they 're angry it 's that they believe they 're right'and they believe they 're winning trump ha to use language trumpkins would likely sneer at empowered them that sense of empowerment matter because the difference between authoritarian and populist is any sense of respect for minority opinion in a world run by authoritarian the only break on unjust behavior is whether you can get away it so now imagine a trump nomination imagine how empowering that would be and to whom there are two prevailing theory for why journalist and data crunchers got trump 's trajectory wrong one argument ha it that trump 's candidacy is a black swan event 'an unprecedented amalgam of unreproducible and unpredictable circumstance simply too weird to have foreseen i like that theory because it let u off the hook somewhat and well it 's not an inaccurate description ' but it 's really more of a description than an explanation what 's more all swan look gray in the rearview mirror the end of trump might look like the rise of nationalism in europe or might look like goldwater 's defeat but it will look like something that ha happened before because everything doe another theory a to pundit ' blinkeredness popular on the right ha it that we in the political world were simply too caught up in our cocktail and tv green room chatter to notice what wa going on out there in 'real america this certainly feel close to the truth there is darkness to be found out there in the rallying around kim davis and the rejection of civil right in houston on the other hand 'real america is multifaceted and self contradictory like most other real thing american show growing support for an increased minimum wage and police body camera and young people have a historically high rate of interracial dating how were we supposed to pick out the authoritarian strain from the progressive one i think we did n't see trump coming because we lacked imagination science fiction ha done a better job at predicting trump 's success than political science ha after all neal stephenson interface describes a candidate guided via the input of real time polling data directly into his brain he even decides to skip a debate dark mirror ha plumbed the phenomenon of a 'joke candidate becoming so popular that the force behind him slip easily into despotism and violence social scientist and journalist imprison themselves behind conventional wisdom and to a lesser extent evidence the dark impulse that fuel trump 's supporter have been mostly invisible to the naked eye sure around the fringe of the tea party and in the twisty bowel of internet comment once could sense the anger and racism but i avoided looking into the abyss and preferred instead to gesture towards the more intelligible gamesmanship of washington insider it 's no secret that trump 's rise ha created history 's longest hot mic moment for the medium we have been caught without a script and the rote truism and filler material that usually fill the awkward silence have proven increasingly inappropriate to the unprecedented tragicomedy playing out before u i now see what my problem wa in discounting trump 's chance i relied on guidance from history and reason these are inadequate defense against the force at work in trump 's rise logic did n't help u foresee him and wo n't work against him we ca n't argue policy we are going to need something more like a patronus i am not endorsing magical thinking belief in no cost shortcut legend and mythical creature are what brought u trump but we will need more than debate a force stronger than fact i suspect we 'll need love love for our country for the people in it for the idea it stand for we have to love our country and what it can be more than trump supporter fear what they believe it 's becoming his power stem from their belief in that darkness and with persistence and patience and heart we 're going to have to make them the light,87554.0

do not seem to have been charged dusty returned to living with his mother then his father then his mother again according to court paper dusty told the government investigator who interviewed him five year later that he had been in mortal dread of his uncle 'when interviewed by federal agent the year old dusty hammond said he feared that when steven hammond learned he had talked to police that steven would come to his front door and kill him the paper said the federal agent had come to ask dusty about fire they believed his uncle and grandfather had set on government owned land adjacent to the ranch dusty told them a story from when he wa and going on his first deer hunt he repeated this account before a federal grand jury and again from the witness stand when his uncle and grandfather were tried for arson dusty said he had heard a number of gunshot after the others in the hunting party proceeded over the top of a hill but that he had neither fired his rifle nor seen any deer he did see what his uncle distributed at the end of the hunt 'steven started handing out box of strike anywhere match and said 'we 're going to light up the whole country on fire ' dusty told the jury he said steve had pointed to a spot on the skyline and told him to head there 'just said 'start lighting them and walk in that direction until you run out ' dusty testified dusty did a bid dropping lighted matched into the grass a he went while his uncle and grandfather and others in the party did the same in different direction he ran out of match and wa turning to rejoin the others when he realized he wa surrounded by flame 'fire wa like knee high to start with and then it'i wa looking trying to figure out where everybody else went and i kind of got like trapped by it he testified 'it came up behind me faster than i expected it to'it wa like over my head foot probably'i thought i wa going to get burned up he dashed down the hill to a rocky stream he said 'there wa mud creek just a little bit of water not much but everything wa green around it so i went down there in the rock and waited for most of the fire to go by he testified dusty eventually reached his grandfather 's pickup truck he said and rode back to the ranch they all sat down to a lunch of egg salad sandwich 'dwight told me to keep my mouth shut that nobody needed to know about the fire dusty testified the prosecutor asked why he had remained silent even long after he wa away from the ranch living with his mother 'i wa afraid of steven and susie he testified 'and i do n't like to talk about it just never said anything about it nobody ever asked 'someone eventually did ask did they not the prosecutor inquired 'yeah dusty replied 'in march of 'yes'there were two of them that come up he wa speaking of the federal agent 'did you tell the agent what you 've been telling the jury today 'yes 'why 'because they asked and i 'm not afraid of steve anymore dusty further testified that his uncle and grandfather had gone up in a private plane later in the day 'said they were going to go fly over and see what the fire did and see if they got rid of the juniper tree and something else duty testified the hammonds would later admit to setting a number of fire saying they had only been doing so a a precaution against a much larger wildfire sweeping through the government would contend that the 'something else they hoped had been burned wa any evidence that they had been poaching deer on federal land they are said to have become concerned when a group of other hunter happened to see them the jury convicted the uncle and grandfather of arson on federal property a counterterrorism statute mandate a five year minimum term for the crime but federal judge michael hogan declared that in these circumstance 'it would be a sentence which would shock the conscience the judge sentenced steve to a year and a day dwight to three month the government appealed and won in 'even a fire in a remote area ha the potential to spread to more populated area threaten local property and resident or endanger the firefighter called to battle the blaze the appeal court held 'given the seriousness of arson a five year sentence is not grossly disproportionate to the offense a re sentencing neared the hammonds submitted a sept letter to the court in which they described themselves a 'dedicated men who are highly regarded in their community the government noted in a sentencing memorandum that the hammonds 'omit any mention of their alleged assault and abuse of their sixteen year old grandson nephew dusty hammond the photo of the twin wound wa entered into evidence along with deputy sheriff neeham 's report the hammonds were sentenced to the mandatory minimum of five year but given until after the holiday to surrender the designated date wa jan the first monday of the new year a the time neared armed member of a so called militia took over a federal building in supposed solidarity with the hammonds steve and dwight had the sense to say the deluded attention seeker did not speak for them on monday the hammonds did indeed surrender they could not be reached for comment nor could dusty the militia member continue their occupation insisting they do so in the name of two rancher they call hero but might be better described a child abuser,154694.0

for the number of people dancing in wooden shoe at one time the iowa town of pella is best known for it namesake window company so you would figure that folk at the home of the pella corporation would remember donald trump 's declaration in that he had been forced to make a yuge order of window from china because he had such difficulty finding any that were made in america 'i ordered window thousand of window the other day they 're made in china trump said during an interview with cnbc 'i do n't want to buy them but it 's hard to get them anywhere else the revelation had caused quite an uproar in the window industry trump had sought to smooth it over with a statement insisting 'i would much rather buy 'u s '' and do much business with pella ' and others the u s product is better 'china 's artificially low currency make it hard for u s company to compete he said at the time in other word trump had bought the chinese window because they were cheaper that translated into greater profit for him and profit is what made trump the really rich guy who had people lined up by the hundred in pella to hear him speak on saturday here is how trump began his speech 'oh pella pella pella i 'm always negotiating the price of those damn window you know trump can be heard saying in a video of the event 'brutal brutal the auditorium filled with cheer 'but they 're good i 'll tell you what he went on 'they 're a great product and we buy a lot of them more cheer 'anybody who work at pella anybody he asked voice responded in the boisterous affirmative 'well you know you have lot of order for trump he said 'they make a quality window and you 're proud to have them he wa not done 'i did n't realize i 'd be speaking in pella i 've paid so much money to them ay i get the shudder to think i 'm here he then turned serious 'but the end result is their product is great the man who six year earlier said he had ordered window by the thousand from china now said 'which is what we want in this country right that 's what we want from the crowd came a cry 'usa trump returned to the subject of window while speaking of donald doubter in particular people who suggested that his financial disclosure form would show he wa not a rich a he claimed to be 'actually it turned out i 'm much richer he said to the crowd 's manifest delight 'i built a great company 'pella know pella know he went on 'those window go someplace and those were successful job neither trump nor the pella corporation responded to request for comment so it is difficult to determine what job he wa speaking about unless he wa applying a trump ian definition of success trump wa not likely talking of his casino in atlantic city an adventure that led to multiple bankruptcy that despite his father fred trump slipping him more than million through a supposed gambling chip purchase at a casino cashier 's cage he certainly wa not referring to whatever building were outfitted with thousand of chinese window which he almost certainly purchased because they were cheaper than american made one such a those pella produce donald trump wa also not likely to have been citing a number of project where he wa not the actual developer but had simply licensed his name to lure investor in two of those project the trump soho and the trump fort lauderdale the building went into foreclosure in two other project the trump tampa and the trump baja the building were never built the local down in baja in mexico must get a pretty good laugh when they hear trump talk about building a wall along the border and then see his smiling face on a billboard overlooking a hole in the ground 'trump ocean resort baja mexico the billboard say 'trump owning here is just the beginning not laughing are the investor who lost million imagining that trump is a synonym for midas his name remains his company 's great asset the first image that appears on his company 's website is of a foreclosed building erected with such business partner a felix sater a russian immigrant with a violent felony conviction who ha previously participated in a multimillion dollar stock fraud linked to the mafia but the building is still the trump soho it still bear the moniker that to some mean bigotry and misogyny but to others mean buck and moxie in another of his foundering deal a mega project on manhattan 's upper west side trump had a partner named vincent lo who wa sometimes called china 's version of the donald lo even hosted an apprentice style reality show called wise man take all lo could never quite pull it off the chinese might be able to make bargain priced window just a they made bargain priced garment that trump sold in clothing line before he got even better price having them made in lesotho but trump is a uniquely american product just ask those good folk in iowa a trump would say pella know,15325.0

you to vote for donald trump because he is the one candidate who point out that we should accept immigrant who are good for america we do n't need muslim we need smart well educated white people who will assimilate to our culture vote trump this jarring message is just one part of a robocall recorded on behalf of donald trump by the american national super pac created by none other than the leader of the american freedom party a prominent white nationalist organization in the last month the political party ' which once tried to revoke the citizenship of every non white inhabitant of the united states'has evolved from supporting trump 's candidacy to formally endorsing him for president that endorsement made american freedom party history since they had never before endorsed a candidate outside of their own rank but the group that represents 'the political interest of white american wa willing to make an exception for the republican frontrunner 'we do have our own candidate but bob whitaker our candidate ha told u that it is alright to endorse donald trump the american freedom party 's leader william daniel johnson explained in an interview with the daily beast he first tried to register the group with the fec a the american national trump super pac in november of last year but wa prohibited from naming it this because the pac is not a committee authorized by trump 's campaign a spokesman for trump did not respond for a request for comment for this article johnson subsequently submitted an amended statement of organization to the fec on january changing the name to the american national super pac just three day before the call began in iowa he also created thedailytrump org complete with a logo depicting the candidate 's swooping golden lock devoted exclusively to story about trump but iowan have the pleasure of hearing not only johnson 's voice on the opposite end of the telephone but also filipino american reverend ronald tan and jared taylor a spokesman for the council of conservative citizen which among other thing wa cited a the group which inspired charleston church shooter dylann roof 'i think really it ha to do with a nagging sense that white american have that their country is really slipping through their finger taylor said when asked why he got involved 'people realize that the united state is changing and it 's changing in a way that they find disagreeable and it ha enormously to do with a change in demographic it 's becoming a third world country taylor who surmise that most white american want a white only nation ha sung the praise of trump in the past writing in his own publication the american renaissance that 'this could be the last chance white have to vote for a president who could actually do something useful for them and for their country he ha also concluded in past writing that 'blacks and white are different when black are left entirely to their own device western civilization'any kind of civilization'disappears his organization is the modern iteration of the white citizen council which fought against desegregation in southern school in the s and s it ha referred to african american a a 'retrograde specie of humanity and opposes 'efforts to mix the race of mankind taylor said he recorded his part of the robocall upon johnson 's request and he would consider joining trump 's campaign if asked to do so 'it 's marvelously refreshing to find a fella who shoot from the hip taylor said describing his fandom 'can you imagine jeb bush saying something that would actually surprise you seeing a the pac is very new johnson doe n't have a long term strategy with it a of yet he 's put in of his own money and is willing to put in more depending on how well this round of robocalls performs in getting trump an iowa caucus win 'i think it 's a foregone conclusion that trump will be the nominee and the president johnson confidently said 'i think he will probably not win iowa unless my effort are successful while these call might ring a unwanted and riddled with problematic language to iowa voter the federal election commission 's hand are really tied when it come to dealing with the content of robocalls according to deputy press officer christian hilland the only time that the fec is made aware of the existence of robocalls is when a pac spends or more and ha to file an independent expenditure report 'that would be beyond the scope of our regulation hilland said when asked if the fec would police any unsavory content in political robocalls 'you 'd probably have to look at something like the doj the department of justice did not respond to a request for comment about whether it had been made aware of the content of these call geoff greenwood communication director for the iowa attorney general told the daily beast that 'there 's no screening process when it come to the distribution of political robocalls in the state according to federal communication commission standard the call are qualified a protected free speech if they go to a landline if a cell phone receives the call the user ha to have given express permission to receives call at that number a representative for the fcc told the daily beast that detail of any complaint could only be obtained through the freedom of information act but at least one expert said that the content of the call could stoke hatred among listener 'these robocalls are too brief to engage in a complicated critique of their use of hate dr michael s waltman a professor at the university of north carolina who specializes in hate speech told the daily beast 'but they do manipulate the hatred of potential listener jared taylor 's comment directly state that muslim are not good for america and that they are not good for america because they are muslim he even suggests that muslim are not well educated when he claim that we should only admit well educated people to the country there are no legal limit if johnson want to expand these call to new hampshire which is something he 's considering unless someone file a complaint with the fcc which mean there could be a lot more of johnson and his friend throughout the month a the first primary nears those friend include reverend ronald tan who immigrated to the united state in the s and now support trump 's immigration policy 'i have nothing against building the wall tan told the daily beast 'there 's a lot of danger right now with an open ended policy i really want to safeguard the process in term of more stringent background check it 's very difficult given the kind of world that we live in right now where terrorism and radical islam ha permeated even social medium tan who said that he get invited to church 'all the time ha no specific place of ministry and rather practice it 'through a radio program at the moment that show called 'for god and country and co hosted by johnson is set to air on an iowa radio station from january january in order to provide voter with 'christian and nationalist reason to support donald trump according to a press release from the american freedom party for now this ragtag group of white nationalist can only hope that they are playing a part in what they view a a historical moment in american politics 'if you were born in the united state and suddenly find that you are living in an outpost of guatemala or haiti or nicaragua or vietnam you 're going to be angry taylor said describing the changing demographic of the country in trump voter 'see a man who say 'hold on let 's look over some of these people who are coming maybe some of them are rapist maybe some of them are murderer maybe some of these muslim really are undesirable simply having said that is a huge earthquake in

outbuilding where i work too spent to climb up onto the leather chair where for year or so he ha drowsed while i peck away at the key it 's raining outside and a deer walk past not foot away and the dog lift his eyebrow enough to cause his forehead to wrinkle into furrow and then drop his chin back onto his paw and go back to wherever he wa it 's strange to imagine but inside him there is a storm the speed of it seems impossible three week ago'a day or two more now'he wake me up in the night panting we head into the kitchen and i offer him some fresh water he turn it down and stand by the door and after i let him out he drink rainwater from mr dexter 's flowerpot then he lie down on the porch for half an hour cooling off and i sit by the door reading and at or so he come back in three hour previous back before the first time we went to bed i 'd cleaned the goop that run out of the inside corner of his eye a i do every night that wa midnight at a m the stuff is back two inch long and darker than before he is a pale lab almost white and in the dim light the stain are there again running from the corner of his eyes'which are almost black'and together with the line of goop look like old fashioned keyhole he take a shot at getting up on the bed and miss scrambling at the edge of the mattress looking for some purchase for his hind foot and then drop hard back onto the floor i pile pillow beside the bed and cover them with a sheet and in the five or second before i am back in bed myself he is snoring in the morning he turn down breakfast it take a minute for this news to settle henry is turning down food this is exactly a likely a finding him down by the river playing a harmonica friday afternoon dr parent take the dog 's vital sign a they say and then pull some blood for test and then examines the entire creature running his hand up and down his coat the dog pant and lick at a few drop of spilled water on the examination table dr parent doe not like what he is feeling and all there is to say about the next minutes'if there is something more to this story than the end of a dog'it is that what you do when there 's nothing you can do can matter for a long time henry continues not to eat i stir fry chicken he ca n't stomach the smell in the morning'it 's saturday now'i fry a reduced for quick sale ounce boneless rib eye steak rare enough meat on that plate to run for president and he turn away a couple of hour later i try a ounce fancy feast chicken heart liver feast in gravy sliced gourmet cat food which come out of the can whole quivering like jell o and which the animal ha in the past swallowed in it entirety while i have turned away for the half second it take to call the cat but not this time this time he ca n't eat and i know about that oddly enough we have been through this before henry and i except last time i wa the one who wa supposed to die i 'd been bitten by a dog'not henry by the way'a puppy who got excited while we were playing'and the infection settled in my spine first and then spread everywhere into joint and many of my favorite organ ten week in the hospital most of it at what wa a called a select care facility in phoenix it wa a bad time'hallucinations depression nightmares'all the connection to the regular world fading and the world particularly the nursing staff wa amazingly indifferent and without going through the sorry story of that hospital i would mention that truly horrible people reveal themselves when you are helpless and expected to die any day in any case part of it a small part wa not being able to eat meaning i understand what the dog is feeling now you understand but ca n't actually remember i suppose ' not until it 's on you again sunday night i talk him into a few bite of american cheese and a mint patty later'back around a m 'we move to the outbuilding where my office is and a spare bed so a not to awaken mr dexter anymore than we already have mr dexter ha over the year developed an unfriendly response to being stirred at this hour knowing from a lifetime of experience that good news doe not come at in the morning meanwhile over in the outbuilding office we leave the door open so the beast can come and go a he want the outside temperature ha dropped into the low s and inside the temperature ha also dropped into the low s and this time i lift the dog into bed because without him i will freeze on friday before he stopped eating henry weighed in at pound at dr parent 's office and whatever he weighs now my lifting him into bed is like the story you see now and then where grandma lift the studebaker off junior when it fall off the jack monday the test result come in stage four lymphoma and you only get five stage the vet'a different vet a cancer specialist'says that if the chemotherapy work henry might last another year a good year maybe chemo is easier on dog than it is on people at least until it come back and it will come back she is pretty clear about that and next time it wo n't work a well or for a long and it will go on a year maybe more if you 're lucky and in the end the cancer is going to win and a week and a half go by chemotherapy every tuesday pill every morning checking his temperature last night he wa strong enough to get back up on the bed but we are still sleeping in the office and i am sitting here thinking of arizona of the afternoon i finally got out of the last hospital and wa sitting in a wheelchair waiting for mr dexter to bring the car around when instead she walk in holding henry on a leash he see me and tear himself and the leash out of her hand he ha been in a kennel week a hundred pound of bone and muscle with a yard head start and i am in a wheelchair emaciated down to not much bigger than the dog and in that moment'equal part relief happiness and terror'i wa back among the living a for henry i do n't know what he wa thinking then'i never claimed this wa the smartest animal in the world'or what he 's thinking now he 's better today than yesterday though and wa better yesterday than the day before and according to the vet that is how it will probably go day after day until it

widespread outrage in shiite muslim community across the middle east and especially in iraq protest were organized in baghdad fed by social medium one video wa shared that allegedly showed the last second of nimr 's life and his execution another widely shared video showed nimr 's body being dropped out of a helicopter after the execution some iraqi even said he wa thrown out of that helicopter while still alive this kind of 'news is common on iraqi social medium and it 's dangerous because for many iraqi social medium website like facebook twitter youtube and to a lesser degree instagram have become a major source of political and security related news they do not trust mainstream medium in iraq which is mostly considered to be partisan with much of it funded by political party religious body or other organization pushing their own agenda many iraqi say their most trusted source of news is word of mouth'relatives friend neighbors'so it make sense that they would turn to social medium basically an expanded word of mouth network to get information they believe they can trust however once again the country 's ingrained social division are playing a part on social medium site too manipulated video photoshopped picture and other false news and disturbing rumor are shared continuously by iraqi craving information and in some case anything that confirms their own bias the story about sheikh nimr 's execution wa a prime example of this it 's hard to know who posted the video originally but it seems clear that the original user had an agenda under the guidance open source verification expert at the investigative network bellingcat a team of blogger from the iraqi network for social medium who are also the founder of a facebook page called fake post and journalist from niqash took a closer look at some of these falsified report on social medium using open source verification technique like geolocation and reverse image search the team quickly found that the first video the one allegedly showing al nimr 's execution had nothing to do with the saudi cleric the clip watched by thousand of iraqi wa actually the video of the execution of an indonesian maid in saudi arabia and it wa four year old the other video that supposedly showed al nimr 's body being thrown out of a helicopter after his execution wa also something else it wa a video showing a member of saudi police force falling out of a helicopter most likely to his death in the investigator then went on to look at several other popular rumor doing the round of iraqi social medium another picture that caused a different kind of uproar wa that of a bloodied soldier with the remains of a mortar embedded in his arm alive and sitting on a bed interestingly enough every single group fighting in iraq wanted to claim this 'hero a one of their own the iraqi kurdish military known a the peshmerga said he wa one of their men the iraqi army claimed him a their soldier and then the shiite muslim volunteer militia who may or may not fight alongside the iraqi army said he wa one of their brave volunteer even the extremist islamic state or isi got in on the act saying he wa actually one of their fighter people in iraq want to believe this kind of story and they gave the soldier with the mortar in his arm nickname like 'iron man in honor of his survival but once again it turned out that nothing about this picture wa correct the man wa in fact a soldier in the colombian army in south america the picture dated back to and the man had been injured while the colombian army wa fighting local left wing rebel the revolutionary armed force of colombia farc detail on the remains of the mortar in the man 's arm word on his badge saying quimbaya his military rank and other news report on the incident quickly made it clear that the soldier had nothing to do with iraq at all another controversy wa caused by a picture that seemed to show an officer from the iraqi kurdish military consorting with member of the isi group a force that the iraqi kurdish are supposed to be fighting back in when isi first took over the northern city of mosul there were already rumor that the iraqi kurdish were cooperating with the group in order to gain advantage and move toward a long cherished goal of kurdish independence no big surprise then that this picture of supposed enemy together relaunched those rumor in the echo chamber that is iraqi social medium once again though this wa misinformation the individual who looked like he wa a member of isis'sporting a long beard and a typical long shirted isi outfit'turned out to be an actor well known in iraqi kurdistan but not by arab audience in iraq he wa in an area west of mosul working on a film about how isi had attacked the yazidi minority in northern iraq and the member of the iraqi kurdish military pictured with the actor wa a real soldier a member of the security task force assigned to protect the film crew and actor it seemed that the picture had been taken a a kind of celebrity souvenir and uploaded in that vein but had then been taken out of context by those who did n't recognize the kurdish actor and who had suspicion about the iraqi kurdish military it is not just ordinary iraqi on social medium spreading rumor and gossip the iraqi medium also disseminates these kind of story to increase audience share and get more visitor to their site they know these controversial report will do that for some of the le scrupulous more partisan medium outlet the false story may also support their organization 's agenda digital content that set one sect or ethnic group against another in iraq is seen a popular a bit like the populist muck raking done by tabloid in the west it often spread very quickly ' which make even more professional news outlet want to re publish or comment on it 'the best way to confront this kind of news is to better train iraqi journalist suggests hashim hassan al tamimi dean of the college of mass communication at the university of baghdad 'iraqis urgently want news about security and about politics the real medium should be able to provide them with this information instead of allowing rumor on social medium to incite hatred this report wa prepared by niqash in cooperation with bellingcat the medium academy iraq and iraqi member of the fake post page,5439.0

then glenn frey which left u all feeling guilty because we 'd made more joke about the eagle than they ever deserved henley and the gang you were sort of awesome we admit it now and dutifully apologize hell even grizzly adam wa a blow le noted wa the death of robert stigwood who managed the bee gee and produced saturday night fever but the fact of his passing did not escape me i 've had a kind of secret stake in mr stigwood 's doings for the past year going back roughly to the release of the bee gee ' album main course which represented their first foray into disco and which produced the no hit 'jive talkin ' and 'nights on broadway the latter of which a it so happens might have saved my writing career therefore i feel a personal 'thank you to mr stigwood and the bee gee is in order along with an explanation in my hometown of sandpoint idaho in there were three kind of guy guy who hated the bee gee guy who secretly liked the bee gee but pretended to hate them guy who got their as kicked every day i wa a lowly high school freshman that year doing the same thing a the other freshmen'attempting to look cool while remaining a inconspicuous a possible this seemed like the safest way to navigate freshman year i wa pretty firmly in category above though i lived in constant fear of somehow being found out and slipping disastrously into category case in point when saturday night fever with it predominately bee gee soundtrack finally made it to our local movie theater the panida a gang of u fourteen year old smarta decided to go make fun of it we were n't old enough to drive so we had to walk several block from my friend bryan czarapata 's house the movie wa released in december of ' but it did n't get to u until january by which time we 'd already heard all the song on the radio and learned to hate them appropriately see above'and bryan 's mother had given him a red satin jacket for christmas this jacket introduced an element of risk while disco fashion were not ridiculed with a much zest a disco itself'we all owned at least one pair of hash jean and at least one wide collared polyester shirt'it wa still safest to go with levi s and a down vest or jacket bryan wa living dangerously in other word and on the way to the theater he wa struck a devastating blow'his jacket when seen under the streetlight turned a shade that could only be called hot pink so much scorn wa heaped upon bryan and his hot pink john travolta disco jacket a it quickly came to be called that we had none left for the film to this day at every high school reunion the story of the pink disco jacket is hauled out like an ax to chop my friend bryan into tiny piece that we feed to the trophy size trout in lake pend oreille the movie turned out to be great of course you could walk around the hall shouting 'hey do n't hit the hair without fear of reprisal but you still had to hate the brother gibb'even more in fact when another one of them andy seemingly materialized out of thin air singing song that only our little sister could love we were terrified by the thought that yet another even younger bee gee might at any moment come staggering out of the australian bush warbling in falsetto never mind that you caught yourself humming to 'night fever on kspt the local am radio station or that you got tear in your eye a you danced with tammi evans who wa not only gorgeous but a senior to 'more than a woman on the day they made everyone learn 'the hustle in gym class in north idaho in the bee gee and disco in general still sucked'hating disco wa a survival skill imagine my surprise then when thirty odd year later barry maurice and robin showed up to rescue the novel i wa writing i had made the mistake of trying to read proust while i wa working on it and thing had come to a screeching halt there wa a lot of proust to wade through and not a lot of writing getting done and i eventually began to hope the book would simply write itself there it sat day after day all or so page of it staring at me from the coffee table a thin film of dust or possibly mildew accumulating on the title page it sat there so long that my year old son who never read anything picked it up and gave it a go he pronounced it not entirely bad and asked me when it would be finished i wa tempted to say never so then i wa staying for a couple of day with a friend of mine the writer john mcnally john had the coolest basement ever with a jukebox and an old refrigerator stuffed with craft beer and about cat that all managed to remain hidden somewhere john had just purchased the jukebox and wa in the process of stocking it with s he wa telling me some of the record he 'd ordered one of which wa the bee gee ' 'nights on broadway which came out before we were required to hate disco in north idaho and which i had loved when i wa year old since john did n't have the yet he showed me a youtube video of the bee gee singing 'nights on the midnight special which for those not old enough to remember wa kind of a poor man 's mtv before mtv existed with band supposedly performing their latest hit 'live though they were mostly lip synced to the studio recording 'nights on broadway is one of the show 's most fascinating actual live performance bee gee fan will note the absence of the soaring falsetto line of the studio version'since barry sang both the lead and the falsetto on the record maurice had to take a crack at it live singing both his own harmony vocal from the record and occasionally venturing into barry 's impossibly high and clear range with mixed result robin 's performance is touchingly earnest a usual he sings with one hand cupped over his right ear a if to hear his own voice better and during the instrumental break diligently executes what must certainly be the most awkward set of dance move of the entire disco era i became a sucker for the song all over again i ventured out to the local record store in search of the bee gee and came home with gulp the soundtrack to saturday night fever standing there at the turntable i hesitated this wa the moby dick of disco the great white whale we my friend and i had been intent once on hunting down and slaughtering 'staying alive 'that unmistakably horrifying and supremely indelible opening beat the retina searing image of john travolta strutting down that brooklyn avenue paint can in hand 'how deep is your love 'if i ca n't have you disco ball and strobe lit dance floor and pink satin jacket i closed my eye dropped the needle and promptly got my as kicked every song wa a perfect little gem if side wa n't the best album side of the entire decade it wa pretty damn close to reject this stuff you had to reject the entire genre the entire movement'which of course i realized wa exactly what we 'd done a bunch of teenage guy in idaho four wheeling in somebody 's pickup truck our first beer can clutched in our fist disco belonged to someone else somewhere far away the music of a suspect big city culture of discotheque and designer drug and trendy fashion sexually ambiguous and mysteriously multicultural which we watched with disdain every saturday morning on american bandstand and no doubt keenly envied it wa winter in south carolina where i live now and it wa nighttime and my family had gone to bed and i stood at the window listening to 'more than a woman and i admit i got all teary eyed in the same way i had in gym class on that day long ago when i danced with tammi evans in proust 's remembrance of thing past the narrator unlocks a flood of memory when he bite into a madeleine the flavor reminding him of childhood day when he had eaten the same treat at his family 's cottage in the french countryside a two thousand page novel ensues i wa n't going that far but i had found my madeleine during the day fueled by my newly discovered nostalgia for disco the page of the novel accumulated rapidly in the early morning or late at night when i had the house to myself i read proust with the record player on while proust described the girl on the beach at balbec alicia bridge sang about how much she loved the night life while the fictional marcel schemed to hold the elusive albertine captive in his paris apartment anita ward reminded me that i could always ring her bell the music'the same music that i had pretended to hate and tried to ignore and left behind forgotten'now not only seemed appealing and fresh to me but threw open window on my past so that i could feel again even if only for a moment like i did when i wa assigned the perfect dance partner that day in gym class and in recapturing those moment i gained entry into those same feeling on the part of my character an emotional level that i wa n't reaching before character have past joy and regret just like real people do and discovering them sometimes mean reliving your own past'not the incident so much but the feeling evoked by them my oldest son is a musician'he creates electronic music and make hip hop beats'and i wa discussing with him recently in very general term the difference between the music 'now and the music 'then i mentioned how he and my younger son would listen to a song for a day or two and then i would never hear it again i lamented the fact that all the new music seemed disposable'existing in the ether for only a nanosecond never even achieving a physical form like the album i could pick up and put on the record player much le the enduring form of memory he said basically that i wa old and i wa missing the point'the music wa supposed to be disposable there wa so much out there that you could always move on to something new why listen to the same thing over and over again i had been fooled by the western musical tradition into believing there wa such a thing a a 'timeless classic touche i said and cued up a hot chocolate album i 'd just found in the dollar bin the one featuring 'you sexy thing and i disappeared in a swirling fog of dry ice into david bowie glenn frey robert stigwood'they 're all gone now and the ' s were a long time ago but for me and others of my generation they stay vivid and near maybe memory is our best compensation for growing old i 'm past the half century mark now and i know a thing or two about getting older although a my father who also passed away recently used to tell me there are a few thing i do n't know yet i might not be in tune to everything new but i 've got a lifetime of memory to draw on when i need a boost maybe that 's what art is all about it offer something sustaining and yes permanent'at least in the mind of the one who store it up and treasure it'that we carry with u a our life move forward our time grows shorter but our memory are long in other word the bee gee have my back maybe

display of public execution today saudi arabia executed people which is the biggest mass execution in the kingdom since the early s this follows a blood soaked in which the country executed people the highest number in two decade and a increase from the year before despite that staggering sum with their action today the second of january saudi arabia is already almost a third of their way to beating last year 's abysmal record indeed this strict sunni wahhabi religious kingdom one of the few absolute monarchy left in the world still stage public execution crucifixion and flogging the death penalty is applied in a wide range of case including apostasy terrorism ' and witchcraft though most of those killed today were accused of terrorism one must remain incredibly skeptical about the justice system of a country in which even atheism is deemed a terrorist offense by law among those killed today wa ayatollah al nimr nimr wa a vocal saudi shia opposition cleric who publicly criticized the ruling al saud family and called for election in nimr said that he favored protest over violence the weapon of the word is stronger than bullet because authority will profit from a battle of weapon the saudi interior ministry however accused him of being behind attack on police and allying with another regional theocracy shia iran in fact saudi arabia 's regional tension with iran ha reached such level that it is prepared to countenance the execution of minor a year old relation of al nimr ha been sentenced to crucifixion'his headless corpse to be displayed in public for several day and abdullah al zaher who wa when he wa arrested also awaits beheading this make him the youngest person so far to be sentenced to death beyond execution nobel prize nominee raif badawi a blogger who started the free saudi liberal forum in ha been convicted of insulting islam and given a year prison term with lash and a lujain al hathloul 's and maysa al amour 's imprisonment show woman still ca n't drive in saudi arabia nor apparently can they use social medium to complain about being unable to drive meanwhile neighbouring yemen ha been carpet bombed to oblivion by the house of saud that one of our closest ally could maintain such an appalling human right record should be a matter of deep shame to america and great britain in today 's information age this barbaric track record can no longer be hidden from view under increasing pressure the uk ministry of justice dropped a large contract to train saudi prison staff this decision wa initially opposed by prime minister cameron who only reversed track after facing a sustained human right campaign to his credit justice secretary michael gove backed the move and here 's the rub while iran is no better through saudi arabia the absurdity of our global alliance are laid bare this medieval throwback of a regime'our ally'believes in and enforces many of the same punishment a those they are helping u to fight isi a this graphic show punishment for apostasy blasphemy homosexual act treason'which could mean anything from organizing political opposition to act of militancy adultery fornication highway robbery and banditry are identical under saudi law a well a under isi rule in both case these punishment are justified by a medieval take on islamic scripture just a isi doe a saudi interior ministry statement issued today began with passage from the quran and cited prophetic tradition in order to justify the mass execution the grand mufti sheikh abdulaziz al al sheikh appeared on television soon after to describe the killing a just and fawzi al zafzaf a scholar from egypt 's highest sunni authority al azhar welcomed the execution by saying 'saudi arabia ha applied the law of god among the prophetic tradition cited by saudi 's interior ministry wa one from the book of sahih muslim 'whoever come to you while your affair are united and want to disunite you sowing dissension amongst you kill him how funny just like isi i had used this same hadith during my day a a committed islamist arguing for the necessity of forcibly unifying all muslim behind a global caliph and overthrowing the saudi regime a an obstacle to such unity and here 's the rub the islamic state group seek to enforce a totalitarian version of islam over society the islamic republic of iran claim it already enforces islam and fight the 'islamic state ' by supporting the party of allah'or hizbollah to do so saudi arabia claim that the islamic republic of iran the party of allah and the islamic state group have got it all wrong and that they enforce the true version of islam in their kingdom monty python 's judean people 's front would be bitingly proud until we recognize that the ideology calling for any version of islam to be imposed over people is wreaking havoc in the region and holding entire society back from progress the middle east stand little chance of recovering from the turbulence it currently face saudi arabia just happens to be one of the wealthiest most organized and most active proponent of this idea and like homophobe hating their closet gay side the saudi have threatened to sue anyone who compare them to isi so sue me,33961.0

luxury hotel in mali in november photograph of the killer showed some of them to be boy in their early teen after the nov attack in bamako the malian capital which al qaeda in the islamic maghreb aqim and it offshoot al mourabitoun said they carried out an image on mali state television showed two young men alleged to be the author of the incident that killed at least people mostly foreign national then last friday the same aqim group unleashed another batch of young militant on burkina faso 's popular splendid hotel and a neighboring cafe in the capital ouagadougou killing people including eight burkinabes six canadian three ukrainian three french and an american on monday the jihadist published photograph of three adolescent men said to have carried out the ouagadougou attack they wore military uniform held kalashnikov and were given the name battar al ansari abu muhammad al buqali al ansari and ahmed al fulani al ansari the jihadist released no further detail but al ansari is a nom de guerre that usually designates somebody from northern mali the name might equally have been used to indicate where the 'brigade is based or originates from two of the adolescent men in the photograph were black and another wa fairskinned suggesting he might be from an arab or tuareg group the various islamist faction in mali'where these young jihadist certainly have roots'are notorious for recruiting adolescent soldier into their rank and forcing them to commit act of violence one such young militant wa seydou who is now year old the teenager wa week shy of his th birthday when he joined al qaeda backed militant fighting to take control of northern mali he had been handed to the jihadist by his parent men working for the militant told seydou 's mother and father that the government wa giving out monies to family who agreed to send their child to quran school to receive an islamic education the militant paid money to seydou 's parent which the boy said wa in hundred of thousand of cfa franc equivalent to a few hundred u s dollar thus by his account they were deceived into handing their only son to a terrorist group in fact hundred if not thousand of malian child have been sold to armed group by family member or school official in exchange for money in other case the child themselves may have been lured in by money and the appeal of 'fighting for god especially after indoctrination in religious school girl often are bought or abducted to become the wife of combatant in the united nation added mali to it child soldier list of shame since more than percent of mali 's million people are child there is a large pool from which to recruit the country 's jihadist also take advantage of a common tradition in west africa where parent and guardian mostly in rural muslim area send their child away to the far city for an islamic education particularly if they ca n't afford to pay for school fee or provide meal seydou used to carry an ak during his time with the militant who have terrorized northern mali since now he sleep rough living in senegal a one of thousand of child who ply the street of the country begging for food and money i met seydou when he wa walking with a bowl in his hand in search of alms along with a couple of teenage boy in one of dakar 's bustling neighborhood i wa told by my contact in dakar that i would find child trafficked from neighboring mali guinea and guinea bissau at the city 's 'downtown and there indeed i met dozen of child at different location and spent hour speaking to those who had a story to tell seydou is one of ten of thousand of talib s'from arabic word for pupil a local variant of the word taliban used in afghanistan they are sent up to hundred of kilometer away from home to gain religious instruction at the classroom or daaras madrassas where a quranic teacher or marabout traditionally instructs the child on how to read the quran seydou led me to a quiet space far enough away that other passersby wo n't hear the story he would tell i wa able to get an interpreter a the boy spoke in the local wolof language which he had learned on the street when he began to speak i could sense the fear in him seydou said he had just returned from playing football with his friend in mali when he saw his parent sitting outside their family house with two strange men my father did n't even let me enter the house when he asked me to follow the men that will take me to my new quranic teacher he said 'i did n't argue it wa my dream to learn the quran so i hurried to follow him in addition to the money his parent got seydou wa told he could earn franc about a day for himself and franc a month for his family in a region stricken by poverty that wa a massive sum especially for a boy his age but the story changed once he wa taken from his home seydou and other recruit were taken to a two week long training session at a camp in mali 's vast desert where they learned the rudiment of shooting the jihadist gave seydou a new name 'abu bakr 'they said we had to learn how to protect ourselves and our brother and sister before learning anything else he recalled 'we did n't have a choice once money ha been paid on your head you have no voice across northern mali jihadist have bought over child from rural community devastated by poverty and hunger although the conflict in the country began in early it wa not until that the act of recruiting child soldier by militant became public knowledge seydou who joined up with mali 's northern jihadist in said some fighter were also recruited from the south of the country where militant group became active last year and from neighboring burkina faso and niger all through his time a a militant seydou said he only played supporting role behind the front line and denies killing anyone or committing any right abuse but he admits receiving money occasionally from the jihadist especially after running errand mali 's jihadist particularly the group known a mujao fund themselves through kidnapping and lucrative trafficking activity and can afford to pay well seydou said the militant gave child military training and religious indoctrination and that his instructor were arab but he did n't know under which name the group operated child soldier are being used by all the armed group operating in mali 's northern region but the islamist group ansar dine aqim and now al mourabitoun have been among the most prominent recruiter 'they showed u different type of weapon and how to use them in case of attack he said 'our instructor told u that when we shoot at the enemy it wa n't u doing so but our creator many of seydou 's childhood friend have left their home and are now working for mali 's militant in the north of the country a greater number are motivated by money but seydou said they are a few who are not moved by the bonus rather 'they want to work for god 'our instructor kept telling u that death is sweeter when it is for god he said 'because of what they often said many child were just waiting for the jihad trained child are used to staff checkpoint conduct foot patrol guard prisoner prepare food for senior militant and implement the punishment prescribed by sharia law when seydou wa asked to attack the timbuktu jail which would have seen him earn additional cash he declined and instead found a way to escape while on an attack mission with member of the group in timbuktu 'i did n't want to be a fighter i wanted to get an islamic education he said 'i ran away because i did n't have the heart to kill or punish anyone seydou wa scared of returning to his parent a he feared the militant would trace him to his home instead he decided search for a marabout who he will work for while also receiving quran lesson the boy walked through the wilderness for hour before arriving at timbuktu 's main town and meeting a marabout who pushed him to another quran teacher in the south in what wa the beginning of his long journey to his current abode seydou had no idea he had become a victim of mali 's thriving child trafficking trade even if he knew what wa going on the prospect of realizing his long held dream of getting a quranic education wa far more appealing to him than ending up in a militant 's camp from mali he wa taken to bafata in guinea bissau and then farther east in the country to gabu where he worked on a cotton field for a brief period before crossing the border into senegal on getting to senegal he wa passed to another marabout in the southwestern city of ziguinchor and later moved to another marabout in dakar where he learned the quran and the local vernacular wolof a trafficking in person report published by the u s department of state indicates that malian child are transported to senegal and guinea for forced labor in gold mine and to cote d'ivoire for forced labor on cotton and cocoa farm in senegal for instance there is a thriving culture of street begging and forced labor and the country 's porous border make it relatively easy for child to be trafficked into the country another state department report on trafficking revealed that senegal is a source transit and destination country for child and woman who are subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking not long ago the government discovered that thousand of child who do not speak wolof were being smuggled into senegal from neighboring country by people impersonating marabout and using the kid to beg for their personal gain the government then announced the repatriation of all non senegalese talib s and banned child begging on the street and all daaras throughout the country but conflict at the time in neighboring mali and guinea bissau and pressure from the islamic community forced president macky sall to rescind the expulsion order now thousand of child like seydou are made to face the prospect of life a beggar or a modern day slave 'even though i survive through begging i have found peace in dakar seydou said 'at least here i would n't have to kill anyone,2531.0

individual whose team 's overall value may just have been upped by about million the fuzzy end of the financial lollipop here is going to the taxpayer given that 'the city county and state still owe a combined million to pay off st louis ' edward jones dome it 's worth noting that fund expended on publicly financed stadium do not lead to economic growth in the long run st louis is better off avoiding the million they were about to fork over to build a shiny new palace for kroenke but that 's cold comfort to the people who will take an immediate economic hit not just the individual who worked for the ram but the ancillary business that thrived on gameday the surrounding bar restaurant and hotel it 's not the same a the removal of an entire team but a a point of comparison after lebron james returned to cleveland 'bar owner near the arena have seen a to percent increase in revenue on game night business insider reported 'bartenders and waitress that would normally be laid off until the summer are being kept on the payroll in addition demand for local hotel room are up percent from the same period last year compared to the national average increase of percent that 's what 's worrying patrick o'neill the bartending manager of flannery 's pub a sport bar located on washington avenue and close to the edward jones dome 'it 's definitely going have a significant decrease he told the daily beast 'all these game you could definitely tell from friday 'til sunday we would pretty much triple our business for that weekend especially with all of the out of town guest coming in they 'd pretty much be in here from friday night all the way up until game time sunday o'neill is n't sure what the bar can do in order to make up for the lost revenue especially with the opening day of the nfl season still seven month away but 'we 're definitely going to have to think of something he said the over under bar grill is similarly located on washington avenue and wa ' percent packed on game day ten day a year between two preseason game and two regular season game brian mcafee the bar 's general manager said 'those ten day are now obviously gone so we 've lost that mcafee is hopeful that there 's a ready made solution namely that the st louis convention center which includes the edward jones dome will be now be free to book large three to five day convention from september through december month that were unavailable due to the ram ' presence 'everything that the convention center folk tell me is that it 'll be better for the bar and restaurant down here he said that may be wishful thinking the daily beast spoke with heywood sander a professor of public administration at the university of texas at san antonio and the author of convention center folly when told of the st louis convention visitor commission 's optimism he chuckled 'no no no sander said 'every cvb convention and visitor bureau in the country say that but st louis is home to one of the great convention center flop saga sander explained that two older hotel were renovated to construct a plus room hotel based on the idea that 'once we get this marriott renaissance hotel we 're going to see a big boost in our convention business he said the result after promising to double the total room night a figure representing the total number of individual spending a single night at a hotel from in to in 'well lo and beyond thing did n't quite work out that way sander said st louis hosted major convention in after the hotel wa built 'how did they do in sander asked ' how did they do in and how did they do in bondholder foreclosed the hotel taking ownership in it eventually sold 'for about cent on the dollar sander said and it 's not like the ram ' presence during the nfl season wa driving away business the edward jones dome itself represents a fraction of the total convention space and 'for most convention you do n't want to be on the floor of a big dome it 's not a particularly functional space sander said 'could they try to sell that space of course he continued 'but what they 're not telling you is what the convention market is nationally and nationally right now the convention business is marked by a glut of space it 's seriously overbuilt most major city are doing is giving their convention space away for free in that kind of market st louis doe n't have a great likelihood of doing much better even if the city did see a bump in convention that wo n't replace 'the ten of thousand of people who are coming to the game on a regular basis that 's the distinction that 's really crucial he said it 's not going to solve st louis ' current financial woe but senator claire mccaskill is vowing to do something to lessen the odds that the next municipality will be left holding the bag a spokesperson from mccaskill 's office told the daily beast that the process of crafting legislation is currently underway and the goal is 'to ensure community are treated fairly in the event that a professional sport team that benefit from public fund such a playing in a stadium financed by the public decides to relocate to another community 'one idea we are looking at is ensuring that the public investment is repaid by the team if they leave before an original commitment is up even if she 's able to get congress to regulate the league st louis mayor francis slay ha zero desire to see another nfl team'such a the for now oakland raiders'take the ram ' place at this point i 'm so frustrated and disappointed with the nfl slay said on wednesday why would anybody want to in any way even entertain any suggestion from the nfl after the way they dealt with st louis here i mean it wa dishonest they were not being truthful with u that 's a sentiment that is echoed by mcafee who remains a ram fan if a somewhat bitter one 'the cake wa already baked he said describing the decision making process and somewhat flexible application of the rule by the nfl 's relocation committee 'the whole play had been scripted it 's just that we did n't know it,43588.0

great hosting regarded a more than the oscar ' drunk corrupt cousin while there are still no black voter actually voting on the awards'which do n't get me wrong is a major problem that need to be addressed'the day of movie like the silly burlesque being awarded multiple noms following a flashy vega trip replete with cher concert for hollywood foreign press voter or the tourist to get johnny and angelina to attend the soiree seem like a distant memory kevin distant memory neverforget burlesque marlow r i p christina aguilera 's movie career ok so let 's start with the movie for best motion picture ' drama my choice ha to be mad max fury road which wa unfairly shunned by the baftas it wa in my humble opinion the most thrilling childlike wonderment inducing movie of the year carol wa absolutely lovely immaculately staged and had arguably the best final scene along with phoenix of but i got ta give it to my girl furiosa the most badass cinema heroine since ellen ripley that being said best actress in a motion picture ' drama should go to the inimitable cate blanchett for her outr turn a a closeted s housewife in todd haynes 's carol blanchett remains one of the few actress in hollywood along with marion cotillard naomi watt jessica chastain and the newly minted rebecca ferguson who exudes classic movie star glamour and here she is an absolute dynamo conveying carol 's inner anguish and torment at the hand of an iniquitous society since my two favorite lead actress performance of the year were snubbed charlize in mad max and nina ho in phoenix cate get the gold kevin i love the golden globe i think it 's hilarious when they do thing like nominate burlesque for best picture and i think it 's an essential corrective to the oscar distaste for genre fare when comedy like bridesmaid ghostbusters home alone and the best movie of all time sister act can be considered best picture nominee a well a more action heavy movie like my pick for best drama this year mad max fury road marlow i enjoy the batshit aspect of it too'along with the bottle of champagne the star are getting sloshed on which make it sort of like the bachelor bachelorette meet a black tie ceremony and do n't forget sister act ii for the lauryn hill factor but yes the oscar ' distaste for all thing comedy continues to be an embarrassment agreed anyways ' kevin sadly i think for the most badass feminist dystopian car chase conservation flick of all time it 's truly just an honor to be nominated i predict that carol will win best drama even though for all it pretty costume and aching romance it 's far too still for my taste and never really convinces me that there 's a good reason for rooney mara 's therese so be so obsessed with this titular basket case let alone why me a a viewer should care about her solid review for the film and for blanchett who i think is out acted by mara will carry both to a win which is a major bummer because brie larson is so much more deserving for her startling star is born turn in room is there even a point talking about best actor in a drama leo get raped by a bear win award right marlow brie is excellent in room though i thought she turned in a superior and criminally overlooked performance in short term a for the bear rape that wa n't yes the hfpa love leo even though he 's gotten shut out at the oscar he 's taken home well deserved globe for the wolf of wall street which ha aged very well and the aviator ditto and will win his third this year plus this category is insane will smith for concussion methinks the hfpa got a bit starstruck here instead of voting for more deserving candidate though this is also the result of film like the big short perhaps the most rage inducing thing this side of making a murderer and the martian being in the comedy category which is even crazier kevin yeah the category placement is always majorly ridiculous here the big short wa le ha ha funny than it wa weep silent tear for humanity funny though i kind of buy the martian in this category the 'matt damon on mar one man show had some good nyuks it 's why the martian will likely take home the best comedy prize instead of the buzzier trainwreck or melissa mccarthy 's gut busting action spoof spy which wa for my money the most entertaining'and should n't that make it the best 'movie of the year my religion is rose byrne 's performance in that film marlow rose byrne is so deliciously good in that she made our best performance of the year list too kevin the more interesting race though is best actress in a comedy which pit bffs and renowned cool kid amy schumer and jennifer lawrence who is nominated for joy against each other whoo ee wa joy a stinker of a movie but lawrence commanded the screen and wa feisty and did her lawrence thang which is why i think she stand a pretty good shot of taking the trophy from the far more deserving schumer and the supes adorbz lily tomlin who is so so good in grandma my sneaking suspicion though is that the hfpa wo n't be able to resist the fawning headline that would accompany what would surely be a sensational speech should schumer win buckle down for some unbridled k fal enthusiasm if she doe marlow joy wa prettyyyy prettyyyy bad and i 'm a big david o russell fan'even enjoyed the batshit i heart huckabees albeit mostly for naomi watt and marky mark 's gung ho turn out of all the nominee here i think schumer is the most deserving for trainwreck and i 'm hoping she 'll eke out a surprise win she managed the dramatic moment just a well a the comedic one and that eulogy sequence alone is a more impressive acting feat than anything i saw in joy despite like you said the magnetism of j law either way i 'm sure there 'll be some great gifable moment of the two posing with the globe and in n out burger although maybe that 's just me projecting kevin if nbc doe n't have camera operator entirely dedicated to documenting j law and amy then i do n't know what 's real anymore marlow for the best motion picture ' comedy and best actor comedy i think we 've got a martian twofer for film and matt damon despite his unfortunate white privilege moment on hbo 's project greenlight damon 's been one of the most consistently good actor and dude in hollywood over the past two decade and his performance age surprisingly well'especially his demented one in the talented mr ripley which deserved all the award so to quote team america world police i think matt daaaaaaayyymin will have a very big night kevin that is a very apt team america quote and here is a very apt kevin fallon quote 'if sylvester stallone doe n't win a golden globe for creed i 'm sending flaming bag of dog poo to every member of the hollywood foreign press and for best supporting actress i 'd say alicia vikander take it for ex machina my heart is with kate winslet and jennifer jason leigh my soul is with the year 's biggest breakout star the swede who wa in every goddamn movie the spritely ing nue who nearly made the danish girl watchable this is her reward marlow kristen stewart deserves the best supporting actress globe for her emotionally raw and nervy performance in cloud of sils maria but ala she wa looked over by the hfpa'this despite becoming the first american since adrien brody for the pianist to win a c sar france 's equivalent of an oscar but yes vikander would be my second choice and definitely deserves it even though the best performance in the film belongs to oscar isaac who make an excellent silicon valley egomaniac killer dance move and all sly is fine and i still think the story about how he got richard gere fired off of lord of flatbush is one of the funniest thing i 've ever heard it involves a messy sandwich you must read it here but my choice for best supporting actor go to paul dano for his tremendous turn a the beach boy ' brian wilson in love mercy he pulled off a tremendous feat bringing the creative process to mad thrilling life kevin but also let 's talk about tv i love tv i love the golden globe ' batshit taste in tv are this year 's nominee the best television series and actor from this past year oh good lord not at all but they are fun and buzzy and driving conversation and interesting and adventurous the globe like to reward the tv show that everyone is talking about and this year everyone is talking about that fella mr robot i expect a sweep best drama best supporting actor for christian slater and best actor for ramus malek sorry jon hamm marlow all i can really process right now is making a murderer but i 'll do my best here to free up some brain space a much a i love the idea of a mr robot clean sweep i think hamm will take the globe here a a well deserved statue for his entire run on mad men'though my personal choice would be malek for sure and a best supporting trophy for slater will make up for the fact that he should have been nominated a best supporting actor for heather i stand by this a for actress in a drama it 's going to viola davis she 's got the award show trifecta of powerhouse actress great speech giver and can seriously rock a dress those arm ' best in the biz though my choice would actually be taraji p henson for empire who absolutely slays a cookie one of the most fun character on tv kevin in my dream viola davis and taraji p henson tie and weep into each other 's arm a i sob into my white wine at the beauty of it all but i also think davis will win sorry taraji a for the comedy race who the hell freaking know have you seen that list casual mozart in the jungle orange is the new black transparent veep and silicon valley transparent which won last year is deserving of a repeat for it soulful and rich second season but do n't be surprised if these clown do something really weird like name mozart in the jungle it winner marlow i did n't even know what mozart in the jungle wa about until a few month ago to be honest it sound like a series about ayahuasca ceremony or something kevin honestly i 'd rather watch a show about that anyway the comedy acting race are always tough to predict last year gina rodriguez stole my heart with her jane the virgin speech and could feasibly repeat this year though i think the cw 's new it girl rachel bloom could steal it for crazy ex girlfriend similarly i 'd be gassed for jeffrey tambor to take it again but i ca n't imagine the globe resisting the urge to give aziz ansari the chance to deliver a quirky charming awkward cool speech for the quirky charming awkward cool master of none marlow aziz would love that deep down i 'm hoping that empire win for best drama and then sean penn pull a kanye and stage crash lee daniel ' acceptance speech'only to have taraji come in with the left field haymaker knocking him out cold a boy can dream,18160.0

okcupid which is owned by iac the daily beast 's parent company found that it gay male user had enjoyed roughly the same number of sexual partner a everyone else if just one percent of heterosexual male self reported that they 'd engaged in intercourse with or more partner in their lifetime the share of gay wa just a hair higher'at two percent that 's hardly enough to be statistically significant a later study actually found that gay men reported having fewer partner than their straight counterpart whereas the average heterosexual male claimed to have had sex with five partner gay had just four but despite these statistic myth about the scourge of promiscuous gay men keep going strong'unfettered by a thing like reality last week i wrote a piece about the high rate of open marriage in the gay community and rather than coming to term with the fact that same sex and heterosexual relationship might their own separate boundary and expectation many reader saw it a a confirmation of the oldest canard to ever canard gay just can not keep it in their pant the comment are n't worth repeating'because if you 're a queer man you 've likely heard them all your life these idea have long been at the center of conservative opposition to marriage equality if gay men ca n't behave themselves why should they have the same right a everyone else troy mader'a republican representative for wyoming 's house of representatives'once even suggested that promiscuity wa a leading cause of gay suicide while it 's important to assert that these right wing notion what it mean to be queer are pernicious and harmful we should n't run from the question of sex itself some folk do engage in many type of sexual activity with many different people when we pretend that gay promiscuity doe n't exist we continue to weaponize sex for a community that for too long ha read that three letter word a a death sentence in dossie easton and catherine a liszt published the ethical slut'which ha in the two decade since become the seminal polyamory bible but the greater message of easton and liszt 's book is to destigmatize mutually consenting healthy play between 'good giving

wondrously explorative ' s i learned that gay men use the word 'slut ' a a term of admiration and approval a in 'what did you do at that party oh you slut ' but gay men have their own complicated relationship with promiscuity and slut shaming'one borne out of the aid panic of the s a peter conrad writes in the sociology of health and illness population disproportionately at risk for illness have always been subjected to stigma'from cholera to the bubonic plague however because hiv is spread through sexual contact the target is a much behavior a it is homosexuality particularly within the

frustrating paradox but it 's hardly a mystery why that would be the case the lingering shame around gay sexuality'including a lack of education around healthy sex'keeps many from seeking these crucial resource or even wearing a condom in an earlier study from the cdc found that lgb teenager were more likely than their heterosexual peer to be partaking in risky unprotected sex the organization argued that these phenomenon are due to a dearth of 'safe supportive environment for queer youth'who might not have affirming community or parent willing to have the sex talk with them they 're often forced to figure it out on their own that lack of sex positivity'or education geared specifically toward queer bodies'will continue to be a problem when young people leave the home and attempt to find themselves in a community that struggle with acknowledging the reality of sex last august noah michelson executive editor of gay voice wrote a piece about the simple fact that he 's a queer man who love sex an acknowledgment that should n't be all that controversial but the response from other gay wa often quite negative ' p eople are saying that i 'm a pervert and that i 'm ruining it for all of u he said in an interview with the site 'and it 's immature to act that way and that 's how a teenager would act his article acknowledged what we rarely recognize sure gay are having about a much intercourse a everyone else but how we form community around sex is quite different public sex spaces'including underground bar and porn theaters'are deeply ingrained into the history of the community an important meeting ground for men to explore themselves and others body today those space are disappearing across the country replaced by the privacy of technology survey show that percent of queer men meet their partner on hookup apps like grindr and scruff but that doe n't mean our need for sexual liberation ha decreased if stigma is continuing to kill people at high rate it 's arguably more important than ever if gay have long been taught that our desire are predatory or the reason we ca n't have nice thing it 's natural that we would have internalized a great deal of what freud termed schwanzangst'our own fear of penis but the simplest way to eradicate that very angst is to embrace the promiscuity we 've been running from for so long a long a you 're being

member of the royal family and that there would be a short wreath laying ceremony afterwards to mark the centenary of the ill fated first world war gallipoli campaign they were expecting the cambridge maybe a prince andrew just about enough to make an early sunday morning start worthwhile so imagine the surprise of the assembled hack when up the frosty laneway that connects sandringham house to st mary 's church who should come striding confidently into view behind william and kate but the entire middleton clan the queen arrived by car looking pleased a punch and smiling broadly for the now frenziedly snapping camera carole and pippa led the way followed by pippa 's brother james and her father michael the immediate conclusion wa that the middleton must have been staying at anmer hall the cambridge 's spectacular ten bedroom country home which is fast becoming william and kate 's full time base while celebrating kate 's th birthday which fell on saturday it is a sign of just how effectively the cambridge have managed to lock down their household that not a royal reporter in the land had a clue that the middleton were due to be spending the weekend with kate and will it wa perhaps slightly odd that they all arrived on foot from the direction of sandringham house rather than in a car from anmer but even odder wa that after the church service a the queen and prince philip spent a few minute laying wreath with william and kate the remaining middleton trotted off back in the direction of sandringham where according to source they were guest at a typical sandringham sunday lunch they cut quite a sight james bearded hand in pocket in a skinny pale blue hipster suit from savile row tucked over chelsea boot pippa freshly tanned from a recent holiday in st bart wore thick black woolly tights and a short dress with an extravagant russian style fur hat perched on her head while kate 's mum carole cut a dash in the kind of glamorous long winter coat that her daughter wear so effectively if there wa any doubt that the middleton have been completely embraced by the queen this wa it make no mistake being invited to attend an informal sandringham church service with her majesty is no meager endorsement say one source 'given the queen 's emphasis on duty and religion this wa arguably an even more important moment of acceptance for the middleton clan than being invited to ride in the royal carriage at ascot the queen 's casual invitation to the middleton to join the royal for lunch may also have been intended to make up for the fact that they were excluded from christmas lunch at sandringham although william kate and their child did in fact have their turkey at the big house despite extensive speculation that they were planning a more informal family affair at their own home the queen is undoubtedly making a clear point that she belief the middleton worthy of respect and full inclusion in the royal circle of trust the queen is said to have increasing regard for carole in particular coming to admire the woman who ha fought her way to the top of business with a resolutely middle class attitude she may once have been mocked by her son in law and daughter 's society friend for having been a flight attendant but carole is now having the last laugh having secured for herself an inviolable place at the heart of the new royal establishment intriguingly prince charles ha been le welcoming of the middleton always accused of being somewhat prone to snobbish tendency he is not believed to have invited the family to his private house at highgrove it doe n't particularly bother kate or william however and even le the middleton themselves 'they always were a fairly thick skinned bunch and that tendency ha only become more pronounced since kate and william married say a family friend the monarch once again is leading by example for although the middleton clan might divide opinion'some still think it is inappropriate for the future queen 's mother to be running a website selling party gear and writing article for magazine about home entertaining'there is no doubt that the strategy of embracing the middleton ha made kate 's transition to royal life easier inevitably the middleton will be called on to play a larger and larger role in public life over the next few decade and by inviting them to attend church alongside her and join her for lunch afterwards the queen is shrewdly making sure she ha loyalty a well a letting them know they can be confident of their membership in the club whatever reaction they get from prince charles and some more sniffy member of the establishment,87038.0

testify against what appears to be the show 's next villain on the horizon'a man who seemed to have cast a spell on mr baxter and other woman a he parlayed his own life of crime'the gentleman is a devil mr baxter said though of what shape and devilry we know not yet the stout and even more goodly mr molesley quoted edmund burke at mr baxter to encourage her to open her bouche to the authority 'all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing my favorite line wa mr bates who to her husband noted of the police visit that it made 'a nice change it wa n't for one of them'it ha now been nearly a month since one wa n't charged wrongfully with murder a downton record branson wa banging on about his big take home from america where 'the hard working man can go right to the top and how stuffy and unmeritocratic britain wa in comparison'but not for long it wa posited downton sure is packed with spookily accurate crystal ball while branson 's newly neutered class consciousness wa a if the very lefty jeremy corbyn had banged his head and woken up spouting the merit of thatcher era class mobility another sudden if temporary rise downstairs barrow wa relishing being mr carson while the latter wa on his honeymoon ordering the staff about and enjoying them standing for him when he entered the room he did n't want molesley or baxter 's pity two who can see through his vicious facade this episode of class conflict wa exacerbated by daisy 's grating griping on behalf of mr mason who she want to take over the lease of that farm on the ground daisy wa convinced lady grantham had betrayed her 'you could n't be harder on those potato if you had accused them of spying mr patmore the cook noted and of course the endless who should run the hospital saga

isabel and violet over the hospital sensible move and whether it should remain local and self operating or become part of the bigger health authority can i bear to sketch this plot knot endlessly i can not next week i will say it is about owl lady mary thought it odd talbot wa a race car driver but then people did such odd job she said she had met a man who imported guinea pig from peru lord

remember'sybil had helped to become a secretary came back to downton the wife of john harding 'a self made man this theme of escaping one 's past and shaping one 's future and destiny wa crystallized by her arrival the servant knew her of course but now she wa an 'upstairs ' guest'they predicted correctly no one would recognize her because they do n't look at servant in the face that wa piercing even if downton is full of such intrigue everyone 's always looking sat each other 's face branson recognized her of course and her belief in bettering herself and upsetting the order in the best way is shared by him gwen spoke passionately and to the support of the downton sisterhood about the need to educate woman until barrow on maximum evil informed everyone she had been a housemaid lady mary bridled why plot convenience maybe'it made no sense while everyone else applauded her for her advancement in life lady edith said the aristos had been in the wrong for never addressing her properly while wa there bates castigated barrow and told him he wa jealous which is why he had set out to humiliate gwen gwen told the crawleys of the now dead sybil 's kindness and in yet another class crossing visit downstairs daisy again pleaded for mr mason with branson lord crawley told barrow he did n't care for his 'lack of generosity later he told barrow people were loyal to carson because he wa kind'and to think about that a his own hour to leave downton approacheth barrow wa n't being a total asshole he wondered to baxter what he wa doing any more baxter said they were all trying to get through life a best they could he told her she wa stronger than she thought and that he wa n't impervious to everyone 's disapproval he cared what people said about him baxter feel 'ruined because of her thievery molesley tried to tell her the experience had made her stronger 'you are your own worst enemy baxter told barrow 'if i am i 've got competition barrow retorted quite rightly it really wa

about the invasiveness of the state until 'individuals ' wish are nothing the magna carta protected great family she added violet 's eruption of garbled sound at people disagreeing with her wa an all too audible signal of her distress at change and thing not going her way given even a slither of happiness for her must always be imperiled mr bates got an ache 'down there ' leading to a convoluted trip to london to the harley street doctor to check if she wa miscarrying the baby she thought she could n't carry anyway but she is and had n't yet told mr bates about she wa n't miscarrying and when mr bates realized she wa up the duff they were happy and hugged they were happy we left mr and mr bates happy in an episode of downton abbey how long can this last how long can we stand it gwen 's visit set off a bout of everyone thinking what their life had become and been about even lady mary in the end branson and cora decided mr mason could have the farm even though it made no financial

at all the feminist support it aroused and wondered if this would all end with such madness a a female pope shock lady mary defended edith and said it wa a good idea not a shock when cousin rosalind

starting to smell musty feel hackneyed last year 's sotu drew the worst rating in year still the audience wa million that 's more than watched that crazy steelers bengal game saturday night if you 're outdrawing the nfl'and that 's on a bad year'you 're accomplishing something so i guess for the time being it 's here to stay it doe n't often live up to the hype personally i 'm not expecting a lot tonight only because barack obama and the republican are in their last year of slogging trench warfare and there 's no convulsive scandal gripping the capital but maybe we 'll be surprised in the meantime here are five time that the sotu wa dramatic abraham lincoln for starter there wa a war going on and not in europe or indochina but a few mile from the capitol building that 's pretty big drama right there but it wa in this speech that lincoln first directly tied the preservation of the union to the end of slavery money quote 'we say we are for the union the world will not forget that we say this we know how to save the union the world know we do know how to save it we even we here hold the power and bear the responsibility in giving freedom to the slave we assure freedom to the free'honorable alike in what we give and what we preserve we shall nobly save or meanly lose the last best hope of earth nielsen and cable were n't around but the address wa delivered on december and the emancipation proclamation three week later we can be sure there wa much discussion of executive overreach on january the space shuttle challenger exploded ronald reagan wa set to give his state of the union address that night but it became the only sotu ever delayed by a week i you were n't around then you ca n't quite imagine the impact of that event on the america of the time it wa n't the first space program tragedy that wa caught on tv'that wa the apollo mishap but it wa the first in which american saw the thing go ka boom in real time reagan 's speech that night wa arguably his most memorable and a week later he opened the sotu with a moving tribute to the dead astronaut reagan is a comparative font of sotu trivia'he wa also the first president to start this annoying thing of inviting guest to the first lady 's box in worst george w bush the 'axis of evil speech wa a sotu in 'the first sotu since when the state of the union wa anything but strong it wa freaked out and thirsting for blood of some kind it wa already obvious to me and some other people that he and his people wanted to go to war in iraq but they were keeping that under wrap for the time being but he released the poison into the atmosphere here of north korea iran and iraq bush said 'states like these and their terrorist ally constitute an axis of evil arming to threaten the peace of the world by seeking weapon of mass destruction these regime pose a grave and growing danger they could provide these arm to terrorist giving them the mean to match their hatred they could attack our ally or attempt to blackmail the united state in any of these case the price of indifference would be catastrophic maybe with respect to iran and north korea we 'll find out one way or the other someday with respect to iraq the price of non indifference is one we 're still paying year later a might befit the most consequential president of the th century franklin roosevelt gave two that really mattered at least to people on my side of the fence in he enunciated the four freedom of speech of worship from want from fear the first two were unobjectionable the third wa and still is considered by those on the right to be marxism american style and the fourth wa aimed at the right wing isolationist crowd and was'and is'denounced a surrendering u s hegemony then in roosevelt proposed his 'second bill of right this wa the third freedom on steroid we 're not there yet but give u eight year of hillary and we 'll see obviously in term of modern drama bill clinton in is the cake taker it wa five day after the lewinsky scandal broke and it wa a time when tv journalist were saying thing like well like sam donaldson very prominent at the time saying 'his presidency could be numbered in day if you are young and do n't know much about all this well do n't worry something tell me you will know plenty by this november the short version is that special prosecutor ken starr had been after clinton for year and had come up empty for year finally in mid january he got a tip that clinton had had a relationship with a low level white house aide contrary to the normal journalistic shorthand which is wrong'shocker i know'monica wa not by then an intern and within day it wa leaked probably illegally to the press '' it being not just word of the affair but the false suggestion that clinton and his friend vernon jordan had suborned perjury by asking lewinsky to lie under oath which they had not done but on the day of the sotu all of washington believed he had and in that insane hyperventilating atmosphere he walk into the house chamber and say not a single word about the whole thing give an hour plus speech about the economy child 's health insurance the middle east what a set on that guy but he wa right it 's the only time the president get higher rating than an nfl game do n't respond to critic say what you want million american to think obama should take heed ignore the hater and

nyco renaissance nyco r headed by hedge fund manager roy niederhoffer and michael capasso former head of the now defunct dicapo opera theatre opened their first production a six show run of giacomo puccini 's tosca at the rose theatre at jazz at lincoln center with the full legal authority to use the nyco name whether it stay alive however is another story nyco 's untimely and very public death left the metropolitan opera the only major opera company in new york city most large european city have more than one major opera company london and paris have two each berlin and vienna each have three and that is not counting the myriad of smaller company that perform in each of those city the closure of nyco and the general madness surrounding the metropolitan opera in the last couple year have caused some to doubt the future of opera a an art form in the u the attempted resurrection of nyco ha been watched closely by u opera fan anxiously hoping for a positive sign regarding the future of opera but nyco 's resurrection raise more question than it answer about the course opera company and production in the u may take in the future the bizarre and convoluted battle to resurrect nyco after it declared bankruptcy in late ha been covered here and here but much ha happened in the six month leading up to last wednesday 's opening night in line with the operatic nature of the proceeding since nyco 's bankruptcy everything came down right to the wire it wa n't until january th le than eight day before the opening that judge sean lane of the u bankruptcy court in manhattan greenlit nyco r 's plan for resurrecting nyco and gave them legal authority to use the nyco name and remaining asset these included an approximately million endowment and a bequest to the original nyco in the will of a wealthy benefactor estimated at million in early december niederhoffer and capasso 's main opponent in the battle for control of the remains of nyco architect gene kaufman dropped out of the hunt and appeared to pave a clear road for nyco r to take possession of nyco 's name and asset but even this positive turn of event for nyco r wa not without drama on january one month after kaufman 's team dropped out and just under two week before nyco r 's opening night the ny district attorney 's office issued a court filing questioning the long term financial viability of nyco r 's plan a separate filing by the da 's office questioned the planned payment by nyco r to kaufman 's new vision for nyc opera for 'administrative expense and attorney ' fee because of how much such a payment 'would deplete the already limited asset available to city opera that did not deter niederhoffer and crew after revising their plan to in part allow mr niederhoffer 's foundation instead of nyco r to make the payment to kaufman directly they pushed forward and on january th judge lane officially confirmed nyco r 's reorganization plan financial responsibility and longevity ha been a long standing concern for the nyco r project raised not just by the da 's filing but by those in the opera community who feel capasso ran his last company the seat dicapo opera theatre on the upper east side into the ground in an ap article widely circulated the day before nyco r 's opening night last week capasso is quoted a saying of his nyco r plan 'my five year plan will reinvigorate the repertory bring it back to the glory day it 's a model in term of how to program a season that will have widest possible appeal many found this an oddly confident statement coming from a man who wa sued by the musician 's union local of the american federation of musician for unpaid wage in and who closed dicapo in still owing many people money over a year before the nyco r proposal originated additionally capasso 's bombast and hubris could be perceived a everything that the general public think is wrong with and off putting about opera in general lofty distant elitist sounding platitude that are ultimately empty and without relevance to the today 's audience not exactly the way to attract new audience the original nyco stood a an alternative to the more traditional metropolitan opera often programming new american work that had not and perhaps would not be seen elsewhere today many new work are produced by the smaller company that have popped up since the original nyco 's departure from lincoln center so what is the position of a new nyco in nyc doe nyc need or even want a new major opera company what doe a 'people 's opera a mayor fiorello la guardia called the original nyco even mean now these question were drawn into even sharper focus a nyco r 's tosca came just over a week after the ending of nyc 's th annual prototype festival co produced by beth morrison project and here which specializes in presenting smaller more experimental opera and theatre work at venue across the city the centerpiece of this year 's festival wa the nyc premiere of composer david t little 's searing post apocalyptic opera dog day beth morrison project and prototype have become the engine for the cutting edge of new operatic work in nyc so where doe a new nyco fit in additionally venture opera on site opera and the highly acclaimed loft opera all in nyc are far smaller faster lighter on their foot than traditional opera company and therefore able to be far more intimate reactive immersive and site specific is there a middle ground between them and the grandeur and spectacle of the mighty metropolitan opera that even need to be filled the new york critic have been lukewarm on both the first production and the overall position of nyco r anthony tommasini of the new york time praised some of the singing but added 'the musical performance'was prone to mishap with some flash of intensity but many inert stretch on the night i attended the nyco r tosca i found an attractive younger finance crowd that i do not see at the met in such number some of these young people will eventually be poised to become the next generation of mega art donor that is great both for nyco r and opera in general however will they return in the future especially given the frustration and chaos the facility at the rose theatre at jazz at lincoln center caused wa it nyco r or the rose 's fault that people spent the vast majority of the two intermission on line for the single working men 's room or on line at the single bar with only two working cashier many people did not even get the drink they waited minute on line for a intermission ended before they could several people missed the second act because they were waiting for the bathroom and there were no late admission to the theatre after either intermission i can only imagine this happened to some for the third act and they just left finally and most egregiously the light were dropped and the second act began when there were still many people in the aisle waiting to take their seat not having had time after the endless line and waiting of the intermission whatever the reason it must be remedied no one will return to a company that force patron to claw their way through a crowded aisle in the dark to find their seat let alone donate to one nyco r promised an announcement of their second show soon with capasso pledging to announce three more in the next few month and a total of six for nyco r 's season for more information on nyco renaissance please visit nycorenaissance com,4054.0

academy award nomination were announced on january th for the second straight year all twenty acting nominee were white the criticism wa fast and furious with cineastes and pundit reviving last year 's oscarssowhite hashtag a they lambasted hollywood 's most famous award show for it lack of diversity a well a the industry a a whole thing took an even more interesting turn after jada pinkett smith voiced her opinion that black actor should reject the academy a much a it ha rejected black actor over the last two year 'is it time that people of color recognize how much power influence that we have amassed that we no longer need to ask to be invited anywhere she said in a video message shared on mlk day 'begging for acknowledgement or even asking diminishes dignity and diminishes power and we are a dignified people and we are powerful 'so let 's let the academy do them with all grace and love and let 's do u differently pinkett smith 's word along with pointed criticism from filmmaker spike lee 'forty white actor in two year and no flava at all we ca n't act wtf lee wrote on instagram sparked a movement to boycott the award show though neither pinkett smith nor lee explicitly called for a boycott the trickle of criticism turned into a flood of antipathy a everyone from george clooney to tyrese gibson took the academy to task for ignoring non white actor for two consecutive year 'if you think back year ago the academy wa doing a better job clooney said to variety 'think about how many more african american were nominated i think around certainly there were black nominees'like don cheadles morgan freeman and all of a sudden you feel like we 're moving in the wrong direction there were nomination left off the table there were four film this year creed could have gotten nomination concussion could have gotten will smith idris elba could have been nominated for beast of no nation and straight outta compton could have been nominated tyrese'as well a rapper actor cent'went a far a calling for comedian chris rock to step down a oscar ' host 'there is no joke that he can crack there is no way for him to seize the moment and come into this thing and say 'i 'm going to say this and say that i 'm going to address the issue but then i 'm still going to keep my gig a the host ' tyrese told people 'the statement that you make is that you step down rock stepping down would carry a powerfully symbolic message but doe n't seem likely it is n't all that fair either unlike attendee rock is contractually obligated to appear at the show many of rock 's fellow comedian have supported him going forward with hosting the show 'if i were chris rock i would n't be considering boycotting the oscar shared gervais 'i 'd be thinking 'this shit is live i can do some serious damage ' gervais 's unsolicited advice sound full of devilish possibility but we should n't assume that a black comic will be given a much freedom to dig his heel into the academy 's neck rock attacking the oscar on their own stage would be undeniably ballsy but could he get away with this kind of gervaisian award show anarchy without sparking a serious backlash who know but we should n't put the onus on rock the idea of boycotting the oscar is an attractive show of solidarity but it is just the tip of the proverbial iceberg a it pertains to racial bias in hollywood non white actor and filmmaker continually face further marginalization and fewer opportunity and if anything the oscar backlash is proof that fan and contributor are remaining vigilant in their scrutiny of hollywood two year after steve mcqueen and lupita nyong'o no one should want to see hollywood 's racial clock turned back but the idea of a boycott ha also drawn tremendous criticism 'i make movie for a living let me tell you what the problem is it 's not that the people doing the nominating are too white the view co host'and oscar winner'whoopi goldberg said in response to pinkett smith 's video 'the problem is the people who can be helping to make movie that have black and latino and woman and all that'that money doe n't come to you because the idea is that there is no place for black movie 'chris rock is the host of the academy award and so to boycott him seems just a bad a what everybody is saying she said 'we have this conversation every year and it piss me off in goldberg wa the first black star to host the oscar without a co host sammy davis jr and richard pryor had hosted previously with other star 'boycotting doe n't work and it 's also a slap in the face to chris rock added goldberg black platform have made huge inroad in term of getting more black content onscreen and black award show do a great job of celebrating that content but if white hollywood hears anything amidst the voice calling out industry bias they should hear that non white actor director and project have to be a priority for a community that seems fairly out of touch with the current cultural climate television ha launched several successful show with black lead and many of those show have netted award for them if tv can find vehicle for taraji p henson morris chestnut viola davis aziz ansari kerry washington ken jeong regina king and jennifer lopez then why are the most high profile film project still so lily white whether one support the idea of a boycott there is no doubt that change ha to happen in hollywood a pinkett smith suggested black people and other non white people will continue to 'do u and leave the academy to 'do them that doe n't have to be called a 'boycott to

will be made to understand how desperately it need the story and the creativity of brown folk and in an era when black life matter is the most important political issue of our time this is about more than just movie mark ruffalo tweeted his support for the boycott on the ground that the academy 's bias are indicative of deeper social ill 'i do support the oscar ban movement 's position that the nomination do not reflect the diversity of our community ruffalo tweeted 'the oscar ban movement reflects a larger discussion about racism in the criminal justice system will smith echoed ruffalo 's concern in an interview with good morning america 'when i see this list and series of nomination that come out'and everybody is fantastic and that 's the complexity of this issue everyone is beautiful and deserving and it 's fantastic'but it feel like it 's going the wrong direction smith said 'the nomination reflect the academy the academy reflects the industry hollywood and then the industry reflects america there is a regressive slide towards separatism towards racial and religious disharmony and that 's not the hollywood that i want to leave behind that 's not the industry that 's not the america i want to leave behind he added smith also acknowledged that him not getting a nomination for concussion 'probably wa part of what inspired his wife jada to voice her criticism but it wa n't the sole motivator 'there 's probably a part of that in there but for jada had i been nominated and no other people of color were she would have made the video anyway smith said 'we 'd still be here having this conversation this is so deeply not about me this is about child that are going to sit down and they 're going to watch this show and they 're not going to see themselves represented and it 's about an industry that seems all too eager to take those child 's money at the box office hollywood doe n't have to do anything it doe n't want to do nor doe the academy actor are tired of being ignored and they 're making that clear but what will happen when the people decide that they 're tired of being ignored too,37321.0

all the love for a little seen amazon series called mozart in the jungle not only did the show score a best comedy series nod but it star gael garc a bernal also landed himself in the best actor in a television comedy series category alongside aziz ansari rob lowe and jeffrey tambor unlike those three men the mexican born star of film y tu mam tambi n the motorcycle diary and more recently the jon stewart directed drama rosewater is not exactly known for his comedy chop but for fan of mozart which just started streaming it second season on amazon december the accolade were le shocking a rodrigo the eccentric maestro of the incestuous new york symphony he ha developed a completely unique performance and can get laugh with nothing more than the way he mispronounces the name of co star lola kirke 's character it 's hailey but coming from rodrigo it sound more like the sport jai alai on march bernal return to the big screen with yet another dark turn in the immigration thriller desierto the directorial debut of jon s cuar n who previously co wrote the script for gravity with his father alfonso cuar n desierto turn the contentious immigration debate into a tense action film set along the u s mexico border while bernal play one of a group of migrant trying to enter the united state jeffrey dean morgan portrays a racist vigilante who decides to take matter into his own hand to prevent them from doing so bernal spoke to the daily beast about both project and shared his message for latino who do n't want to see president donald trump build a wall along the southern border below is an edited and condensed version of our conversation congrats on the golden globe nomination for mozart in the jungle the show seems to have flown under the radar for a while but people are finally starting to really take notice just in time for season two thank you so much yeah that 's great man i 'm really happy really delighted i 'm just spinning can you talk a little bit about what drew you to the part of rodrigo it wa a combination of many thing but the fact that it wa a show about classical music really pulled my attention because that itself is very original to do a tv series about that so that pulled me immediately but the way it wa put together the people that were involved'roman coppola jason schwartzman and paul weitz 'it wa something that wa very interesting to be part of and now i 'm just delighted because i look forward each year to working on it to learn more because i learn so much doing each episode and to spend time in new york working with this wonderful group of people it 's incredible and to play rodrigo he 's one of the most fun character to play you know he 's so free have you enjoyed the opportunity to play comedy after doing a lot of darker work throughout your career i think yeah that wa something i wa looking for a well because it wa nice to do something relaxed and a little bit more approachable and at the same time it take another type of effort that leaf you really tired you have to be really connected and really playing the part all of the time comedy requires a lot of energy shifting gear the trailer for desierto just premiered it tell the story of a group of migrant trying to cross the u s mexico border but it appears to be a thriller or even a horror film what can you tell u about your character in the film yeah it 's this migrant story with everyone crossing the border for different reason most of them forced reason and they encounter this character who unfortunately take matter into his own hand and kind of validates a hate discourse'just suddenly snap and start killing these people the character i play is one of these migrant and it 's pure action the film so a lot of people will find a lot of complexity in it very strong action sequence and hopefully a lot of people will enjoy the film why do you think this story is an important one to tell because it 's an important issue all over the world and it 's an issue that need to be talked about because there is a huge void in leaving a large group of people to be considered criminal and even 'illegal while the world economy need this migration to exist migration is a natural a breathing a eating a sleeping it is part of life part of nature so we have to find a way of establishing a proper kind of scenario for modern migration to exist and when i say 'we i mean the world we need to find way of making that migration not forced because unfortunately in a lot of situation right now with syria for example a lot of the migration that exists is a forced migration between rosewater and now desierto much of your work seems aimed at making a political point what do you make of the recent debate over immigration whether it is idea to deport million of undocumented immigrant or call to keep syrian refugee out of the country sigh i think that 's the wrong way to tackle this subject because first of all it 's an issue that involves everybody and there are many leg to it and with immigration again we are denying a natural phenomenon we ca n't deny that natural phenomenon we need to establish root of how to make that phenomenon happen in a way that is yes legal but we also need to prevent this forced migration from existing what happened in syria is terrible we all have to be responsible for that million of people are left without a home and without a future we ca n't let those kid not have a future and in the case of the united state and mexico or latin america there is an interdependent culture and economy we 've seen through history that building wall is completely obsolete and completely ridiculous the best investment you can make is to prevent forced migration and to take down wall so we share this interdependence in harmony and not in this kind of contention of course the man who 's leading the republican presidential primary race right now is donald trump who want to build a wall between the u s and mexico how do you think latino voter will respond if he becomes the republican nominee for president well i would suspect that anyone with a human heart will vote against people who talk that way there are a few people in the presidential race who think like that and the problem is that if we do a little bit of insight into history how many time have there been people doing hate discourse blaming everything on a certain group of people so that really is the genesis of genocide where it kind of spark so this hatred should be stopped and the best way to stop it is coming out to vote,17842.0

coverage attention and outrage are the fuel of trumpism and attempt to explain his rise wound up re inscribing the central falsehood of his campaign that people are angry about an america in decline and a government with suspect motif and marginal competence but what if none of that were true what if people are n't really angry america is n't actually in decline and our government is neither malicious nor incompetent are people angry american a whole say they are and i 've been through enough counseling that i hesitate to tell anyone how they feel but trump supporter are n't angry they 're terrified there are form of righteous anger'the kind of communal eruption that happens when there are no other legitimate form of expression trump supporter on the other hand do no lack for legitimate form of expression people are asking them what they think and feel all the time there is not a second of time in the last year that the world ha had to guess at what american white people want numerous progressive commentator and saturday night live have pointed out that the nostalgia inherent in making america great 'again is little more than a pull toward a time before a gaymarriageblackpresidentscarymuslims a one analyst put it 'fear is the path to the dark side fear lead to anger anger lead to hate hate lead to suffering is america in decline no longer 'great i 'm tempted to indulge in a poetic interpretation to delve into the area of american culture and society that produced greatness on a regular basis'from rescue worker to scientist artist to educator but trump and his supporter are at once thuddingly literal and immeasurably ambiguous 'greatness seems to be a combination of economic success and world leader dick measuring but if the u s ha fallen so far in world esteem how come the immigrant that so upset trumpkins want to come here le concretely there are actual data about how the rest of the world view america and it 's largely positive'we have an overall percent approval rating with some country giving u the kind of mark that are a distant memory for america 's political class percent positive opinion in france france percent in both el salvador and kenya economically well by the measure of the white working class non college educated trump supporter they are either extremely late to the realization that their wage have stagnated indeed in real term the average hourly wage peaked in or'and we 're happening on a theme here'the complaint is n't about the loss of 'greatness so much a the emergence of a perceived threat to the status quo i do n't think it 's even about america being le great for them it 's an alarm over the possibility that america is becoming great for people who are n't them whether american greatness is in fact becoming more widely accessible is a separate but related question'and it brings u to the final falsity of the trumpian theology government is both evil and inept there 's no doubt that it can be it 's mostly been evil and inept in the way it 's treated the very people trumpkins worry about sharing the greatness pie with those community continue to suffer but here is where the trump theology find purchase in our democracy'the functioning one outside the circus of the party primaries'did a lot right by it citizen some old wrong began to be righted the death penalty is increasingly unpopular not just in the public eye but with state legislature and judge court in texas texas issued two two death penalty sentence in all of 'the fewest since re instating the penalty year ago across the country death sentence dropped percent from with people being sentenced to death this year by comparison in people were put on death row also in just six state carried out execution the fewest since 'when people were killed and while officer involved shooting continue to be flashpoint for community unrest city have grabbed on to the department of justice 's best practices'hard won lesson from ferguson missouri being put to use in place such a my adopted hometown of minneapolis where the biggest headline of the year might be the riot that did n't happen in the wake of the death of jamal clark also this year politician embraced the end of the war on the drug and the beginning of the movement to aid those in addiction a turn of event that may be the only lasting memory of chris christie 's presidential campaign police department are experimenting with a policy that put treatment before arrest in glouchester massachusetts addict who ask police for treatment will be assisted into a program'on the spot more than have found help so far at the federal level almost unnoticed this month congress ended the federal enforcement of drug law where the state ha legalized medical marijuana somewhere between old wrong being righted and new path forward the fight to raise the minimum wage continues to catch on among activist and ally in government in worker won higher

but legal scam in america cracking down on and getting huge payouts for consumer from payday lender and for profit college how successful is the cfpb it right wing critic have resorted to fearmongering about the importance of payday loan in the fight against terrorism this is n't to say that the year did n't also see tragedy and horror many instance emerging from governmental abuse or ineptitude but it 's important to remember that the fear that trump ha based his campaign on is not real the idea that small d and occasionally big d democratic government work undermines the entire framework of trumpism program like the cfpb and the slow turn toward true criminal justice are kryptonite to the strongman ideology of trump not just because it fuck with his message of government incompetence or maliciousness it successful tenure is evidence of government for the people to be sure but it existence is also evidence of government by the people the image of obama a capricious dictator making social justice decree out of pique is trumpkins ' favorite myth because it cut out the part of our american story that they are the least able to explain or process obama and democrat have facilitated these incremental bit of forward progress because they won they were elected to do so grappling with the fact of a functional government requires more than the admission that protecting citizen is legitimate activity'it also force the argument that government protects and fight for people because that 's what it people want the fearful coverage of the trump 's fear filled campaign ha created an echo of terror on the left of course part alarmist fundraising necessity on the part of democrat part symptom of a conflict obsessed medium many rational and sane american now think that there is a real possibility of donald trump will be elected president i do n't want to encourage complacency by denying the possibility but i do want to remind everyone we 're better than that we 've shown ourselves to be better than that do n't be afraid be aware,12562.0

are n't allowed in his classroom despite a soon to be enacted state law that would welcome them in dr steven weinberg'a near god in the science world for among other thing his contribution in the development of electroweak theory'made known his intention to buck sb commonly known a the campus carry bill during a faculty council meeting on monday where he stood up in opposition of the university working group 's recommendation that classroom not be gun free zone texas ' campus carry law wa passed by a republican legislature last may and go into effect this fall making the state one of nine that allows licensed concealed carrier to bring gun on campus according to a report by the education commission of the state and naspa an association for student affair professional twenty one state expressly ban gun on campus though the carrying of firearm on school ground ha been permitted in texas since the new law extends that right to building on campus it authorizes private university to opt out which they overwhelmingly have public university were permitted to enact 'reasonable rule and regulation for the policy in it report to ut austin president gregory fenves who is expected to issue regulation in mid february the group tasked with recommending these provision conceded 'every member of the working group'including those who are gun owner and license holders'thinks it would be best if gun were not allowed in classroom nevertheless it determined such a ban would violate the law undeterred weinberg stood at the meeting to say 'i will put it into my syllabus that the class is not open to student carrying gun to applause he added that he wa willing 'to expose myself to a lawsuit should one be brought by the state legislature or individual gun owner while admitting he 's no legal scholar the physicist told the daily beast he 's spoken to several in the university 's law school and based on those conversation he think a first amendment claim could win in any challenge from the state legislature or an individual gun owner in federal court 'having gun in the classroom place an undue burden on the right of free speech of professor and student discussing controversial issue he said 'i think we ought to at least try the head of the campus carry task force steven goode reportedly called weinberg 's argument 'extraordinarily weak the gun right group student for concealed carry scc have called the banning of firearm from individual classroom an 'obvious nonstarter along with any rule that would prohibit gun during final exam and during large campus event or require semiautomatic handgun be carried with an unloaded chamber the group ha called on the texas legislature to clarify the 'reasonable rule it will allow university to implement so institution can not circumvent or undermine the law 's original intent the issue weinberg said is n't just about keeping his classroom gun free like the other physic professor weinberg teach one class so the chance that among his or so astrophysics student one would have a concealed handgun permit and would choose to exercise that right in his class is low 'i really do n't expect to be shot he said 'but i do expect that state legislation'if we do n't do anything to protect the classroom environment ' is going to get in the way of our recruiting like every other good university texas is always trying to recruit very good graduate student very good undergraduate student very good junior faculty and a lot of them wo n't come in an atmosphere where there are gun i 've even been getting email from parent who say they do n't want their son or daughter to come to the university of texas if there are gun in the classroom the bigger issue he said is that the state government is trying to dictate detailed policy for university 'that 's what board of regent are for he said 'i think the important thing in this is not the business of how we 're going to keep gun out of our own classroom but that we have rule for the university which allow faculty to decide this issue i 'm all in favor of faculty controlling their own intellectual work and the environment in which they teach for weinberg a classroom where any student could be carrying a gun one where it 's against the law to even ask who might be carrying a concealed weapon is a problem 'it would be something on your mind all the time he said 'i 've taught course on the history of physic that for example describe the interaction between science and religion and i 've seen a few student get angry because they did n't like what i said dr weinberg is a well known and vocal atheist once notably debating the topic of science and religion he said even a 'constructive dialogue between the two camp ''could help to give religion a kind of legitimacy it should n't have once weinberg said that a student angered by the topic of religion got up and walked out of class 'i 'm glad he wa n't carrying a gun weinberg said 'he probably would n't have done anything if he wa but who know antonia okafore southwest regional director for scc told the daily beast that weinberg is simply demonizing concealed handgun license holder an overwhelmingly law abiding group 'what 's to stop an illegal carrier who want to hurt him she said okafore said her group is 'prepared to use any legal mean necessary if it come to it 'so that these arbitrary ban based on what a professor want are n't allowed 'it come down to what the lawmaker say not a bureaucratic administrator weinberg ha said he 's prepared to retire should it come to that and but a of yet he ha only heard from people who support his stand when asked about scc weinberg said he wa n't familiar with the group and they did n't speak for the majority of the university 'i do n't know any faculty member who would sympathize with that he said 'but it 's a big campus and i 'm not surprised there are probably people who want to go back to the gold standard there are all sort of weird

monday morning with hangover of regret it might make sense that the prevailing attitude about the hollywood foreign press association 's annual star studded award ceremony is go home golden globe you 're drunk this is after all the award organization that gave three nomination to the ghastly angelina jolie johnny depp film the tourist'presumably for the opportunity to drool over the statuesque sex gods'and the same year ruled the borderline unwatchable gay man 's fever dream burlesque a contender for best picture it 's the organization that is still haunted by the bribery controversy in which actress pia zadora won the award for new star of the year after her husband reportedly bought voter off that nominated glenn close for best actress for dalmations gave renee zellweger a trophy for her performance in nurse betty and considered jennifer love hewitt award worthy for her work in lifetime 's the client list that hosted the original envelope reading fail long before steve harvey heard of the phillippians or columbia elizabeth taylor 's batty bleating of 'glaaaaaadiator before having read any of the nominee that gave madonna two golden globe including one for acting the golden globe is your friend karen drinking from stranger ' glass after too many mimosa at drunk brunch which is to say that golden globe might be the best of all the award show though kooky puzzling nonsensical infuriating and at least in that case corrupt the golden globe is routinely the most entertaining award show of the year and in term of rewarding film and television the one with the best pulse on current edgy fare although that pulse can be worrisomely erratic it 's easy to laugh for example when the golden globe nominate the short lived kelsey grammer drama bos in a year when it snub breaking bad or to stare quizzically at this year 's best tv comedy list mozart in the jungle and the globe ' film nomination can veer on lunacy drawing the ire of even casual cinephiles but the truth is that the globe have an excellent track record a kingmaker in the tv category singling out series on the crest of becoming buzzworthy that organization like the emmy award routinely ignore and in the world of film the globe can often be the cooler more populist answer to an academy award body that notoriously scoff at genre fare and ha historically favored little seen indie over well made money making movie we 've all seen and loved let 's look at the tv side for starter roseanne arguably one of the greatest family sitcom in tv history won the golden globe for best comedy in the emmy never nominated it in that category not once the x file grey 's anatomy six foot under curb your enthusiasm the u k the office nip tuck and girl all won the top prize at the globe but never repeated at the emmy which were busy giving roughly a million trophy to the west wing frasier and modern family steve carell jennifer garner amy poehler and hugh laurie all have golden globe for iconic performance on the office alias park and recreation and house respectively that never earned them emmy keri russell and katey sagal have globe for felicity and son of anarchy'but not even emmy nomination for those performance maybe helen hunt deserved her four consecutive emmy award for mad about you and maybe there 's a case for candice bergen needing five emmy in seven year for murphy brown but while the emmy were rubber stamping their win year in and year out the like of kirstie alley cheer roseanne barr roseanne cybill shepard cybill jenna elfman dharma and greg and calista flockhart ally mcbeal were taking turn at the globe podium golden globe nomination alone can be enough to signal that an under the radar show is worth sampling but a win can take that show to a whole new level you saw that last year when a win for transparent legitimized for mainstream america what had previously been a critical darling and when the resplendent gina rodriguez tearfully accepted her trophy for jane the virgin and offered a speech overflowing with joy and emotion it mirrored those very aspect of jane and won over viewer who were maybe hesitant to give it a try a win this year for an underrated series like casual or a cable series like outlander or mr robot'two show paving the way for the future of the prestige drama'could have the same effect plus the golden globe nominated sarah michelle gellar for buffy the vampire slayer when the emmy never did so that 's the only thing that should need to be said about it taste level the organization ha served a similar function a hollywood kingmaker on the film side too it even used to have a new star of the year award the one pia zadora controversially took home to cement it that trophy is now defunct but the organization still ha the same power for all the eye rolling over the tendency of the hfpa to engage in the crudely named practice of starfucking'being seduced into nominating movie and actor just because they 're super duper famous'there 's a le popular argument to be made in defense of this practice particularly when it 's used to catapult rising talent to the a list it made a star out of hugh jackman who made his first big hollywood splash after his surprise nomination in the slight though charming romantic comedy kate and leopold a nomination for jennifer lopez for selena is another good example of this emily blunt wa a golden globe winner long before ascending the hollywood rank and scarlett johansson wa a four time nominated globe darling before becoming a major hollywood player herself a nomination for emma stone for easy a skyrocketed her career occasionally too the globe serve a a corrective for performance and film the more traditional and predictable academy award is n't adventurous enough to reward jim carrey for example earned a much deserved golden globe for eternal sunshine of the spotless mind before being snubbed by oscar in recent year jake gyllenhaal nightcrawler robert redford all is lost michael fassbender shame and ryan gosling blue valentine all earned globe nomination for oscar worthy performance ignored by oscar sally hawkins won a globe for happy go lucky before being cruelly overlooked for even a nomination at the oscar greta gerwig france ha july delpy before midnight and julia louis dreyfus enough said were all globe nominee in for thrilling performance that did n't make the oscar cut globe nominee rachel weisz and tilda swinton gave arguably the best performance in and for deep blue sea and we need to talk about kevin respectively but came up empty a academy award contender the best comedy or musical category specifically ha been a haven for movie and their actor who are often ignored by the academy due to it historical bias against comedy back to the future inside llewyn davis borat the royal tenenbaums hedwig and the angry inch when harry met sally legally blonde home alone bridesmaid the hangover and ghostbusters spy and trainwreck two of the best reviewed and most entertaining film of are nominated for best picture at the globe doe a golden globe nod validate either of these film more than their box office total or glowing review did nod for sister act

156,9625291.0,2016-01-05T05:01:00+00:00,why hillary ca n't shake bill 's affair,it 's the 'bimbo eruption redux a you may have seen paula jones reappeared on sunday giving a lengthy interview to a conservative radio host that brietbart com pantingly promoted charging that hillary clinton is the enemy of american woman the same day clinton wa heckled up in new hampshire by a female republican state representative to answer for the allegation against her husband regarding two woman who say bill clinton assaulted or raped them back we go to the s will any of this matter most of it wo n't the vast majority of voter are n't going to care about the and year old alleged sexual activity of an almost septuagenarian man but hillary doe have a potential achilles heel here which she opened the door to herself with one word she uttered back in september and she may yet have a little explaining to do here to nail down a voting bloc that she 's going to need in a big way come november first what wo n't matter monica lewinsky wo n't matter gennifer flower wo n't matter these were consensual relationship whatever else people might think of bill 's judgment most folk quite rightly consider these affair to be his and the woman 's private business either could decide to make trouble if they wanted to i guess especially lewinsky but i have trouble seeing how big trouble could really be made but what about jones and kathleen willey and juanita broaddrick they claim not that they had consensual relation with bill but that he did unwanted thing to them jones said he exposed himself to her and propositioned her in willey charged he groped her in the white house in and broaddrick alleged that he raped her in these thing have all been masticated a thousand million time bill clinton denies all three allegation with jones he settled a civil suit for admitting no guilt she did n't help her case back then by attaching herself to conservative movement lawyer and organization and letting her suit become the vehicle for what wa undeniably a conspiracy'perhaps not vast a hillary famously charged on the today show in but certainly right wing'to lay clinton low by any mean necessary with respect to willey she changed her story and wa ultimately regarded by the independent counsel that wa sniffing clinton 's bed sheet a an unreliable witness broaddrick 's charge is obviously the most serious but inconsistency have been noted here too and it 's now almost year old willey and broaddrick have n't been that vocal recently for her part jones say well lot of stuff hillary 'needs to do a public apology or something or other for all the woman who have come out and said publicly what her husband did to them yes she doe i believe she doe hillary is 'such a liar and she 's so two faced i never once wa contacted by her not one time and apologized about what her husband did to me 'i do n't see how woman would even be able to trust her if the man who is her husband who ha abused and harassed and did other thing to woman and she knew about it if jones had more savvy she 'd have planned her reemergence a lot more cleverly than she did instead of going to conservative talk radio she 'd have tried npr or something maybe npr would n't touch it but someplace more mainstream and she 'd have said something like yes i regret that i let my case get hijacked by people with other agenda that wa wrong but they were the only one listening to me at the time if her goal is actually to keep hillary clinton out of the white house she need to move the needle get people to take her seriously who did n't then and she sure did n't accomplish that but hillary clinton still is n't in the clear here back last september in iowa she said the word 'today i want to send a message to every survivor of sexual assault do n't let anyone silence your voice you have the right to be heard you have the right to be believed and we 're with you obviously 'believed is the operative word there and quite reasonably conservative pounced on it at the time oh well then do jones willey broaddrick deserve to be 'believed a michelle goldberg noted last week at slate a voter asked clinton essentially this in new hampshire in december and her answer wa n't the greatest 'well i would say that everybody should be believed at first until they are disbelieved based on evidence the other potential complication for clinton may center around the question of what she did if anything to discredit jones and the others jones said this in her interview too it 's been a given for year on the anti clinton right that hillary macbeth orchestrated vicious campaign to discredit these woman the mainstream press ha never really picked this up to conservative that 's because of liberal medium bias to the rest of u it 's because there 's been no hard evidence of this and because there exists a long long long list of thing they 've accused hillary of doing that she pretty obviously never did chance are assuming no corroborating evidence turn up in any of these three case most voter are n't going to be very interested but hillary clinton still ha to think through how she handle this a goldberg noted in her piece the politics around sexual harassment and assault have changed a lot since the s in way that are for the better in general but sure do n't strengthen hillary 's hand if when she ha to discus these case directly in addition she 'll need to bear in mind when she doe talk about all this that for most woman voter this story is n't about the old 'vast right wing conspiracy of which most will have at best a fleeting memory it 's about the reality of sexual predation in their life that state representative from new hampshire who heckled her wa 'very rude a clinton said but she is also a rape survivor a are million of other american woman that 's the audience clinton will need to speak to not liberal who remember who linda tripp wa she 'll need a big woman 's vote compared to any of the republican she ha the track record to have earned it conservative of course know this so carrying on about bill is the way they 'll try to neutralize her advantage it 's a bit rich to see member of the party that voted against the violence against woman act among numerous other position playing the role of defender of woman but that 's how it 's going to be clinton might have to dance away from that 'believed at some point and it 's going to be a delicate dance,379446.0

thing or two about american history when sen bernie sander spoke at georgetown university to explain what he mean when he say he is a 'democratic socialist in november he may have waited too long do so given hillary clinton 's lead in the poll her endorsement and the vast amount of money she ha raised it may now be all but impossible for sander to prevail and yet he must stay in the race for the nomination'not only to pull clinton to the left but also to continue to cultivate american ' progressive historical memory for if american are to confront the crisis we face and redeem the nation from year of class war from above'a class war that ha devastated america 's industry and public infrastructure created plutocratic inequality of wealth and power and empowered corporate executive and conservative politician to lay siege to the hard won right of worker woman and blacks'then we need to remember what truly ha made america great if not dare i say it exceptional it may not be true that we 'have it in our power to begin the world over again a thomas paine fervently told his fellow citizen to be in his revolutionary pamphlet common sense but a the crisis struggle and event of the s s and s and s'not to mention the s'powerfully attest when we have gotten it in our head to rise up and harness the power of democratic government to secure america 's purpose and promise we not only have succeeded in defending the united state against powerful enemy but also in making it both stronger and more prosperous and freer more equal and more democratic in the process not too surprisingly the gop candidate have been doing everything they can to ignore or suppress the memory of that history ever since ronald reagan ran for the presidency in and far more successfully in republican have done their damnedest to not simply hijack history but also to bury it evidently enamored of the gilded age and the prospect of returning u to it conservative have either repeatedly lied about the progressive and social democratic achievement of th century america or a we have witnessed at the debate spoken a if all of it had never happened of course prior to bernie 's georgetown speech recalling fdr 's new deal initiative and vision of an economic bill of right lbj 's great society and war on poverty and martin luther king 's commitment to democratic socialism the democrat had done little to historically challenge the republican yes hillary launched her campaign at the fdr four freedom park in new york city and yes bernie cutely remarked at the democratic debate in de moines iowa that he is le of a socialist than wa republican president dwight eisenhower because he would not seek to raise tax on the rich to the level that had prevailed during ike 's administration in the s however clinton martin o'malley and sander have made no real effort to remind american of how the nation 's greatest generation and greatest leader triumphed over the crisis they confronted and in that light what we might endeavor to do today if the democrat want to do more than win the presidency and carry out a bernie sander declares a 'political revolution they need to start redeeming america 's greatest generation and those who inspired and led them they need to lay claim to our greatest radical and to our greatest president not just fdr'but also washington and especially lincoln all of those forefather came to pursue both radical democratic action and progressive nation building roosevelt himself observed in the early s that it wa time for the democrat to lay claim to not just the democratic republican thomas jefferson whom he liberated from southern control but also the republican abraham lincoln whom he wa convinced the gop had abandoned long ago and fdr definitely had in mind not just lincoln the emancipator but also lincoln the nation builder in fact the nd president regularly quoted the th president to explain his own view of the role of government 'the legitimate object of government is to do for a community of people whatever they need to have done but can not do at all or can not do a well for themselves in their separate and individual capacity long before orwell wrote fdr knew the struggle for the present and future begin a a struggle for the past his best fireside chat and speech were essentially history lessons'lessons in which he reminded his fellow citizen of america 's purpose and promise a the great experiment in freedom equality and democracy and explained to them how his new deal initiative embodied the nation 's finest value and aspiration moreover he reminded american that what had been achieved by earlier generation came not simply by executive action from above but by way of struggle from the bottom up if the democrat hope to counter year of reaganesque rhetoric hyping limited government lower tax and corporate freedom they need to emulate their too long neglected presidential champion fdr they need to study up on u s history and make clear to their fellow american how their progressive argument and policy proposal emanate from the best of american history and politics with those labor in mind i heartily recommend that hillary martin and bernie read holzer and garfinkle 's new book on lincoln and his legacy a just and generous nation is a work of two part in part one holzer and garfinkle portray lincoln a a man who wa convinced that america had been created for a purpose'to make real the declaration 's proposition that 'all men are created equal and it promise of 'life liberty and the pursuit of happiness 'and who came to recognize that it wa his political task challenge and duty not simply to defend and secure that purpose and promise against those who would seek to deny them but also'as the preamble to the constitution states'to pursue democratic initiative to assure and advance them they do not exactly say it but holzer and garfinkle present lincoln a a pioneering progressive and a 'premature fdr liberal if not a proto social democrat i can already hear the shriek of conservative like most scholar holzer and garfinkle'the former a leading lincoln biographer the latter an accomplished economist and businessman'rightly insist that what drove lincoln 's commitment to sustain the union to fight the civil war the bloodiest war in american history and ultimately to abolish slavery and bring an end to the 'house divided wa his deeply held belief in america 's exceptional purpose and promise however holzer and garfinkle offer an essentially fresh take on all of that without at all slighting lincoln 's determination to hold the union together and his hatred of slavery for what it wa doing to american both black and white they forcefully and persuasively argue that lincoln 's understanding of american exceptionalism'america a the 'last best hope of earth 'was that the united state wa founded to be a land not just of civil equality and political democracy but also of 'economic democracy their lincoln saw america a tocqueville saw it a the world 's first 'middle class nation gross inequalities'slavery the grossest of them all'denied that vision if american native born and immigrant were to develop and sustain a middle class society in which opportunity abounded slavery needed to be contained and in time destroyed a holzer and garfinkle show by way of lincoln 's own word lincoln held that in contrast to the old regime land of europe and the rest of the world past and present the united state wa founded on an idea 'the idea that this country 'proposed to give all a chance ' and allow 'the weak to grow stronger ' therefore the union had to prevail over the confederacy to assure the survival of america 's world historic purpose and promise and slavery had to be destroyed to guarantee that purpose and promise for all american and again it wa not just a matter of securing the nation 's promise but also of advancing it a holzer and garfinkle recount from his early political day a a young whig who believed in henry clay 's american system through his trying time a the nation 's first republican president lincoln saw government action not a inherently and inevitably a threat to liberty and economic opportunity republican ai n't what they used to be but all the more a a potentially great democratic force that american might harness to foster economic growth and development create opportunity and empower working american to make something of themselves and the nation lincoln 's greatest and most radical act wa to sign the emancipation proclamation but even in the midst of the horror of war he and the congressional republican applied the power of democratic government to nation building most notably in he signed into law both the homestead act affording low priced acre tract of western land to settler and the morrill act aka the land grant act which granted public land to state to set up public college and no le historically important he chartered the first transcontinental railroad and signed a bill that set the precedent for the later creation of the u s national park system is n't all of this what lincoln himself wa saying at gettysburg in november a holzer and garfinkle put it when lincoln spoke of a 'new birth of freedom he wa referring not just to abolishing slavery but also to that of enhancing democratic government and the chance that american could continue to pursue the making of a middle class society 'government of the people and by the people had to become a well government 'for the people in the second part of their book holzer and garfinkle examine lincoln 's legacy the figure and force that turned their back on it and those who sought to redeem and advance it they take u through the republican dominated but anti lincolnian gilded age the progressive era of theodore roosevelt and woodrow wilson the new deal and second world war year of fdr and his re articulation of lincoln 's word and vision in the four freedom the postwar presidency of eisenhower kennedy and johnson and the making of lbj 's lincoln like great society initiative the reagan revolution and it anti lincolnian insistence that 'government is the problem and through the democratic and gop presidency of the past year these later chapter make their case for fdr and against not only ronald reagan but also jimmy carter whose deregulation of capital and abandonment of labor paved the way for reagan though i would add that holzer and garfinkle are much too kind to bill clinton who enacted nafta blundered terribly on national health care and'bringing about the great recession'brought an end to fdr 's glass steagall act the book is flawed in other way a well it present a history from the top down in holzer and garfinkle 's narrative president act and we all watch and benefit or suffer the consequence before writing holzer and garfinkle should have read the work by james oakes ira berlin and john nichols that reveal how lincoln wa moved to act by radical abolitionist and slave and working people themselves still if hillary martin and bernie want to redeem american democracy and save american middle class society from the throe of plutocracy and the evil of class war from above they would do very well to read a just and generous nation,7723.0

shenanigan ritualized across the country every year painting a damning portrait of the seductive lure of belonging that ha enticed young men to go greek for a century but what happens when the hard

'these are male issue what doe masculinity mean to a certain demographic of a generation now that 's trying to find a rite of passage find a definition of manhood 'at the core is this concept of modern day masculinity and what that mean but also brotherhood'and not the love you think you want but the love you actually need added jonas he waxed older and wiser on the fragile volatility of today 's modern man 'i think there 's a distorted view because of the inability to be honest and to be transparent a a man sometimes'especially at that age he said 'it 's a taxing age in the sense of

to relearn how to be a family which is kind of a big thing 'i would say i 'm very close with my brother now especially my brother joe he paused 'actually that relationship wa a big part of the

catchy donald trump campaign theme song 'freedom 's call performed by usa freedom kid a jingoistic girlband at a trump rally earlier this month in pensacola florida but it 's also a neat distillation of trump 's entire worldview'and an explanation for his decision announced tuesday night to boycott the upcoming republican debate hosted by fox news on thursday in de moines because he dislike megyn kelly one of the moderator trump is following the playbook he laid out himself in 's the art of the deal the second best book next to the bible according to it author trump 's preoccupation with negotiating from a place of strength is clear from the outset of the text his older brother freddy he wrote could n't hack it in the family business because 'he wa n't the kind of guy who could stand up to a killer contractor or negotiate with a rough supplier but unlike freddy his younger brother wa a natural just like his father according to the art of the deal the donald once negotiated with businessman charles blackburn to buy his company 's luxury complete with a bedroom a bath and a working area for million a new he boasted 'sells for approximately million the key to becoming a master negotiator like this trump wrote wa to 'use your leverage 'the worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it he wrote 'that make the other guy smell blood and then you 're dead the best thing you can do is deal from strength and leverage is the biggest strength you have leverage is having something the other guy want or better yet need or best of all simply ca n't do without but trump acknowledged 'that is n't always the case which is why leverage often requires imagination and salesmanship in other word you have to convince the other guy it 's in his interest to make the deal nearly year have passed since trump explained this tactic and now he 's putting it to use on fox news 'as someone who wrote one of the best selling business book of all time the art of the deal who ha built an incredible company including some of the most valuable and iconic asset in the world and a someone who ha a personal net worth of many billion of dollar mr trump know a bad deal when he see one trump said in a statement announcing his decision to forgo thursday 's event 'mr trump know when to walk away why trump would walk away from the center of the republican debate stage in iowa just four day before the caucus seemed to mystify some in the establishment in the polling average trump lead his closest competitor ted cruz by point at and a the debate have gone on trump ha only gotten better and better at performing in them in the most recent debate on jan he seemed to come out on top of cruz who at the time wa threatening to overtake him in the hawkeye state

denouncing trump in it latest issue wondered on cnn just a the news wa announced 'really he 's so offended that he ca n't possibly show up there on the stage one republican strategist told me that it would be 'hard to say what he turn it into his campaign ha existed in free publicity but this could cut both way but trump ha succeeded so far by flouting establishment convention before his candidacy few would have predicted that alienating entire race and religion or fighting with the republican national committee or making enemy out of the conservative elite would make for a successful primary campaign yet for seven month trump ha led the poll and packed ten of thousand of people into stadium while doing just that he ha created a populist movement and he ha only himself and his zany decision to thank trump ha always been upfront about what motivates him even a he ha flip flopped on what he supposedly belief he ha never held back never been shy about it never couched it in caveat

chronicling james ' career tried to put the kibosh on such speculation tweeting that 'james wa informed of the decision to fire david blatt today he wa not consulted on decision source said but according to windhorst 'james ' fondness for ty lue and his desire to be coached by a former player were well known in the organization a were issue with blatt sic that wa followed by this tweet from yahoo sport ' adrian wojnarowski 'then again since last season lebron james and his agent rich paul have been strong advocate of lue becoming head coach league source tell yahoo despite a record of in his first year and a half in the nba the whisper that king james wa n't exactly thrilled with blatt 's performance and generally preferred communicating with lue have been burbling since last january when it wa reported by windhorst that ' league scout executive and rival player see player appearing to run different play than the bench call see assistant coach tyronn lue calling timeouts literally behind blatt 's back during game and hear cavs player openly talking about coaching issue with opposing player and personnel not once not twice but frequently over the past several month in the midst of brutal stretch in which the cavs had lost six in a row during a particularly tepid effort versus a middling phoenix sun team james actually shoved blatt just a all of this wa coming to a head the cavalier reeled off a game winning streak and went and to close out the season james in particular looked like his old dominant self in a trend that continued through a final matchup against the eventual world champion golden state warrior in which he carried a wounded flawed roster on his voluminous shoulder of course the blatt james cold war flared up again in the playoff when lebron seemingly overruled blatt 's decision to have him inbound the ball with second left against the bull lebron instead canned a game winning jumper to even the series blatt wa hired before james announced he wa returning to cleveland and the pairing ha never quite worked out instead a bleacher report 's ethan skolnick described it it 's a relationship that resembles 'at best an uneasy alliance and at worst an arranged marriage of extreme inconvenience two people thrust together due to a timing glitch then subjected to the constant parsing of every comment but even if there is no smoking gun to directly tie blatt 's dismissal to james what ha become wholly self evident throughout the first half of the season is that the cavalier sit a distant third in the nba 's power ranking the defending champion warrior have somehow improved upon last year 's model going to start the season and overall steph curry ha transmogrified into an unstoppable shot making colossus draining thirty footer with an impish borderline zen ease and that 's before we get to the san antonio spur led by the greatest coach in nba history gregg popovich they have retooled their roster around an aging but still gobsmackingly effective trio of sure fire hall of famers in tim duncan tony parker and manu ginobili in defiance of the smallball three point happy modern nba they 've become a galactus like plodding half court destroyer of world couple that with a historically great defense and the spur may end up with a point differential the average point scored minus point allowed per game that might end up surpassing even the chicago bull on monday the cavalier were beaten to a pulp by curry et al and honestly it wa n't a close a the score suggests while it may seem odd to send the coach packing when the cavalier remain the prohibitive favorite to get back to the final there is n't much that the team can do to catch up to the league 's twin titan short of a radical roster reshuffling trade which carry a not insignificant risk of making a fraught situation far worse kevin love ha never really found a way to mesh his game with james ' and is an atrocious pick and roll defender'kryptonite for any team set to face a screen heavy golden state kyrie irving is still working his way back into form from a devastating knee injury in game one of the final and a motley

washington doe n't have much good to say about the current crop of presidential candidate when it come to confronting the so called islamic state and other jihadist the former cia chief and defense secretary told the council on foreign relation in new york last week 'i think middle school kid would be embarrassed by the level of dialogue going on in the national campaign 'i think that these guy men and woman are making these broad pronouncement and it 's clear they do n't know what they 're talking about gate said citing some of the more outrageous remark about making 'the sand glow 'carpet bombing and 'bombing the shit out of them which he attributed to 'the leading candidate meaning donald trump 'this is not a particularly sophisticated analysis of the challenge that we face gate told the think tank 's audience amid considerable laughter 'the worrying thing is if they actually believe what they are saying and if that is the case we really are in trouble so we are in a situation where the optimistic interpretation is they 're just being cynical and opportunistic but gate who served president obama a defense secretary during the first term dealt frankly with some of no drama obama 's failing a well 'i think that the president all along ha underestimated isi ha underestimated the degree of fear that they are able to provoke among a lot of american gate said 'the president i think ha completely misread the psychological impact of these lone wolf attack or these 'small scale attack ' that result in multiple casualty that have been sponsored by isi or by people radicalized by isi and acting a lone wolf this question of underestimated threat and misread reaction in fact ha been a problem across the board for the obama administration 's foreign policy particularly in recent year so on saturday when the ever active gate wa snowed in a block from the white house where he had dispensed information and vital insight to eight president i gave him a call to try to find out why obama ha been surprised again and again by dictator and indeed terrorist around the world gate nursing a bit of a cold mainly wanted to talk about his new book a passion for leadership lesson on change and reform from fifty year of public service but you ca n't talk about leadership in the united state and especially in foreign policy without talking about current and future president and gate nailed the problem with obama he is a hyper rationalist in what 's still an irrational world the view it should be said is not unique to gate a a longtime colleague of his at the cia observed in private a couple of week ago it may be wise to keep one 's adversary off balance and guessing just how crazy you might be one remembers president nixon 's famous and infamous 'madman theory trying to convince the north vietnamese in that he 'might do anything to stop the war that wa raging in southeast asia in the s the russian really were unsure how far president reagan would push them on land at sea in the air and most important in outer space president george w bush one might argue took the madman theory far too far launching a war in iraq that proved insanely destructive to u s interest obama on the other hand is a 'mature measured responsible individual a the veteran spook put it 'and vladimir putin and xi jinping and abu bakr al baghdadi'they do n't give a shit about mature measured and responsible gate rather more elegantly made much the same argument over the phone 'i think that philosophically the president and secretary of state john kerry have believed that they were at a point in history where the rule of law and rational decision making on these issue and a nation 's good understanding of it long term national interest would prevail gate told the daily beast 'but that certainly doe not apply to most of the rest of the world where you have leader who frankly are stuck in a th th century approach to advancing their nation ' interest and defending their nation ' interest gate said 'and from the standpoint of the person who is logical and rational you ask yourself 'why are they doing that that make no sense whatsoever ' the problem is not new gate remembered that when he wa at the cia in the consensus at the agency wa that the russian would not invade afghanistan there wa no reason for them to do it obviously it would be a huge mistake so even though moscow had to troop ready to cross the border the cia concluded 'we do n't think they 'll do it but of course they did similar unreal realism afflicts obama and kerry according to gate 'i just think that there 's a sense in their mind that the united state ha advanced to that kind of a rational assessment of it national interests'and 'why is n't everybody else lining up ' and it 's because nearly everybody else is stuck in an old paradigm how do you change that do we want credibly crazy people in office the veteran spook had suggested trump might qualify on that count again gate 's response wa more measured 'you have to start with what is logical and sensible and what 's common sense he said 'but then you have to present your policies'you have to talk about your policies'in a way that address these th and th century approach to problem solving case in point iran 'you may decide that a nuclear accord with iran is entirely in everybody 's interest including ours and the iranian ' said gate 'but at the same time you realize that there is a power struggle going on continually in iran and you basically announce in parallel with the arm control agreement 'and oh by the way here are the thing that we are going to do to strengthen our military presence and increase our engagement in the region a a way of reassuring our friend and ally in the region ' arguably that 's what the obama administration ha done or think it ha done but a gate see it there 's not a sharp enough edge the stand confronting iranian adventurism outside the framework of the nuclear agreement 'has been very weak said gate he would like to see 'something much broader than just more special ops force to fight isi and so on i am talking about a major u s initiative in term of an increased military presence increased military support for our friend and ally a major effort to get them to work together a a regional security effort and a comprehensive strategy on how you push back against iranian meddling 'the irony said gate 'is the ayatollah supreme leader ali khamenei announced exactly that thing on the iranian side 'just because we signed that agreement do n't expect u to change any of our behavior we are going to be just a aggressive going after the great satan ' the former cia chief and defense secretary ha said many time that he think president resort to force too often but that is distinct in fact from making a threat of force credible whether it is implicit or explicit gate like to cite the example of president eisenhower who wa the commander of allied force in europe in world war ii then president of the united state from to in the potentially apocalyptic early day of the cold war gate rattled off his accomplishment 'eisenhower came in faced a russia that had just developed a thermonuclear weapon china had just developed their own nuclear weapon for the first time he faced a french war in indochina where the u s joint chief of staff unanimously asked him to use nuclear weapon to help the french he faced repeated crisis with china over taiwan and the taiwan strait he faced a middle east war involving our closest ally and he got them to stop he faced revolution in east germany poland and hungary a revolution in cuba and yet between the time that he became president and signed the north korean armistice in the middle of until he left office not one american soldier wa killed in combat 'i do n't think dwight eisenhower wa a wimp said gate 'and the funny thing wa he did it all kind of effortlessly everybody thought all he did wa go out and play golf on the white house lawn and you know there wa n't a lot of bluster or anything he just got it done so getting back to the current campaign to choose the next president of the united state who doe gate favor he say there might be two or three among the candidate 'but only two or three who bring the skill needed and he 's not naming them one might surmise that hillary clinton or jeb bush could theoretically be on the gate short list but it 's clear that donald trump is not 'if you read the chapter on personal characteristic i require for successful leadership you would find that he probably doe not fill the bill on a number of those count said gate 'it 's just pure speculation but the kind of people he would likely surround himself with are they going to be

state of turmoil on the business side the social medium service ha been bleeding executive faster than the single joke emo kylo ren account gained follower this monday ceo jack dorsey announced'where else but in a tweet'that the company 's vp of engineering vp of human resource vp of global medium and senior vp of product have all 'chosen to leave the company 'the latest in a long line of high profile employee to jump ship from a user 's standpoint the product is a confused mess first 'hearts replaced 'favorites last november then in december twitter seemingly tried to trick user into discovering the moment feature by switching it place on the top bar with the oft used notification tab there wa revolt among the faithful and of course a chrome extension to reverse the change the next month twitter announced that one of the defining feature of the platform'the character limit'could change to allow tweet a long a character somewhere along the way poll started showing up on your timeline too after being introduced last october behind both of these mess is a single problem try a it might twitter ca n't seem to attract new user fast enough in the platform 's growth slowed hitting a wall just above million monthly active user in the social medium game where your value is determined not just by how many user you have but by your ability to gain more four million newcomer in one quarter is just not good enough to stay afloat for journalist and medium type who spend too much time scrolling through column on tweetdeck anyway'present company included'it 's a situation ripe for think piece about quitting twitter the death of twitter or the harassment that some suspect is stymying the growth of the platform but whatever trouble twitter ha on the surface there 's an underlying structural issue at stake there is n't one twitter there are two twitter and neither of them is the twitter that twitter want to be or need to be in order to grow on one hand there is entertainment twitter the land where comedian try out new material where teen refer to celebrity a 'mom and 'dad where beef between celebrity and politician are cheered on with cry of 'slay queen where wiz khalifa kanye west and amber rose duke it out with tweet storm and sexual insult where everyone 's waiting to see what martin shkreli will say next to ghostface killah this is twitter a spectacle a gladiator 's arena in which we are peasant who scroll past ad to keep watching millionaire fight each other on the other there is medium twitter an endless navel gazing churn of headline scoop and take of varying temperature this is the twitter for those with access to information and for those who fancy themselves informed it 's an awful place and all journalist know it but it continues because we have no choice but to participate a the daily beast 's lizzie crocker wrote of the recent 'quit twitter trend 'unless we want to become ice fisherman in alaska leaving the internet forever is a pipe dream at it best medium twitter is a place where vital story can reach a mass audience before most tv news anchor can even get out of hair and makeup at it worst it 's a place where people try to argue in earnest that spooning is sexist like any binary scheme this one 's drastically oversimplified and there are exception most notably black twitter which ha long used the service in a dynamic multi faceted way a a social tool political platform and intellectual meeting ground it 's also a kingmaker for diverse tv show like how to get away with murder and empire suffice it to say if everyone on twitter were a engaged a black twitter jack dorsey would be a happy ceo to break through it ceiling of roughly million user and to show advertiser the kind of number that warrant check twitter would have to be a place where people come not just to watch or stay informed but to be but twitter is a platform built on asymmetry and interpersonal interaction you have follower not friend you do n't share you retweet that 's part of why it current growing pain feel so alien when twitter announced in a video last november that it wa replacing the star icon with heart it came across a lot like well this popular gif of a skateboard toting steve buscemi saying 'how do you do fellow kid the release video tried to guide u into using heart to send each other message like 'adorbs 'aww 'stay strong and 'hugs 'show how you feel without missing a beat it suggested it wa hilarious the affective range of twitter seems to be limited to amusement mourning and anger both righteous and otherwise the idea that 'adorbs and 'aww are thing one regularly feel on twitter'outside of looking at the occasional photo of a puppy'was so clearly an aspirational move on twitter 's part and not a reflection of how people were using the service watching that twitter heart video wa like watching pinocchio wish he were a real boy there are social medium platform where such a product would feel more natural facebook currently dominates in monthly users'a full percent of online adult in the u s use it according to pew'because we live and yes sometimes even feel on it most of u do n't really live on twitter we come to it for celebrity gossip joke consumption self promotion or breaking news update and we leave we pay a visit to one or both of the two twitter and then go home'to facebook where people still unironically say thing to each other like 'stay strong 'aww and 'hugs facebook is now rolling out new emoji esque reaction like 'sad 'angry 'haha and 'love in addition to the 'like button and while that 's a big change it doe n't seem at odds with the nature of the service on the other side of the social medium aisle emotional expression come about a naturally to twitter a breakdancing doe to robocop and besides most of the thing that happen on entertainment and medium twitter eventually make it to facebook anyway a long a you do n't crave the adrenaline rush of breaking news you will get a general sense of what 's going on in the world'and what your favorite celebrity are up to'if you scroll through your feed long enough twitter is also struggling to stay competitive among the generation that would even utter a word like 'adorbs instagram and snapchat both have a higher percentage of user age to ' and percent respectively'than twitter 's percent according to comscore data this is in part because instagram and snapchat seamlessly combine the appeal of entertainment twitter'having a direct window into the life of the rich and famous'with the kind of intensely personal expression that seems so ill fitted for twitter medium twitter too ha noticed the success of these visual platform and now snapchat 's discover feature ha become the hot new place to scrounge for view and mobile user most importantly these other social medium service are n't hopelessly fragmented in the way that twitter is there 's one facebook experience for everyone and sure it may look like a jumbled mess of multi generational political argument family photo news article and viral video but that 's what facebook is and it 's come to feel strangely cohesive on instagram there 's a certain unifying logic between seeing what khloe kardashian is wearing to brunch and posting a filtered photo of your frittata not so with twitter where celebrity unleash candid photo on their fan journalist scream take like this one into the void and everyone else is not quite sure why they use it except that their one journalist friend told them to make an account the big problem facing the struggling social medium giant is that neither of the two twitter have thing to offer that most user ca n't get elsewhere and perhaps the total number of people who need those thing with the level of immediacy that twitter offer is finite million and very few more entertainment twitter is where we go for drama medium twitter is where we go for news to grow and therefore survive twitter would need to keep these two offering on tap while also gluing them together with something that ha always eluded it the human touch it would have to feel more like one twitter not two,4217.0

parent of the triplet she 's carrying claiming his alleged wish to terminate one of the fetus entitles her to keep at least one of the baby which are all unrelated to her and if it come down to it she say she 'll take all of them 'i will be prepared to take all three melissa cook told the daily beast 'i feel for the father to be perfectly honest but you ca n't just have such disregard for human life cook say she no longer see surrogacy in a favorable light and in her legal complaint she claim both she and the fetus are victim of what is in effect baby selling the year old'already a traditional mother to four child including a previous set of triplets'is now week pregnant with the triplet produced from the single georgia man 's sperm and egg from a year old donor according to her lawsuit filed in los angeles county superior court on monday the lack of a genetic tie should have no bearing on cook 's status a the mother 'the bonding process between the pregnant mother and the child she carry during the nine month of pregnancy is the same physical process and experience whether or not the mother is genetically related to the child the complaint read the bonding process is both psychological and physiological it can not be wished away and it is not prevented or diminished by the existence of a written surrogacy contract or any of the promise or intention expressed therein the intended father disagrees 'as much a she think she ha some right via intrautero bonding i think these kid have a far greater right to be raised together a sibling with their genetic biological parent the intended father 's lawyer robert walmsley said in an interview with the daily beast when contacted for comment walmsley said the surrogate 's lawsuit wa news to him and claimed cook 's most recent contact with the intended father wa allegedly a letter asking about her payment check cook 's contract stipulated she would receive for acting a a surrogate with per additional child the contract also had a reduction clause'whereby the intended father could request an abortion in the event of multiple pregnancies'which is commonplace for surrogacy arrangement using in vitro fertilization though cook agreed in the contract to abort one of the fetus if the intended father requested it when the possibility became a reality cook refused 'they are human being i bonded with these kid this is just not right cook told the new york post last month walmsley again denied the allegation that his client had tried to pressure cook to abort one of the fetus and said while money associated with triplet care wa a factor 'the primary motivating force wa the safety of the surrogate and the child walmsley called the lawsuit 's demand 'outrageous especially the suggestion that cook should take one of the triplet thereby separating the sibling 'what are we going do get a referee meet on the fifty yard line and flip a coin my client is not doing that he 's keeping the three child cook is being represented by a well known anti choice lawyer harold cassidy'which walmsley hardly see a coincidence ' cassidy 's agenda is to stop surrogacy to stop hundred of thousand of childless individual from having this science available to them to prevent them from having kid at any cost cassidy represented surrogate mother mary beth whitehead in the case over 'baby m the first time a u s court took up the question of surrogacy whitehead had conceived with donated sperm from the intended parents'a wealthy family in new jersey'but refused to give up the child after she wa born ultimately the intended father retained custody of the child but the state supreme court ruled that paid surrogacy wa illegal in the last two decade cassidy ha retained his interest in motherhood and the unborn devoting his practice to in his view protecting pregnant mothers'in most case by restricting access to abortion and consulting with and defending state legislature that pas law that force woman to undergo scientifically questionable counseling a informed consent before an abortion 'surrogacy a epitomized by the contract between cook and the intended father is a plan to deprive a child of his or her mother to create a motherless class of child and to place custody of child without any regard for their best interest cassidy said in a statement provided to the daily beast 'in many way the intended father is a victim too cassidy told the daily beast 'doctors and surrogacy broker stripped him of his life saving and left him in a position to think that he ha to raise three child there is no federal law regulating surrogacy and state law vary wildly california is one of eight state that allow for legal contract that compensate for gestational surrogacy'where a woman carry a pregnancy to which she is not genetically linked'and the intended parent ' name can go on a birth certificate in michigan new jersey new york and washington paid surrogacy is illegal and in washington d c it is a crime after reviewing cook 's complaint joanna grossman hofstra university law professor and author of inside the castle law and the family in th century america said 'the argument that california 's surrogacy law is unconstitutional ha no merit 'the most likely scenario is that he get all three baby and a the only adult with parental right ha the power to place any or

political incorrectness in general yes bill maher wa on vacation but the acerbic satirist seems recharged and ready to dive headfirst into election season'which he 'll do by kicking off the return of his late night series real time with bill maher with a big campaign of his own you 'll have to tune in to hbo friday night to see exactly what it is all teasing aside maher 's built up a considerable amount of cynicism during his tv absence a he 's observed the mindboggling rise of donald trump to leading gop candidate for president'this despite a troubling history of 'sexist and 'xenophobic behavior'as well a that of tea partier ted cruz r tx the day after president obama 's state of the union address'and south carolina governor nikki haley 's trump bashing response'and hour before the new york time broke the news that cruz had failed to disclose up to million in loan from goldman sachs which he used to finance his senate run the daily beast spoke to maher about the election including why cruz scare him even more than trump and the big scandal that may dash hillary clinton 's presidential hope it 's good timing for our chat the day after president obama 's state of the union address what did you think of obama 's speech i thought it wa his best one yet although he certainly did break his promise about it being short i wa like 'oh great i 'll be out of here in a half hour ' but i thought it wa great that for once the state of the union wa n't a laundry list he mentioned everything up front and then it wa much more thematic a guy looking back with perspective and breadth a lot of what he said needed to be said it 's probably stuff that made the republican mad like 'that wa the lesson of vietnam that wa the lesson of iraq well yeah that wa the lesson of iraq but that 's what the republican fuckin ' hated because they hate to learn lesson what about nikki haley 's state of the union response it seemed to signal a widening gap in the republican party going after donald trump well compared to rubio and jindal she looked like the lincoln douglas debate by republican standard i think she did ok and a far a her taking a sideswipe at trump i thought that wa interesting because clearly there is a civil war brewing in this party and it 's going to have to come to a head she 's going to have to take on not just donald trump but the sixty five percent of republican who agree with him on banning muslim if that 's what she wa complaining about then she 's got a bigger fight on her hands'as do all the republican establishment'than just donald trump that 's their problem they created this monster in the party and now it 's taking over they did the same thing with the christian coalition almost thirty year ago and now they 've redone it with the tea party what they should 've done when the tea party first emerged wa to say 'you 're your own party you 're not the republican party the republican party is bob dole george bush i not these crank but of course they can never resist people who vote for them and the tea party seemed to be at least partially born of racism against obama more like totally born bred and raised from racism of course there 's a number of thing that prove it but obama ha mostly completed their agenda he cut tax on ninety eight percent of american he cut the deficit by two third he reduced the size of government which is something that bush and reagan never did and yet they still hate him what could it be i am always racking my brain is it because he 's skinny what could it be that 's of course what it is there wa no tea party during bush despite the financial collapse the bailout of the bank the bailout of the automobile industry'all of this 'socialist money out the window the thing that they supposedly hate and yet no movement of concerned white taxpayer sprouting up but suddenly a month after count chocula take office they break out the three cornered hat when you talk about the tea party and the brewing civil war within the republican party it 's a tea partier'ted cruz'who 's the one nipping at donald trump 's heel ted cruz is scarier than donald trump because i think donald trump despite some of the crazy thing he say and some of the disgusting thing she say he also say some thing that a liberal can love his stance on getting out of the middle east and being against the iraq war is stuff that wa pretty consistent with what obama wa saying last night and also taking on hedge fund manager it just show that people in this country are so out of it politically that ideology doe n't really matter anymore when putin wa praising trump and joe scarborough said to him 'you know putin murder journalist trump 's response wa 'yeah we kill people too that 's the kind of thing noam chomsky say you know so look trump would be a disaster a president do n't get me wrong but i think he could actually be turned around on some issue because he 's already been turned around right before he wa a liberal practically the big one for me that is troubling is seeing him throw in with the republican rank and file on global warming being a hoax but he 's very easily swayed by celebrity i think if we sent leonardo dicaprio over to trump tower on a secret mission we could get him to believe global warming is real back to ted cruz why do you find him scarier than trump he is certainly more cunning than him and a far more educated guy with princeton harvard law and his constitutional law background it 's high intelligence in the service of evil it 's one thing to have evil people who are n't that bright there 's a reason why everyone hate ted cruz there 's a reason why the big question about ted cruz is always 'when he shave in the morning how doe he avoid spitting in the mirror to think of this guy being the president of the united state this ambition and love of power combined with being on the wrong side of every issue it 's a very scary prospect now that cruz is gaining in the poll trump is focusing on whether or not cruz can actually be president since he wa born in canada whether or not anyone think the constitution should be changed it doe plainly say that you have to be a 'natural born citizen to be the president of the united state and he is not that is what 's in the constitution to me what 's interesting about that is the way donald trump even though he 's not a career politician seems to instinctively understand what so many career politician have trained for year to learn which is how to defeat an opponent how to go after his weakness look at what he 's doing to hillary clinton now he 's taken a page from the karl rove lee atwater book find the person 's weak point'which sometimes can be their strong point they went after john kerry for being a war hero and he wa a war hero somehow they made the draft dodger into more of a patriot than the guy who went to vietnam and fought bravely and hillary 's ace card is woman and he 's turning that on her head by relitigating monica lewinsky well it 's not just lewinsky he 's relitigating bill clinton 's entire scandalous past with woman from juanita broaddrick all the way up to lewinsky sure juanita broaddrick paula jones kathleen willey gennifer flower and let 's not forget the jeffrey epstein plane that went to orgy island i 'm very curious about when the jeffrey epstein stuff will come up because evidence wise that seems the most damning yeah because that sound like the kind of circle donald trump travel in and know someone like that it 's interesting what happened with that because it came up then clinton put the quash on it 'yeah i met him a couple of time i wa on his plane i never saw any underage russian hooker maybe they were in coach and i wa in first class not even a hooker but an alleged 'sex slave who claim clinton visited 'orgy island right right if that came back in a way that wa damaging to bill clinton god underage russian hooker and sex slave christ you can get through a few thing in american politics but now we 're in roman polanski territory when you talk about hillary now bernie sander is really right behind her he 's polling ahead of her in several state and other poll contend that he 's polling better against the gop candidate than hillary'though that notion seems more then a little far fetched i know you semi endorsed bernie on the show so the real question is can bernie actually be elected president of the united state this is the exact question that i 'm going to be asking the panel this week and it 's a question that did n't have a much relevance until this week now that he 's almost even in the poll now that we are plainly six month into the trump era'the era when there are no more rule in american politics'you kind of have to throw away the rule book and say 'we do n't know it 's completely uncharted territory it 's like there are two election going on one is between the republican and the democrat and one is between the establishment and the anti establishment and i know nate silver and lot of other people say it 's impossible for donald trump to get elected president but a i 've always said something is impossible until it is n't and so far donald trump ha defied everybody 's prediction and he 's still there and he only seems to get stronger the guy eats third rail for breakfast i mean what would he have to say he 's already said 'carly fiorina you 're too ugly to be president john mccain you 're not a war hero hey would you like to see my impression of a guy with cerebral palsy i mean what would he have to do fart in jesus ' face or call ronald reagan a fag i have no idea what this guy would have to do to make his crowd turn on him he 's like a movie monster who only get stronger with the stuff that you 're using to try to kill him so with this atmosphere i think anything is possible'and that mean bernie sander is possible it is pretty rich for donald trump to be going after bill clinton for his numerous affair when donald trump wa reportedly having sex with marla maple while his wife ivana and their three child were at church people do n't think or vote logically they like trump he excites something in the lizard part of their brain and he know how to touch a certain sensitive point in the kind of people who are nothing like him and have absolutely nothing in common with a billionaire well besides his trumped up accent yeah exactly but he talk about how america doe n't win anymore and how we 're going to be great again and he ha his pulse on people the way few politician before him have with hillary what is going on bernie 's right at her heel and she 's going on ellen degeneres ' show and dabbing her attempt at appearing 'human and endearing are laughably transparent connecting wa never her strong suit she 's a policy wonk which is the democrat ' strong suit they understand government they 're sometimes no prize themselves but compared to trump and ben carson they do n't have to be taught the name of the continent and they know how government work look she 's too centrist for me and she 's too in bed with wall street and monsanto but she 'd be a capable leader i would n't be concerned with her blowing the world up,304124.0

proposed regulation that would end 'unfair and deceptive act and practice that may arise in the gaming process while the daily fantasy sport dfs company have previously expressed a willingness to work with legislator and law enforcement official to create industry wide regulation massachusetts attorney general maura healey 's regulation might prove seriously damaging to their bottom line especially if they end up being replicated in other state a great deal of what 's being proposed scan a fairly standard non threatening consumer protection in brief they would require that dfs operator be truthful in their advertising promotional offer comply with the state 's existing law and regulation provide the tool for player to self report any suspected violation set a year old age limit and more the year old age limit is a point of contention for dfs operator who claim that it 's arbitrarily derived from the standard set by casino beyond the loss of revenue from year old anything that suggests a connection between the dfs industry and gambling is bound to be a nonstarter in their eye employee of the industry would also be barred from entering dfs contest and prohibit any sharing of proprietary information or data this of course is a direct response to the revelation that a draftkings employee had won in a single day but healey is n't stopping there the regulation also limit loss by any single player to per month though there is space for a carve out should user be able to demonstrate that they 're able to withstand greater loss remove any single customer 's ability to create multiple account and ban the use of script that 's what 's causing the dfs industry to chafe or a griffin finan draftkings ' legal counsel stated in the hearing these regulation 'will have a significant effect on the industry and will be costly and complicated to implement the daily beast spoke with daniel wallach a prominent sport and gaming attorney who provided expert testimony at tuesday hearing he explained that the dfs company are resisting an attempt to correct what appears to be a massive imbalance in term of who is cashing in on dfs contest 'the biggest consumer protection issue in dfs is the loss rate he said ' of winning going to close to of the player and over of the player overall are reporting net loss is that just simply a matter of small percentage of player being so highly skilled that they 're crushing the field or is in some measure related to the number of entry and the ability to mass enter contest and make automated last minute lineup change 'i would think that if you 're going to provide consumer protection you 've got to start with leveling the playing field he added it 's a playing field that seems to need some serious leveling in the new york time jay caspian kang described daily fantasy a a 'rapacious ecosystem in which high volume gambler often aided by computer script and optimization software that allow player to submit hundred or even thousand of lineup at a time such that they can 'repeatedly take advantage of new player in poker this practice is referred to a 'bumhunting according to kang and when draftkings and fanduel realized what wa happening instead of figuring out how to protect the rube they instead 'enacted rule that in the end are likely to protect the high volume player rather than regulate them the problem for the dfs company is that their ability to offer million dollar payouts is dependent on maintaining the status quo cap the amount that the shark can wrest from a never ending pool of inexperienced minnow many of whom were lured by the ad promising improbable overnight rich take away the shark ' ability to carpet bomb high paying contest and remove the software required to manage thousand of entry and make last minute change and you 're going to put a serious dent in the industry 's coffer that would be the case in massachusetts at least when you actually set up rule that protect consumer yes the industry is going to take a hit of course that 's assuming they 're capable of solving some of the problem a representative from fanduel told kang that 'dfs company can not reliably detect script on their site during tuesday 's hearing peter schoenke the chairman of the fantasy sport trade association offered a slightly different rationale saying that a broad ban on script would 'hurt innovation in our industry for wallach neither explanation hold much water 'it 's nonsense wallach said of the industry 's ability to detect the use of script 'to throw their hand up in the air and say they 're powerless to do anything about it strain credulity where there 's ingenuity and resource it can happen these are technology company that are innovative and are at the cutting edge of a new online gaming product it 's difficult to believe that they 're powerless to do anything about it via email when told of schoenke 's statement he wa equally dubious wallach wa late arriving to the hearing and wa not present when schoenke spoke 'it 's an issue of fairness not innovation he wrote 'winners should be determined by skill in selecting the right lineup not whom ha the better automation tool innovation will not suffer one iota through regulation restricting or limiting script but wallach wa n't surprised that industry rep objected to some of the proposed regulation 'anything that can be seen a curtailing operator ' ability to generate revenue is certainly going to be pushed back on because it would be a drag on their revenue he said 'there 's a vast multitude of player who wager in excess of a thousand dollar a month i 've had player call me asking for representation i know several that are in the hole for six figure this regulation is designed to curb or limit problem gambling at it most severe during the hearing finan questioned whether there wa a need for regulatory limit on loss instead he maintained that consumer are in the best position to set their own limit 'of course draftkings will oppose any player spending limit wallach emailed in response 'if they were to acquiesce on that it could invite similar regulatory measure in other state and once the genie leaf the bottle she ai n't coming back while it might ameliorate to some degree 'problem playing ' issue it would also adversely impact draftkings ' bottom line and to be sure the latter is certainly more important to draftkings and it shareholder the regulation wo n't be implemented until 'sometime this winter a soon a possible after the conclusion of the comment period on january nd richard johnston the chief legal counsel of the massachusetts attorney general 's office said but if they remain more or le intact they 'll serve a a potent model for other state to follow 'the gold standard according to wallach that doe n't mean the industry wo n't continue to negotiate behind the scene a spokesman for draftkings told the daily beast that despite their concern they would continue to work with the attorney general 's office on 'the substance of the regs to 'achieve an outcome that work for the industry and consumer then again in massachusetts 'they have no choice wallach said 'maura healey is a powerful law enforcement officer he continued 'and draftkings is headquartered in massachusetts to some extent they have to play ball with healey i think a you move from state to state they 'll fight similar regulation but let 's face fact this is gambling and there doe need to be robust consumer protection 'imposing those requirement is not antithetical to the success or the continued viability of the industry it 's going to have regulation you might a well make it meaningful,8009.0

type and it 's not me at all she might a well have just called out the network on a show with a notorious penchant for one kind of woman'in a nutshell young blonde demure and almost always white'jubilee stand out black haitian born jubilee is a war veteran she 's socially awkward and obsessed with hot dog she refuse to attend a mean girl meeting where she is the intended target and she ha a backstory so tragic'she 's the only surviving member of her family'that only emily maynard 's could rival it jubilee is such an anomaly that one of the four laurens competing for the bachelor 's love lament 'ben want to have a wife that will be friend with all the other soccer mom jubilee the blonde had concluded is not that kind of girl twitter erupted with charge of microaggressions and low key racism but ben certainly seems to like her by giving jubilee a rose ben elevated her beyond the other black woman who usually appear on the show who are most often eliminated before a one on one date often before we can even remember their name the rise of weird tough jubilee arguably the most authentic contestant to subject herself to the bachelor treatment made me wonder if she could actually win even better'when fan have been lobbying for a more diverse cast'could she be the next bachelorette who better to ask than the woman in whose footstep jubilee now treds i talked to three black woman who appeared on the bachelor about their experience on the show to find out what they thought of jubilee 's chance spoiler they 're not so good their response have been edited for space and clarity marshana ritchie season bachelor matt grant what wa the bachelor like for you it wa good the bachelor the producer on the show and everyone behind the scene were amazing a were some of the girl in the house on the flip side the majority of the girl really got under my skin for saying racially motivated thing for example one thing that did n't make it on air one of the girl asked me 'do you even know who your father is it blew my mind my parent have been married for year what do you mean because i 'm black and from the inner city you assume i 'm from a single parent household another girl who i ca n't stand to this day said 'you do n't know about how rich people live she assumed because i 'm black and from the inner city that i 'm poor and uneducated and have illegitimate child there were so many thing they assumed about me and did n't even realize how unnerving and upsetting that wa you were the only black woman on your season how did you handle that it wa really hard being on the show knowing i wa the only woman of color you feel like you have this pressure that you have to be on your p and q it wa cumbersome it wa really cumbersome i did n't want to perpetuate stereotype of what people think black woman are i also did n't want to come across a someone who wa portraying herself a the exception and not the rule because being black and from a good family and being college educated or a veteran like jubilee is not the exception that is the norm i believe that is the story of most of u but because that story is not told we can come across like we 're trying to be the exception any advice for jubilee or a woman of color going on the bachelor when i finally lost my cool on the show when i had absolutely had it and flipped my wig and went off on all of these girl that wa the moment i wa so nervous about i came home and i wa so worried and i lamented over it but when i finally let go of that burden of feeling like i had to be perfect and i said what wa on my mind and i let it be told it worked out in my favor looking back now i almost wish that i had n't held my tongue a many time a i did the one time i lost it wa absolutely worth it to jubilee you just have to be yourself you do n't have to carry the torch you do not represent every single black woman in america you represent yourself and you represent yourself very well she is accomplished well spoken beautiful gorgeous she ha every right to be there like everyone else i want her to go farther on the show than i did i made it to the final six and i 'm teamjubilee all the way robyn howard season bachelor sean lowe what wa the bachelor like for you it wa strange to me that sean 's season wa the first to have so many different culture when i first got on the show i thought it would be fun but i 'd leave within the first couple of episode because that 's just the trend so i asked him about it and i truly believe sean just did n't have a specific type i never felt pressured to act a certain way but part of that may have been my upbringing i grew up with all white people until i moved to tennessee i did feel a tiny bit at one point that i wa kept on longer to show that the bachelor wa n't getting rid of black people on purpose what do you think about jubilee i thought jubilee would be gone by now she 's is so opposite from the other girl that it freak them out i remember feeling that way sean would pick certain girl that were not like me and i 'd think 'if sean like that type surely he 'll get rid of me soon and i think that 's what 's happening in the house because jubilee even in bachelor history there 's been no one like her jubilee 's intelligent yes and well spoken yes but you can tell she did n't grow up in a white neighborhood you can tell that she is i mean she 's black she 's urban and it 's so different from the bachelor mold and look at ben he 's so white do i think she 'll make it to the end i do n't do i think she 'll be the next bachelorette i do n't i do n't think it ha to do with the race thing it depends on how far she make it and how the fan respond i do n't personally see it happening were you surprised that producer chose to keep in the 'soccer mom comment and the attack from other woman those comment were pure jealousy and i 'm glad they said it on national tv it made them all look stupid it is weird that producer left it in but at the same time now jubilee get a rose she continues on for some time abc make it seem like they like bringing black people on and after that comment we want to keep them in it 's almost like they 're playing it for their advantage are any of the producer black no no they are n't how should abc solve the bachelor 's diversity problem the fact that a black person ha n't moved up to be the bachelor or the bachelorette is n't abc 's fault it 's always someone from the top three that becomes the next one marquel a former bachelorette contestant would have been the perfect 'in for the bachelor he totally fit the bachelor mold but had they chosen him he would have for sure chosen a white girl and everyone would have gone ballistic on poor marquel guaranteed his top three girl would all be white and then they 'd have to pick the next bachelorette from those three then abc would have done it job by picking a black person once i mean come on we 're not gon na win this not just black people but also everyone who care about the race issue we 're not gon na win this leslie hughes season bachelor sean lowe what wa the bachelor like for you when i got cast i wa super excited i wa like 'oh my god i 'm gon na be the ethnic person and when i got there there were so many of u but being the token black person never even crossed my mind i wa just super excited to be the one who would stand out did the soccer mom and queen bee comment feel like low key racism they did n't strike me a being racist but i 've been in the house and those comment could have been taken from so many other situation and just placed there by producer there is so much editing people think that from watching the whole one hour episode that everything go in order but sometimes the one on one cry could have been four day prior but they need the drama at that moment otherwise it 'd be boring could jubilee win no unfortunately i do n't think so i love how she and ben connect but i just do n't see her going to even the final four could she be the next bachelorette people have already fallen in love with her and she 's got a good back story that 's touching and real she 's a strong woman who ha had to fight for everything she 's ever gotten that 's inspiring to people who watch so if abc is going to make a change jubilee would be the one to do it with and abc ha so many ethnic show and show with so many ethnic people why not take one of the number one abc show and make it more diverse bachelor creator mike fleiss said recently that the next bachelorette would add diversity i wa like 'hello i 'm still single,38388.0

legislator governor mayor national committee member and state committee member across the country these people are democrat and they 're democrat for a reason it 's important to them a party 's nominee to these people need to lead the party'he or she need to be the country 's democrat sander ha never been a democrat which is fine it 's served him well but even a he made the decision to seek the presidency a a democrat he doe n't seem to have made any effort to act like he care about the party he want to lead politico in early january published an interesting news story comparing clinton 's and sander 's fund raising operation clinton raised more than million in and sander million but here wa the key thing in addition to that million clinton bagged for herself she raised another million for democrat around the country the sander figure zero there 's a lot i do n't know about life but i know this democratic office holder keep tab on that sort of thing now maybe some of them did n't want bernie sander at their fund raiser but that would n't have prevented the sander operation from writing check to progressive democrat all over the country a a kind of down payment which apparently did not happen also sander could just say at any time 'you know what i 'm a democrat now he can not technically enroll a one because vermont ha open non party registration he could however simply say it but he ha n't he caucus with the democrat in the senate but that 's just because any senator ha to choose one side or the other partly a a result of this and for other reason sander ha very little democratic support he ha one democratic member of congress keith ellison of minnesota out of and according to the relevant wikipedia page just democratic state legislator across the country actually that 's not across state it 's across only state of the are from new england maine vermont new hampshire connecticut five massachusetts four the vermont number of is particularly interesting because the vermont general assembly which includes both house ha democrat meaning that sander doe n't have even one third of the democrat in his own state maybe sound like a quasi respectable figure to you but there are democratic state legislator in america pdf so is nothing and again the vast majority come from state right in his neighborhood where are the others from according to this list to take stock of some large state and key swing state there 's one from ohio zero from florida zero from virginia zero from colorado zero from new mexico one from nevada two from new york one from illinois and from california pennsylvania and michigan zero zero and zero now my argument is not that endorsement matter that much rather the important part is the likely consequence of this lack of support say it 's late spring and somehow or another sander is charging toward the nomination he 'll pick up some more democratic endorser in safe liberal district in state that he won but here 's what 's going to happen every one of those roughly elected official is going to conduct a poll of his or her district to ascertain whether association with sander help or hurt it 's my guess that for a lot of them'and i would say the substantial majority of them'the answer is going to be 'hurts and even if that 's not the case these legislator will sound out a they inevitably do their top donor and their district ' major employer how many sander enthusiast are going to be found among those two group these legislator will keep their distance from sander they wo n't do the thing that party people normally do for their nominee'go out and make speech share voter information give tip about the district that only they know and so on this will vary from district to district and state to state but the sum and substance will likely be if i 'm right that in a number of important jurisdiction the message of the state and local democratic candidate and party infrastructure to sander will be you 're on your own pal politician think of their own neck first and they 're fearful of the unknown and are overly cautious on matter like this anyway so that 's the first reason having never been a democrat and having even not given them any of his money in this past year sander just is n't going to get much help from democrat the democratic party ha n't nominated someone who wa n't an enrolled member of the party since i believe when it chose newspaperman horace greeley i 'm still checking on gen winfield scott but even if it wa he that 's a long time ago now the second reason i think sander is uniquely vulnerable to scorching foreign policy attack scorching he 'd be subject to stinging attack on domestic policy too but on domestic policy i 'd imagine he can hold his own on economics and health policy and monetary policy whatever you think of his proposal he clearly know the nut and bolt on foreign policy that 's not so clear at all it 's not his lefty past here that i 'm mainly talking about although you 'd better believe that republican would make sure every voter in america knew about that and they 'd lie about it extent to boot but even putting that to the side the issue is his apparent lack of interest over all these year in foreign policy the world is in a pretty parlous state right now so i 'd bet foreign policy will matter more in this election than it usually doe even without a big event in october one factor that greatly benefited bill clinton in is that the cold war had ended and foreign policy wa low on voter ' radar screen sander wo n't be so lucky i could write the ad myself and it would be crushing but i do n't want to give them idea rest assured they 'll think of them on their own and now here 's where my first and second reason relate to each other if a nominee ha strong backing from his party when those attack come the other folk will have his back if he doe n't they wo n't mind you it is not my intent here to scold sander even though many reader will take it that way my intent is just to describe what i think would be the reality when the right started savaging sander over foreign policy and over socialism too of course the bulk of the support system that are usually there for a candidate under attack wo n't be now since i know this column is going to face plenty of rebuttal let me spend two paragraph pre butting myself it 's possible that if sander won the nomination local democrat would by and large just say 'okay he 's our guy and they 'd get behind him i do n't think so for reason stated above but i concede that it 's possible with so much at stake and he still would have the support of the union who these day do most of the get out the vote legwork so it 's possible that a lack of support from democratic candidate in swing and other state wo n't be that severe and wo n't mean a much a i suspect it will mean on foreign policy we see from his debate with clinton what sander 's reply will be i opposed the iraq war and i wa right and second i support barack obama 's foreign policy so i 'll just do more of that who know that might be enough my suspicion is that it will not be it certainly wo n't be against donald trump who also opposed the war in iraq making that issue a wash between the two of them but i suspect that a a general election campaign progress sander will have a harder and harder time leaning on a decision he made year ago even though it wa the right one so that lead to my first stipulation i could be wrong i 've been wrong before and i 'll be wrong again despite what some of you are going to say on twitter and elsewhere i do n't presume to know everything stipulation number two though i admire hillary clinton my argument doe n't have anything to do with her it 's not a brief for clinton she ha a number of flaw she lack the natural pol 's exuberant charisma she ha made error of strategic judgment in her career that make me wonder how effective she 'd be at negotiating with republican or israeli and palestinian and though i do n't think she 's corrupt this stonewalling reflex of hers is just terrible and it 's kind of shocking after all these year that she ca n't see how poorly it ha served her and she come with risk a i wrote monday i doubt she 'll be indicted over the email business but something short of that could still prove politically problematic an fbi report that give republican enough grist to grind through the attack ad mill this fall say so what i 've written here doe n't have to do with her joe biden could be the mainstream candidate or john kerry or joe manchin or claire mccaskill or a democratic governor or anybody and i 'm certain i 'd still think the same thing my feeling that sander could win a general election wa never strong based on the usual stuff i e year old socialist from vermont but recently i 've been reflecting on these two matter his lack of affiliation with the party whose standard he want to bear and his unique vulnerability to attack on foreign policy at a time when those issue are much more in the forefront of voter ' mind than usual a i 've written before current general election head to head polling is meaningless since conservative have n't yet spent a dollar attacking him if he 's the nominee they 're going to spend at least five hundred million of them doing that and some democrat more likely a lot of democrat are going to run away from him i ca n't see how that end well,92585.0

weighs the pro and con of animal cloning the legal world is doing the same in the u s cloning of farm animal is currently legal'with the federal drug administration declaring that these clone are a 'safe a the food we eat every day the same is true in china but not everywhere in august the european union edged closer to outlawing the practice all together with the eu parliament voting in favor

the best of it film actor and filmmakers'the foreplay for it biggest gaudiest award show instead it served a further evidence that hollywood is still very much invested in highlighting and celebrating only the whitest of it content and creator with zero out of twenty nomination going to non white actor on oscar night the only brown people onstage will be presenter the weeknd and host chris rock and for the second year in a row social medium responded with a justified roast of the academy award with the oscarssowhite hashtag even rock could n't resist ribbing the oscar calling the show the 'white bet award in a promo tweet in the mid s when black actor like jamie foxx morgan freeman and forest whitaker were taking home statue i thought that thing were taking a turn for the better i wa

henson don cheadle viola davis terrence howard jennifer hudson will smith gabourey sidibe quvenzhan wallis and the late ruby dee had all gotten oscar nod or win in the decade between and but the last two year have felt like an alarming regression and frankly the academy ha built up almost a century of bad will regarding it acknowledgement of black cinematic achievement it would be easy to dismiss the criticism against the academy award a illegitimate'after all it 's only been two year since year a slave took home best picture'a movie with a black director that also landed a best actor nomination for ejiofor and a best supporting actress win for lupita nyong'o but it 's important to take note of all that ha happened culturally in those two year in the wake of the killing of mike brown and eric garner 'black life matter became the mantra of a generation at the same time several filmmaker and film have emerged that tapped into that very spirit from the civil right epic selma to the urban rage reflected in straight outta compton these are urgent and timely film yet the academy doe n't seem to hold them in very high esteem andrew gruttadaro of complex posited that while the academy is clearly at fault for it lack of diversity 'the truth is that this time around the academy did n't really mess up in any egregious way by leaving black actor creator off the ballot this year no black people deserved a nomination his position is condescending and dishonest we ca n't presume that every single white nominee that 's ever gotten an oscar nod met some mythical criterion other than the taste of the academy and we should n't assume that those taste are n't wholly informed by aesthetic biases'which includes race every year commentator and fan voice criticism for movie and performance that they felt were n't deserving of academy attention and gruttadaro should n't pretend that the major black film of were uniquely and obviously le qualified wa fatal attraction such a remarkable film it wa nominated for best picture wa driving miss daisy more indelible to than do the right thing in a world where crash dishonest melodrama delivered via pretentious morality tale and birdman visual gimmickry ca n't mask disengaged storytelling can win best picture we ca n't really justify beast of no nation or creed not getting a nod a merely evidence of 'high standard all of the oscar nominee a of the academy wa percent white percent male and an average of year old do year old white men readily identify with a gangsta rap biopic set in the late ' s do they see it in the same grandiose fashion a they would say a film about a ' s country star or ill fated ' s rock 'n ' roller do the 'fucks and 'niggas in the soundtrack make it hard for them to view it in the same light a a movie about steve job or brian wilson maybe they can only relate to black struggle when it 's couched in a package they find acceptable like a biopic about a soul singer they grew up listening to or a period piece about an embattled slave fighting for his freedom maybe old white men do n't know shit about new black cinema ryan coogler 's creed transcended it tag a a reboot of the rocky franchise to become both a critical and commercial hit it 's success is a testament to coogler 's visionary approach'the movie is part homage part bold new chapter'and star michael b jordan 's onscreen charisma but when the academy announced it nominee the young black director and his young black star were ignored the film 's lone nomination went to franchise mainstay sylvester stallone who is white coogler 's directing wa n't 'good enough to merit a nomination jordan 's acting wa n't 'good enough either'but stallone 's obviously wa if sylvester stallone happens to take home an oscar this year it will be a black director 's film that landed him the award the creed conundrum is even more disturbing when you compare it to the original rocky while the two film are fairly even in quality rocky received oscar nomination taking home the gold for best picture and best director so what wa it about creed that led to it snubbing certainly not that it 's a reboot considering mad max fury road received oscar nomination what could it possibly be it 's true that major studio are n't greenlighting enough black stories'that much is obvious but recognizing that doe n't mean undervaluing the content that ha been produced selma straight outta compton beast of no nation creed concussion fruitvale station the butler dope and girlhood are n't uniformly inferior to every white film that 's been nominated for an academy award in the last three year suggesting such only mean that we still operate from the culturally skewed position that black creativity must be regarded a unequivocally excellent just to occupy the same space a white work that is only very good'if that looking at you the danish girl and the industry need to examine what an oscar mean for black actor and actress lupita nyong'o took home the best supporting actress academy award in since then she 's appeared in a supporting role in a forgettable liam neeson action film non stop and voiced an elderly cgi alien in star war the force awakens meanwhile jennifer lawrence after receiving a best actress nomination in winter 's bone in immediately landed high profile star making role in franchise film like x men and the hunger games'on the way to more oscar bait opportunity starring in david o russell dramedies since halle berry jennifer hudson mo'nique and octavia spencer have all won academy award but only berry'who is half white'was afforded the kind of a list post oscar visibility enjoyed by most white actress who either win the award or get nominated actress like nicole kidman charlize theron hillary swank reese witherspoon sandra bullock and natalie portman have been fixture on the a list'many did n't need oscar win to get there but parlayed those win into high profile project later the same go for many winner of the best supporting actress oscar'stars like anne hathaway penelope cruz and renee zellweger the only winner who do n't seem to routinely land on hollywood 's a list are black woman not named 'halle or 'whoopi there are those who look at thing like the blindingly white oscar nominee list and decide that it 's pointless for black people to constantly call out award show 'start your own they say 'stop begging for acceptance and validation but black people already have our own award show and black people do n't really care about white validation but when black actor director and writer have to seek work from major studio and production house when said studio and production house make billion off of telling black story to white audience there damn well had better be recognition for black creativity and content black art can not be whitewashed out of american society and culture a a people we build our own and we support our own'contrary to what some may believe but while we continue to build and support blackness we ca n't allow mainstream platform to mute our contribution when disseminating content to the world at the th academy award in eddie murphy addressed the industry 's oscar bias 'when they came to me and they said they wanted me to present the award for best picture'my first reaction wa to say 'no i 'm not going ' murphy revealed 'because they have n't recognized black people in the motion picture industry 'i 'll probably never win an oscar for saying this but what the hey i got ta say it murphy continued before wise cracking 'actually i might not get in trouble because the way it 's been going every twenty year is when we get one so we ai n't due until about so by that time this will have all blown over 'i came down here to give the award but i feel we have to be recognized a a people i just want you to know that black people will not ride the caboose of society or bring up the rear anymore maybe the academy did n't hear eddie in coogler also addressed hollywood diversity during his speech at the los angeles film critic award this last weekend more than validation or acceptance the fight is still for opportunity 'find the diversity find the voice that are in those place you might not think to look because it will be amazing to see the next generation he said 'maybe more of them will look like sue kroll president of warner bros maybe more of them will look like me and mike jordan maybe more of them will look like film critic justin chang that seems to make the most sense that seems to be best for everyone sooner or later we have to start asking ourselves why hollywood continues to turn a deaf ear,50815.0

jose wa a big success but how did lambert go from running one boutique hotel to forming a multi propertied hotel group 'i realized that i really liked to design i liked the programming i liked the actual process of creating a hotel and i did n't necessarily want to be the person at the front desk lambert say in she partnered with greg marchbanks and bill gernstein to form the bunkhouse group they became ceo and cfo respectively and freed her up to focus on the creative side of the business lambert drive the design process of all of the bunkhouse group property and her philosophy is closely tied to place like one of her favorite architecture writer christopher alexander you can see this in the trace of the old south congress street at the hotel san jose it can be seen in the artistic desert chic dig of el cosmico in marfa and soon in a new hotel being built in austin the magdalena which take it design inspiration from the old austin lake house vibe when lambert embarks on a new hotel project she come up with the story of the place and then go about pulling together aspect of the design that encompass all of the sens she work with a music designer to create a soundtrack for each hotel and chooses a scent and a color that embody the property 's personality take the hotel saint cecilia the hotel 's playlist which do n't fear is not the only thing streamed on the premise'just the inspiration includes a selection of new and old music that recall the rock 'n roll psychedelic and folk tune of through think syd barrett brigitte bardot courtney barnett and yo la tengo music is so important to lambert she considers it 'a defining part of our life and it influence u in every twist and turn and the community that surround her hotel that she even host music festival at two of the properties'south by san jose at the hotel san jose a free five day extravaganza that occurs at the same time a austin 's annual sxsw festival and the trans pecos festival of music love at el cosmico this special bunkhouse sauce of distinct and innovative design combined with hotel 'happenings others include pop up cocktail event for guest and community focused event like chili cook offs and dog parade many of which benefit local charity will only be bolstered a the bunkhouse group jump into bed'pun intended'with the standard hotel with the support and expertise of a larger hotel group especially in thing like new technology lambert say they will have 'new opportunity to expand in a couple of way that we 're just now exploring lambert say they will continue to work within the framework of what they do best 'projects hotel that are in interesting place that have a lot of culture that make sense for u to kind of nestle into whether it 's new orleans or nashville or memphis or portland 'the hotel that i feel are most kind of whole and natural and beautiful have a sense of self and a sense of place it doe n't get re done every seven year or re fit they are just part of a neighborhood and a community and they have a self assuredness and just get better over time lambert say 'it seemed like instead of trying to really design something if you listen to the place and make something a part of a place it becomes easier'at least it doe for me,16539.0

of what 's available there 's mao zedong and the red guard there 's xi jinping 's internal dialog and of course there 's princeling killing the nation such book anathema to the mainland government are published in hong kong and taiwan and churned out at breakneck speed if a 'tiger 'a high level public official'is snagged in president xi jinping 's anti corruption campaign expect to see a slew of book about the unfortunate man 's private and personal life within a week or two a lot of it might be hearsay or gossip but that doe n't stop reader from snapping up the volume for the bookseller and publisher it 's a risky business a some have learned recently they can disappear suddenly and without explanation on december one of the shareholder of the causeway bay book bookstore named lee bo lost contact with his wife earlier that day mr lee received a phone call for a large order and went to his warehouse to pick up the book so he could deliver them to the client personally lee 's wife finally received a phone call that evening the caller id showed a phone number registered in shenzhen lee said to her'in putonghua instead of cantonese which they normally use'that he wa in shenzhen 'assisting in an investigation and he would n't be back soon he also told her to be careful to take care of their son and not to publicize the incident rthk the public radio broadcaster in hong kong reported the immigration department had no record of lee bo leaving hong kong for mainland china two day later lee wa still missing so his wife went to the police in hong kong for help they told her that lee is a 'normal person so he is free to cross the border between hong kong and mainland china a he plea and there is no reason to mount an investigation last october another shareholder and three employee who work for lee 's bookstore disappeared under the same murky circumstance one of the men a swedish national named gui minhai wa in thailand when he apparently fell off the face of the earth at the time mr lee had told bbc news 'i suspect all of them were detained four people went missing at the same time chinese official still have not confirmed or denied that the four men are in custody in mainland china these disappearance are n't limited to bookseller or publisher in hong kong the same kind of tactic have been used against chinese activist human right lawyer government official about to be purged business tycoon and high finance type who were blamed for last year 's stock market crash since lee bo is a british national the united kingdom 's foreign office ha expressed deep concern about his disappearance during a visit in beijing two week ago british foreign secretary philip hammond said beijing would be guilty of an 'egregious breach if it is ever confirmed that chinese security force were involved in the abduction of lee the evening before hammond 's statement chinese foreign minister wang yi ignored lee bo 's british citizenship and said the bookseller is 'first and foremost a chinese citizen there are other serious legal ramification under the 'one country two system formula that establishes the sovereign relationship between china and hong kong the former british colony is guaranteed a high degree of autonomy in it judicial and political affair in particular mainland chinese police officer are not allowed to operate in hong kong removing hong kong 's bookseller and publisher from public sight is part of a larger campaign waged by beijing to plug the criticism coming from the southeastern city hong kong enjoys a greater freedom of speech than mainland china and critic of the chinese communist party 's action have in the past been able to express their concern without a huge fear of retaliation but thing have changed in recent year kevin lau the mild mannered former chief editor of hong kong 's ming pao a chinese language newspaper with a reputation for engaging in aggressive investigative reporting wa attacked by two men in february he suffered stab wound to his back and leg le than a year before lau wa attacked chen ping the publisher of a magazine that is banned in mainland china wa beaten by two men wielding baton in a separate incident masked men threatened the worker of next medium group and burned copy of apple daily a popular anti ccp tabloid in hong kong eleven people all with link to triad gang were arrested in connection with lau 's attack with the two main suspect detained in guangdong province which is next door to hong kong the south china morning post cited a source close to guangdong 's public security bureau and said each attacker wa paid u to carry out the assault on lau however it wa never made clear who paid the pair on sunday night state run cctv broadcast a statement by gui minhai the man who had disappeared from thailand in october 'for so many year i wa abroad i wa in constant fear and discomfort and often had nightmare gui said 'i also dreamed that i would return home and see my relative in his confession gui said he wa involved in a drunken hit and run in ningbo a city on the eastern coast of china twelve year ago the collision killed a university student a report by xinhua claim he used fake identification document to leave china after the incident and eventually obtained swedish citizenship which gui addressed in his statement 'even though i have swedish citizenship i truly feel i am chinese and my root are still in china gui said 'i hope the swedish authority can respect my personal choice respect my right and privacy and let me solve my problem on my own the report end on an ominous note gui minhai is suspected of other crime we are told other individual involved in the case are assisting with the investigation after gui 's appearance on cctv the guangdong provincial public security department acknowledged that they have lee bo in custody what is evident by observing the series of attack and disappearance targeting anti ccp publisher is that beijing is touchy about the printed word but the ccp 's freakishly tight control of all form of medium particularly in print and online doe n't simply limit the consumption of information it hinders economic development chinese tech company are unable to use the same tool that are used by their counterpart in every other part of the world scholar need to navigate nagging obstacle to conduct research and generate research paper student do not have access to the same wealth of information available to anyone else particularly the modern history of their own nation in major mainland chinese city propaganda banner poster and mural blanket downtown area certain word are tossed around the most prosperity democracy civilization harmony freedom equality justice rule of law patriotism dedication integrity kindness yet dissent or even mere disagreement with the ccp 's policy is enough to land one in sticky extra legal situation involving threat issued by state sanctioned agent or crippling physical assault committed by hired hand it 's not a new idea that the gentle public face of beijing hide an iron fist but hongkongers are seeing a gradual but incessant creep of the ccp 's thuggish tactic and influence in the city with no ability to riposte,4476.0

the first episode of the show 's th season will debut for the first time on hbo the pay cable network more famous for chopping off head and showing booby than it is for molding young mind before airing on it former home pb nine month later the change'as all change do'angered some sesame street is an institution generation of people hold near and dear and it founding mission back in wa to entertainingly educate the underprivileged hence it outer borough aesthetic relocating from pb a network made possible a anyone who watch can recite in unison 'by viewer like you to hbo a subscription network with one of the most affluent demographic in the industry seems blasphemous to those who grew up on the street because the new hbo version doe have some change the day are sunnier the air is

workshop had been facing a harsh truth their aging cultural touchstone while maybe not a popular a it once wa wa certainly not a dominant in the child 's television space it wa an expensive show and it wa losing money competition from nickelodeon and the disney channel had been a threat to it stake in the genre for decade but with more network popping up streaming service like amazon and netflix investing heavily in child 's content and a simple youtube search sufficing to find engaging content for your kid too much traffic had begun deterring trip to sesame street the day of tickle me elmo were also long gone revenue for licensing had been plummeting a had dvd and toy sale sentimentality on behalf of parent wa one thing kid actually watching wa another making the show is n't cheap even on sesame street the rent is too damn high something that mitt romney infamously reminded u four year ago when he made evicting big bird part of his campaign platform 'i 'm sorry jim i 'm gon na stop

oscar'will feature prominently in main storyline the set got a face lift with exec dismayed by the grittiness those pop culture parody of show like game of throne and mad men that hip culture website love so much will be sparser in line with a mission to make the show more focused on kid and not their parent not many four year old were in on the joke of frank underwolf in house of brick the biggest change though is the reduction of each episode from an hour to minute a more digestible time for kid in today 's ever distracted world and you know what it 's a good call in fact saturday 's first two episode in this five year hbo deal are pretty great when we re meet the character abby is having a sleepover at elmo 's a new bilingual human character nina played by suki lopez is introduced she work at the laundromat the bike shop and babysits got ta work three job to afford that hbo bill nina educates elmo and abby about bedtime routine it 's cute it 's informative it will

perhaps kiss off'to all the behind the scene grouchiness that ha followed sesame street 's hbo move a show a hallowed and a much a part of our life a sesame street'for so many people big bird and elmo were not just fun friend to visit but surrogate parent the count a teacher'fosters strong passion and not just for viewer but for the creatives who have been sweeping the cloud away for all these year chief among them is joey mazzarino sesame street 's former head writer who parted way with the show in september over the hbo move 'after almost a year of battling for what i believe is the heart and soul of the show i lost the war he wrote on facebook while not tantamount to big bird flying the coop it 's an indication that not everything wa sunny on the street after the hbo bailout for a sense

nickelodeon who wa hired by sesame in to reorganize operation and cut cost wore to the annual halloween party he dressed a the count it 's easy to understand why mazzarino the show 's creatives or even big bird might find their feather ruffled over this move viewer too hbo is n't free the parent television council even launched a campaign after the announcement for the network to make the episode available for free both keeping in line with the show 's history of educating underprivileged children'the family that ca n't afford a year hbo subscription'and avoiding any moral complication that would arise from subscribing to a network known for explicit content in order to gain access to a child 's show but a for mazzarino 's insinuation that any heart or soul is missing from the show we know and love i 'm not sure that 's true and for what it 's worth i 'm a tv writer and a such have watched dozen of pilot and premiere for new and returning winter show in recent week nothing

kind of triangle with their hand or both and what 's up with all the occult imagery in video for jay z 's 'on to the next one and kanye 's 'power is it just because it look cool and mysterious the conspiracy minded say there 's something more sinister to it this is evidence they say of a vast nefarious secret society'the illuminati'and it plan to institute a new world order like all of the best conspiracy theory this one begin with an acorn of truth and end up in a forest of speculation there really wa a secret society called the illuminati and it really did aspire to transform society by surreptitiously placing it member in position of influence the group wa formed in by a young bavarian professor named adam weishaupt historian john robert described weishaupt a equal part lofty idealist and petty narcissist on one hand weishaupt really did want to bring about a le religious more egalitarian rational society on the other he also really wanted to be head honcho of a spooky secret boy 's club his illuminati wa designed to scratch both itch he developed a convoluted hierarchy for his order gave recruit codenames taking spartacus for himself and had them infiltrate local branch of the freemason and pick off their member over nine year the illuminati grew to a few hundred member but weishaupt 's personality rubbed some member the wrong way and they spilled the bean rumor about the secret society spread getting embellished along the way into ever more sordid allegation by the mid s it had caught the attention of the bavarian government which put an end to weishaupt 's fun by banning illuminati activity under penalty of death weishaupt fled and gave up the secret shenanigan there 's no evidence that he or anyone else anyone tried to keep the organization going that likely would have been the last anyone heard of the illuminati if not for the french revolution which kicked off a few year later searching for an explanation for the unprecedented social upheaval taking place around them some european author suggested the illuminati wa pulling the string sensational theory spread around europe and america alleging that the illuminati wa still operating in secret more powerful than ever and that it aimed to overthrow all the government of europe how did the illuminati go from orchestrating revolution to promoting pop star the panic of the late th century died down quickly for almost year the illuminati took a back seat in conspiracists ' imagination to other group like freemason jew catholic communist business tycoon and government bureaucrat until it wa revived by mid ' s hip hop 'illuminati want my mind soul and my body secret society trying to keep they eye on me rapped mobb deep 's prodigy in a remix of ll cool j 's 'i shot ya the same year cell therapy by goodie mob painted a bleak picture of what society will look like under the coming new world order invoking conspiracy trope like martial law

control society that 's why society is outta control thirty third and one third i heard the illuminated one over the next year or so ra ka the wu tang clan and dr dre all mentioned the illuminati or the new world order canibus went even further down the rabbit hole with his single 'channel zero which begin by claiming the government is covering up visit by super intelligent alien and explains that roswell cattle mutilation and even astronomer carl sagan were part of the plot after a while hip hop 's paranoia turned in on itself rumor emerged suggesting that certain artist might be part of the conspiracy the first to come under suspicion wa jay z his immense success the conspiracists theorized could n't have been earned through talent hard work or luck he must have sold his soul to the illuminati one of the first and most vocal proponent of this theory wa none other than prodigy jay had sampled prodigy 's line about the illuminati on 'd'evils from his debut album but by prodigy wa convinced in a letter penned from prison he accused jay z himself of being a puppet'wittingly or unwittingly'of the illuminati writing 'j z conceals the truth from the black community and the world and promotes the lifestyle of the beast instead the accusation spread far and wide first to kanye west and rhianna when they appeared in the video for 'run this town with jay'which had a distinctly

'probably ' other artist see the conspiracy theory a pointless'or worse a misdirection talib kweli 's single 'the wormhole artfully dissects the history philosophy psychology and politics of

bogeyman it 's legislator that are right now passing legislation that disenfranchises so many people kanye west addressed the idea in an interview with paper magazine 'if there wa actually an illuminati it would be more like the energy companies'not celebrity that gave their life to music and who are pinpointed a decoy for people who really run the world i 'm tired of people pinpointing musician a the illuminati that 's ridiculous we do n't run anything we 're celebrity we 're the face of brand we have to compromise what we say in lyric so we do n't lose money on a contract it might seem strange that hip hop would give credence to illuminati theories'especially given that the other main purveyor of new world order doom saying http www thedailybeast com article russia today ha an illuminati correspondent really html tend to be found on the political far right the idea of the new world order gained prominence in the early ' s when george h w bush used the term in a speech about restructuring global politics in the wake of the cold war some anti government survivalist took it a a thinly veiled announcement of a coming totalitarian world government and some fundamentalist christian saw it a a harbinger of the apocalypse but it 's not surprising that idea about conspiracy would make their way into hip hop a questlove of the root explained in an essay for vulture hip hop 'originally evolved to paint portrait of real people and handle real problem at close range the music offered a platform to give voice to issue that were largely ignored by the mainstream medium a chuck d of public enemy put it 'rap is black america 's tv station it give a whole perspective of what exists and what black life is about from grandmaster flash 's groundbreaking single 'the method onward there ha been a strain of hip hop that address issue like drug use poverty violence and institutionalized racism and a activist marc lamont hill put it one way to rationalize being disenfranchised is to say 'they the powerful do n't play fair the game is rigged from allegation that aid wa created by the government to the idea that certain brand of cigarette soda and fast food are laced with additive designed to sterilize black men conspiracy theory have long circulated within black community given the history of very real institutional racism in the u s 'including covert surveillance of civil right leader the infamous tuskegee study and tension over policing and the criminal justice system'it 's not hard to see why these idea would resonate cornell university prof travis gosa pointed out in a paper that even if these conspiracy theory are n't true they can be rhetorically useful they give voice'if in a deliberately hyperbolic way'to legitimate concern about racial inequality and they are provocative by design the idea that the illuminati is manipulating the music industry conveys the message that listener should n't be unreflective consumer of pop culture and should n't passively accept dominant narrative and expert wisdom of course while music might be intended to inform or incite it is also designed to entertain and a a glance at bestseller list can attest conspiracy sell the search for hidden meaning and coded symbol add another level on which a product can be enjoyed which might explain why jay z keep putting occult reference in his song and video even while he explicitly denies being part of the illuminati 'great rap should have all kind of unresolved layer that you do n't necessarily figure out the first time you listen to it instead it plant dissonance in your head jay wrote in his book decoded and what better way to plant dissonance than canny use of subversive imagery hip hop wa predicated on sampling and remixing older idea into something new and relevant and illuminati myth and symbol can be sampled the same way a drumbeat can then again there might be a more pragmatic reason why hip hop latched on to the idea of the illuminati a rakaa iriscience of the trio dilated people pointed out in a interview with hiphopdx com 'there were a lot of organization that existed that one the illuminati just happened to rhyme with body party naughty and a lot of other thing it sound cooler than some of the other one do bandmate dj babu agreed 'yeah templar doe n't sound cool illuminati is way tighter,54928.0

kim khlo kourtney kendall and kylie became household name 'i would tell the girl that every time they were feeling insecure she said 'i remember kimberly one day came downstairs year and year ago and said 'i could n't sleep last night i wa so nervous ' i said 'why ' she said 'i have to do an on camera appearance and i have to talk right to a camera'i 've never done that before ' 'it is very weird

will be much easier so will the next time after that and then you go to the next one live in that uncomfortable zone the former olympian and reality tv star know a thing or two about embracing

comfort zone ' so that 's what we did and it turned out to be beautiful taylor revealed that even exposing herself to the scrutiny of transphobic stranger during the shoot wa daunting 'i had just started my transition she explained 'sometimes people can say mean thing when they figure out that you 're transgender it 's really hurtful some of the thing that people can say so i did have to come out of my comfort zone just to film heading into after a breakthrough year in trans awareness jenner say the lgbt movement still ha a lot of work to do 'i 'm very happy for where this community is at

what little hope remains is weary and torn abandoned like the row of dilapidated uninhabitable home and weed strewn lot that dot the avenue drowning in water too toxic to drink the story of flint michigan not unlike other former smoke stack city that dot the upper midwest is almost too painful to tell the latest revelation involving a water supply tainted with lead feel like a cruel joke being played on people who can least afford the laugh with thousand of child at risk the justice department ha announced an investigation into who knew the water wa toxic and when michigan 's attorney general ha launched a separate inquiry ultimately what happened in flint may not be a criminal matter but there is nothing moral about what happened there the once booming center of industry ha lost half of it population in recent decade and is now one of the poorest city in the nation today nearly percent of flint resident live below the poverty line what remains of flint is percent black and nearly percent white'all too poor to get up and leave blink and you could be standing in gary indiana east st louis illinois or camden new jersey watching a similar tragedy unfold factory close the middle class take flight to the suburb to build better school and tend to pristine lawn they are among america 's forgotten cities'wracked with pervasive poverty and violent crime'populated by a forgotten people mostly black and brown they have little voice over their own destiny there are no finely suited washington lobbyist pressing their interest presidential candidate rarely come to place like these and they almost never make the national news unless something really bad happens there are so many problem so many complication in flint that it is difficult for any one issue to command it collective attention back in april an unelected manager appointed by the state to make flint solvent decided the city could save money by drawing water from the flint river instead of lake huron local resident thought it wa a joke given the ugliness thought to be swimming in that river it would have taken a five minute test to prove the river water unsafe city leader who were then weighing le expensive option knew a early a that water from the flint river would need treatment with an anticorrosive agent before it would be drinkable in the end the governor say he had no choice since detroit 'kicked flint off it lake huron system the fact is that never happened detroit asked for a rate change and instead of negotiating gov rick snyder 's appointee opted out they were more concerned about saving money than saving life to make matter worse the michigan state department of environmental quality decided a day wa too much to pay for an anticorrosive additive that could appropriately treat the water consequently the iron pipe eroded ' turning the water brown'and lead began seeping into the water supply state and federal official knew there wa a problem with brown water pumping out of kitchen faucet and fire hydrant there wa no way to hide their error state agency reportedly used testing methodology that would hide the real level of pollutants'including flushing residential system before testing they cheated to make it appear that the water wa in compliance knowing that skewed test were used ultimately it took month and a mother named leanne walter who would n't give up chicago based epa regulation manager a local physician an investigative journalist and a class action lawsuit to force the state to do the right thing by then the damage wa done'to walter 's four year old twin and the at least five percent of flint child who have tested positive the effect of lead poisoning especially on child are well known and there are no safe level for human consumption lead poisoning can have devastating effect on child causing convulsion hyper irritability and neurological damage that last into adulthood study show linkage to juvenile delinquency adhd and a decrement in iq performance in fact there is so much lead in the blood of flint 's child that the state ha called a state of emergency the scourge is irreversible this is a manmade disaster that will have catastrophic generational effect the flint water crisis is just the latest among a whole host of serious environmental issue surrounding the city when general motor and supplier pulled up stake and left for greener pasture they left unconscionable level of contamination behind the same is true in other rust belt city a community 's wealth is not only tied to job and education but also to health

that mean forcing chemical manufacturer automaker steel mill and others to clean up their own mess they should be forced to fill the hole they dug it is hard to believe that no one knew what wa in that river it is hard to believe that no one thought to test the water and the system through which it would travel for potential problem and the governor ' explanation about why the change wa made a

spring reached damascus in the spring of he say he wa supportive but unable to join 'i 'm angry that i could n't participate he told me magrhebi wa in the opposite position not serving in the military and a vocal supporter of the revolt he still cite the hope of those early day of protest a inspiration for many of his lyric a revolution turned into a bloody multifaceted regional proxy war the band left for lebanon one by one they fled bloodshed dodging conscription or deserting their army post bazz and qassar fled the country in within day of getting their call up notice maghrebi left around the same time darwish wa serving in a non combat unit so tried at first to keep his head down and sit out the war in a radio bunker however in he got transfer order to a combat unit and deserted for six nerve racking month he hid out in damascus until the fsa wa able to get him out of the city and guide him on foot through the mountain to lebanon arriving in beirut without any document and only the clothes on his back darwish found a new life full of harassment and restriction in a country that still doe n't officially recognize it over one million syrian a refugee it wa in this context that khebez dawle wa launched and carved out a place for itself in the city 's vibrant nightlife 'at first i wa happy to escape and felt free but after that i started to face problem darwish say sitting on the floor of a friend 's istanbul apartment surrounded by keyboard and mixer 'i got arrested by the lebanese authority because i wa illegal and did n't have paper he say then he wa arrested a second time trying to leave the country on a fake syrian passport the pro assad lebanese shia organization hezbollah and amal suspecting he wa a deserter targeted him for questioning on several occasion the rest of the band reached berlin in october and are now navigating the immigration process while settling into a new life they are already planning an official european tour for spring part of which will have them reverse their migration path from central europe back to the balkan and then onto greece maghrebi contends that while they were originally planning on staying in vienna the band wa drawn to berlin 's internationalism vibrant art scene and openness to refugee 'in berlin i feel like a global citizen like i can express my fear and hope and art he said on skype from the german capital shortly after the paris terrorist attack despite the welcoming cosmopolitan arrival he say he 's felt an increase in hostility directed at syrian since the massacre in france even though none of the known attacker wa in fact syrian for maghrebi like many refugee the post paris attack climate ha not only created fear of a backlash alongside horror at the carnage that isi unleashed but it also conjured up the familiar feeling that the war can not be escaped 'i do n't want to see a piece of what 's happened in syria happen in europe maghrebi said meanwhile darwish remains stranded in turkey a the rough winter water of the mediterranean make crossing to greece now especially dangerous he worry that the spiking hostility towards refugee since the attack and new european union agreement with turkey to stop asylum seeker from leaving for greece will prevent him from rejoining the band the un refugee agency reported from lesbos this week that 'despite strong wind and choppy wave on dec dozen of family continued to land they were coming in 'overstuffed inflatable boat designed to carry just eight people some carried more than darwish ha applied for a eu visa but the band ha tried and been denied them in the past despite invitation to play at european festival he is torn between the stress of making it to germany for the tour and waiting for a calmer spring sea so living in limbo and distracting himself with solo project he prepares for the likely clandestine journey of what the band hope is the final stage of it rock and refuge tour,4351.0

not so famous'acknowledging how much the legendary rocker 's music and creativity have impacted them over the course of his six decade career bowie 's enigmatic malleable persona make him endlessly fascinating a video clip of bowie 's infamous exchange with mtv vj mark goodman ha gone viral in the wake of his death during the interview bowie revers role and begin quizzing goodman about mtv 's lack of support for black artist 'there seem to be a lot of black artist making very good video that i 'm surprised are n't being used on mtv goodman defended it a 'narrowcasting 'the few black artist one doe see are on around in the morning until about six bowie added 'i 'll say that over the last couple of week these thing have been changing but it 's a slow process goodman go on to try and defend the network but only seems to defend mtv 's racism a an extension of the racism of it perceived audience 'we grew up in an era when the isley brother mean something to me'or the spinners'but what doe it mean to a year old 'i can tell you what the isley brother or marvin gaye mean to a black year old and surely he 's part of america a well bowie shot back it would be easy to overpraise a white superstar for acknowledging racism on any level we tend to become enamored with those in position of societal privilege who both recognize that privilege and are willing to challenge systematic oppression a man who is vocal on woman 's right issue gain loud applause for saying what woman consistently say for themselves straight people superficially 'standing up for the lgbtq community become a lauded a the most battle scared gay activist and white people who call out white supremacy can be heralded a 'progressive just because the system ignored the protest of the black people it routinely oppresses but bowie 's journey a it pertains to race is intriguing because it take so many confounding twist and turn most notably how doe one go from immersing their music in the funk and soul sound of young american to indulging a nazism and fascism fetish to speaking out consistently about race and racism it may be the most fascinating element in bowie 's famously ever changing persona and outlook following the breakthrough of his ziggy stardust album and the success of aladdin sane bowie retreated from the glam rock he 'd helped popularize into american r b with help from funk guitarist carlos alomar and vocalist songwriter luther vandross bowie dove headfirst into funk and philly soul'or his closest approximation of it 'i started making little vocal arrangement and showing them to alomar 's wife and famed session vocalist robin vandross recalled in a interview with black collegian 'i did n't know that bowie had overheard all this he wa sitting right behind me at the board and he said 'that 's a great idea put that down ' so i put it down and next thing you know one thing led to another and i wa doing the vocal arrangement for the whole album i wrote one of the song on the album bowie overheard it and said 'i want to record that do you mind ' 'bowie made me go out and do an opening forty five minute act for him every night with my own material vandross shared 'i remember the first night i went onstage and did my thing some of the people it wa scattered were shouting 'bowie bowie ' that wa very disconcerting to me that night bowie said 'please later for these people later for them you go out there and get your art together ' 's young american gave bowie his first big pop hit in america with the title track and the john lennon assisted no hit 'fame but by the time of it release he 'd been living in new york city and begun session for station to station the lead single 'golden year continued in bowie 's funk vein and he performed it and 'fame during a famous appearance on soul train that year'later revealing he wa intoxicated the entire time having gotten drunk to calm his nerve despite the groove on 'golden year and the soul train appearance the station to station album wa the beginning of bowie transition into his next phase musically and his next stranger persona he wa starting to embrace more quasi european sound like krautrock and colder more detached synth driven music but his addiction were sending him to a dark place it ha been well documented that bowie wa intrigued by nazi imagery in the coke addled period following young american he 'd been introduced to german history by british writer christopher isherwood whom bowie had met after a concert in los angeles in it wa two year before he actually moved to west berlin'following an intensely dark period where he created his cold 'thin white duke persona wa terribly addicted to cocaine flirting with the occult surviving on red pepper and milk and making bizarre claim in the press about hitler and how fascism could help britain he wa detained in poland for traveling with nazi paraphernalia and in came the infamous 'victoria station incident when bowie wa pictured giving what appeared to be a nazi salute'a claim he consistently denied his time in west berlin seemed to turn him against fascism his mythologizing of the city had been tied to his romanticizing of 'old europe born of disillusionment with america and with standard rock music bowie later blamed his nazi fetish on drug and 'crazed quote and it could be argued that he wa more into the indulgence of fascism than the ideology but his image change coincided with the rise of extreme right hate group in england and both he and eric clapton who delivered a notoriously racist rant at a birmingham concert in the same year a bowie 's infamous salute were name dropped by those who 'd organized rock against racism a reason for the organization 's inception but bowie a racist seemed to contradict so much of who he 'd been previously and where he would go in the coming decade after all from bowie wa involved romantically with motown singer ava cherry aka black barbarella some of his problematic behavior wa blamed on drug some on the 'thin white duke persona he 'd adopted during his final day in berlin the singer had seen his name sprayed on a wall some have suggested it wa the berlin wall but that wa n't confirmed and the last two letter were framed in a swastika it disturbed him to see himself linked so explicitly to nazism and any appeal the imagery had became troubling dabbling in the darkness wa not going to be his approach going forward and reference to fascism and the occult disappeared from his persona altogether by bowie had dropped the duke image and referred to it a 'a nasty character for me by the early s he wa clean divorced from his first wife angie and healthy he wa in new york working with superproducer nile rodgers on what would become a huge crossover album for his career let 's dance wa bowie 'going black again and he sounded more comfortable than he had on the somewhat contrived young american from seven year earlier bowie wa at his most avant garde during the rise of disco and the disdain for that genre expressed by many rock fan wa rooted in the kind of racial prejudice hinted at in the goodman interview but bowie the rock veteran tapped the producer who 'd made the best record of the disco era to produce his new album long after disco 's heyday 'at the time in my life that i wa persona non grata when no one would work with me because of 'disco suck ' rodgers recalled shortly after bowie 's death 'this guy who wa considered one of the great innovative rocker picked a disco guy who nobody wanted to work with to collaborate with and we wound up making the biggest record of his career 'david listened to me i remember once explaining to him how for me a a black artist it wa very difficult for me to get hit because we had fewer radio station to expose our music so to get attention a technique of mine wa i always started my song with the chorus 'ahhh freak out ' and 'we are family ' and then of course there 's 'let 's dance ' so when david gave me this award'for the archive of contemporary music'he said 'to my friend nile rodgers the only man who could make me start a song with a chorus ' rodgers helped reinvigorate bowie in the music video era and the high profile success he 'd suddenly attained may have frustrated him later but it initially sparked a spirit of advocacy it wa during this period that he 'd become fairly outspoken on the issue of racism 'as much a i love this country it 's probably one of the most racially intolerant in the world well in line with south africa he told rolling stone in when discussing his time in australia 'i mean in the north there 's unbelievable intolerance the aborigine ca n't even buy their drink in the same bars'they have to go round the back and get them through what 's called a 'dog hatch ' and then they 're forbidden from drinking them on the same side of the street a the bar they have to go to the other side of the road 'it occurred to me that one doe n't have much time on the planet you know he stated 'and that i could do something more useful in term of i know this is very clich but i feel that now that i 'm thirty six year old and i 've got a certain position i want to start utilizing that position to the benefit of my brotherhood and sisterhood he wince but continues 'i 've found it 's very easy to be successful in other term but i think you ca n't keep on being an artist without actually saying anything more than 'well this is an interesting way of looking at thing ' 'there is also a right way of looking at thing there 's a lot of injustice so let 's you know say something about it however naff it come off when discussing the concept behind the video from the album bowie made it clear 'very simple very direct they 're almost like russian social realism very naive and the message that they have is very simple ' it 's wrong to be racist the video for 'let 's dance focused on an indigenous couple in australia with reference to slavery and aboriginal child who 'd been kidnapped but the 'china girl video wa more uncomfortable bordering on the fetishizing of 'exotic asian womanhood in what wa supposed to be a message about interracial love bowie would spend the rest of the ' s wrestling with mtv era stardom before marrying somalian supermodel and philanthropist iman in the early s during a appearance on the arsenio hall show bowie wa asked whether he or iman had ever been given a hard time for being in an interracial relationship 'that 's a very strange situation for me because i think with both of u having the so called 'celebrity status ' attached to u i think the moment we step out the door we 're known more a david and iman so i 'm not sure what it would be like for u said bowie 'funnily enough you do n't see that many mixed couple in america in europe there are a lot of mixed couple over here it 's still a rarity there 's still this great separatist kind of thing over here so i do n't know what it would be like for u if we were n't known in our own right you get the odd snide remark but nothing of any weight 'it doe n't bug you though arsenio prodded 'it would do yeah it would bug me a lot bowie replied 'i 'd get mad i 'd hit him like a lorry driver'no like a truck driver later on in the interview arsenio would praise bowie for donating the proceeds from his single 'black tie white noise to an educational center for at risk black kid that same year bowie wa interviewed on the today show where he expressed his admiration for hip hop 's topicality 'you were saying that the only people in the music business now in your opinion who were being truly creative were the rapper host bryant gumbel asked 'yes i believe that 's so bowie responded 'the quality and significance of the social message ha moved very much to the black and hispanic market and that 's where the new force of music is coming from with black music there 's a very strong social point to make there 's a mean of discovery and a purpose in when six black teen were charged in an alleged attack on a white classmate in the tiny central louisiana town of jena bowie contributed to a legal defense fund for the youngster who 'd been targeted with hate crime prior to the incident bowie 's history with race and racism is much like everything else in his public life a study in phase whether you want to declare him 'progressive is debatable but he seemed to at least believe in the redemption that could come from addressing ill a he saw them especially a they affected music and art his nazi flirtation stand in sharp contrast to who he 'd been throughout his life but they mark a necessary part of his evolution in delving deep into the darkest facet of eurocentricity and white supremacy maybe bowie saw an ugliness staring back at him that he could n't stomach it would be cynical to dismiss his public statement a simple pr move even a he wa decade removed from the thin white duke period but it would be na ve to assume he did n't have to work to unpack whatever he 'd absorbed ideologically in the mid s regardless it 's worth noting that this man wa able to address issue that so many of today 's white superstar seem all too eager to run from in an age where racism is such an urgent part of the national conversation maybe america could use a few more david bowie standing alongside the black and brown artist fighting for change we do n't need you to speak for u but that doe n't mean you should remain silent,105980.0

woman'and it certainly ha n't been for barbie mattel announced today that barbie 's fashionista line of doll will now offer three different body type tall petite and most notably curvy the doll will also be offered with more skin tone and hairstyle 'we believe we have a responsibility to girl and parent to reflect a broader view of beauty senior vice president and global general manager barbie evelyn mazzocco said in a press release there will be tall petite and curvy barbie shape in an effort to offer more diverse and realistic doll option tall barbie is specifically tall and lean and she look pretty much like the traditional barbie mattel ha noted that these new doll will have flat foot rather than the ever en pointe one so perhaps tall barbie 's hoof mark the biggest difference from her predecessor petite barbie is shorter than usual barbie but again she appears from the press photo to be pretty much just a skinny a the barbie i played with a a child the only shape where barbie could not be considered thin is in the curvy barbie the one getting the most attention and even curvy barbie doe n't seem particularly heavy i would doubt her body mass index bmi would qualify her a overweight and certainly not a obese which according to the u s center for disease control around one third of american adult are though born a full bodied woman barbie is a child of the baby boom premiering in at the american toy fair in new york city mattel co founder ruth handler sought an alternative to baby doll for young girl so she bought the right to the german bild lillie a doll that wa based off a 'saucy high end call girl according to time com and sold to grown men that model explains barbie 's famously sexy physique itty bitty waist foot so tiny they looked like a product of chinese foot binding perfectly round as and of course breast that would make jane russell jealous little girl grew up idolizing barbie a the perfect woman the ultimate model of feminine beauty with her impossible to achieve body and then some of these little girl grew up into feminist who were repulsed by the unrealistic physical standard that barbie tacitly promoted and questioned what if any professional ambition she fostered though barbie 's website boast she 'broke the 'plastic ceiling ' in the s when a an astronaut she went to the moon'four year before neil armstrong barbie ha served in a wide range of profession from ob gyn i had this one to police officer to presidential candidate and barbie even ditched ken that ol ' ball and chain to hack it a a single lady for at least a few year but the famous barbie build that so rankled parent concerned about their child 's sense of body image did n't really change'until now the pressure on barbie to change her look ha become a modern constant invoking a study brandy zadrozny noted in the daily beast in that barbie 's bad rap wa catching up to her 'barbie actually weakens a girl 's career ambition zadrozny wrote describing an oregon state university study that showed 'girls who were given barbies to play with thought they could do fewer 'boy job ' than girl who played with mr potato head at that point barbie 's popularity wa already plummeting sale had peaked in almost exactly a year ago in january mattel 's board fired it ceo bryan stockton because barbie 's popularity had plummeted with a percent drop in earnings

a someone who grew up playing with barbies and loving them far beyond the timeframe of social acceptability note to year old self do not invite middle school peer over to play with barbies i 'm ambivalent about the barbie body reboot based on my own experience i wa suspect of how bad barbie wa for child even a a grown woman with enough body image issue to keep a therapist in business until north west is old enough to start her own twitter battle i ca n't blame barbie for these insecurity when i wa growing up it did n't take long to realize i wa overweight and looked different from some unrealistic feminine beauty ideal but that had more to do with the woman i obsessed over in pop culture'the svelte lady of friend the toned woman of the spice girl their fitness wa clearly not exclusive to sporty 'and of course teasing classmate sarai walker an expert on female body image pressure and author of 's dietland an acclaimed feminist novel about a woman who rebel against societal pressure on woman to lose weight said she also grew up loving barbie 'i played with barbie and i grew up into this feminist writer and wrote a radical novel about feminism walker told the daily beast 'it 's hard to know how barbie affected me but i do think she 's become the symbol of our protest against body ideal and objectification she said however walker wa also ambivalent about how much of the onus of body shaming should be thrusted on barbie 'she 's a convenient villain walker said 'she 's a symptom of a much larger problem so many thing play into it not just barbie walker wa dubious of how dramatic a change these barbie shape especially the curvy one marked sure curvy barbie is at least a bit more ample but she 's more like a somewhat enlarged version of her drooled over hourglass figure in short barbie 's body still meet the conventional standard for female physical beauty 'she doe n't threaten the status quo walker said 'someone who is curvy is plus sized but acceptable walker noted 'she barbie doe n't look all that different from the traditional barbie she 's kind of like christina hendricks'larger than what we 're used to seeing on tv but men still swoon over her walker ha a different idea of what a truly revolutionary barbie would be 'i do n't know if mattel could ever make a doll whose main purpose wa n't to be cute and attractive to boy and men i would love to see them dare to do something like that it may be a fantasy to expect mattel or any toy company to start producing doll that are n't just expanding conception of beauty but rather rooted in telling girl and boy that worrying about whether people think you 're beautiful pretty or hot is superficial bunk but if barbie can beat armstrong to the moon than making such a doll should be

homer 's iliad published in the last decade if you answered a you 'd be right but by a very slim margin last month with the arrival of caroline alexander 's version of homer 's great epic'the first ever by a woman if that matters'the iliad drew just just one shy of the nine republican contender who appeared in december 's debate given the increasingly rapid pace at which new iliad keep emerging we will likely see another before the iowa caucuses'all this while older version of the poem some dating back century continue to get reissued with new note introduction and cover illustration for reader and for teacher like myself the range of choice ha become bewildering some translator prefer a five beat line of verse like shakespeare 's others something closer to the six beat line of the original still others blend the two or a in alexander 's case stick to no clear metrical scheme at all 'a cadence ' which varies from verse to verse a she describes it in her introduction do you fancy rhymed couplet the once great version by george chapman and alexander pope have been recently repackaged a ha the prose version by victorian novelist samuel butler and for those who prefer modernist twist on ancient classic christopher logue 's war music'a reimagining of homer 's epic in an imagistic style'will appear in a new more complete version next month augmented by material logue left unfinished in his declining year after working on the poem on and off for five decade translation proliferation is certainly not among the worst of the anxiety afflicting the modern world but it is of a piece with others higher up the list swarthmore psychologist barry schwartz begin his book the paradox of choice with a stroll through a midsize american grocery store with it hundred of cracker variety score of sunblock choice and seven variety of cheerio a number that ha since expanded well into double digit those already oppressed by the overabundance of the mall and market now have to cope with it also in the bookstore a place one used to go knowing exactly what one wanted and what one wa going to get the barnes noble website list book under the word 'the iliad while amazon list many of these are summary or reader 's guide but dozen are full translation it wa not ever thus classic graduate student in the s of whom i wa one debated the relative merit of richmond lattimore and robert fitzgerald the only two iliad then in wide circulation a new version by robert fagles appeared in and for most of that decade the three r had the field of homer translation entirely to themselves then stanley lombardo entered the ring in with his streamlined and brashly colloquial style in an edition that shocked the academic world by putting on it cover a photo from the d day invasion since then the graph of new iliad translation ha followed a parabolic curve trend in publishing have led to greater diversity of many greek and roman text but none have multiplied quite so fast a the iliad in part because none are so widely assigned by college teacher a the classic ' share of the curriculum ha shrunk homer ha remained the blue chip stock that belongs in every portfolio the one ancient author that the entire college community'including student who increasingly challenge faculty on the makeup of their reading lists'can agree is worth reading so the iliad and to a lesser extent the odyssey can be counted on to produce a steady stream of revenue for publisher every time fall and spring term book order come due it wa reported in the wall street journal that caroline alexander 's version despite being the 'new kid on the block would have an initial print run of and that robert fagles ' version ha by now sold more than a million the profit motive may explain the spate of new translation but the proliferation of translator is more puzzling given that a responsible hellenist need year of labor to render more than line of greek verse into passably accurate euphonious english and can expect very little in the way of either financial reward or in the rank of academia at least professional advancement whence come this great throng of men and now one woman who follow in homer 's trail like enchanted child following the pied piper caroline alexander is an interesting case in point a rhodes scholar and classicist turned journalist and nonfiction writer in the s with article in the new yorker and a best selling book on shackleton 's antarctic expedition she seemed to have cast her lot with prose not poetry and to have left the ancient greek behind then in came the war that killed achilles her exploration for a wide readership of the meaning of the iliad alexander took homeric quote from the richmond lattimore version of but also included her own version of a single chapter of the poem '' not ' because it wa felt that lattimore 's work could be improved upon she wrote 'but because ' it seemed an impertinence to lift an entire chapter of another scholar 's work that taste of translation seems to have changed her mind a to whether lattimore could be bettered for she devoted much of the next five year to doing just that even more curious is the case of peter green the greek historian who came out with a version of the iliad this year at the age of green got his first taste of translating homer in the early s a part of a team assembled by the bbc to produce a radio version of the iliad'a team that also included christopher logue but he thereafter devoted his energy to more scholarly enterprise producing widely admired study of alexander the great and the hellenistic age translation of work by ovid and catullus showed he also had an ear for poetry but nothing could have predicted that following his retirement from teaching he would devote the last stage of an illustrious career to englishing homer 'from time to time'not least when i saw another version of the iliad or the odyssey collecting tribute in the headlines'a sad twinge of regret ' would nag at me green writes in his preface 'but it wa only a year ago when i realized that on my next birthday i wa going to that i asked myself what i had to lose even now by tackling the iliad it 's a rare sort of person who put 'translate the iliad ' on his bucket list but green report that he ha found great satisfaction in meeting this challenge and that he ha now embarked on the odyssey a task that will surely take him into his mid if not late ninety then there 's barry powell an emeritus professor at the university of wisconsin who built his reputation on academic study like homer and the origin of the greek alphabet after an editor at oxford university approached powell about translating homer instead of analyzing him the hook wa set 'when i told my friend about this project they said 'but ha n't homer already been translated many time ' yes sure i tried to explain but not by me say powell in the preface to his iliad one suspect that this macbeth like story line'in which an acquisition editor plant the seed of ambition in the mind of a prominent scholar offering a new and undreamed of future'has played out many time among the rank of recent translator the generation of men are like leaf on a tree homer wrote in iliad book and new version of his poem have occupied many leaf and have required the felling of countless tree the diversity of style and voice in the new publishing landscape is in many way a good thing since readers'at least those willing to do an hour or two of research'can find an iliad that closely suit their taste but there are inevitable downside to a world in which nearly anyone whatever their poetic talent can fulfill a lifelong dream by getting their version of the iliad into print it might seem hyperbolic to say even my neighbor is doing one but in my case it 's literally true since poet charles stein author of an already published odyssey now well into a translation of homer 's other epic life just down my street before committing to any new iliad however reader are well advised to consult daniel mendelsohn 's new yorker squib comparing recent version and deciding that alexander pope 's just now reaching it th anniversary is 'at once the grandest and most minutely detailed there is ever likely to be so much for progress,4752.0

bomb test at a m pyongyang time if the claim is true the regime of kim jong un ha made far more progress in developing nuclear weapon than believed even if the boast is false the detonation is a dangerous signal the test which triggered international earthquake detection system will plunge the region into a diplomatic crisis and intensifies concern about nuclear proliferation to iran in december north korea made a claim that it possessed a hydrogen weapon which release energy from the fusion of atomic particle the fusion reaction of an h bomb is first triggered by a fission explosion the north is known to have detonated three crude fission device which derive their power from the splitting of particle in and at the moment little is known for sure the u s geological survey today detected a magnitude tremor in northeast north korea close to punggye ri the spot of the three prior detonation the south korean and chinese seismological service also measured the event it is almost certain therefore that north korea detonated a nuclear device of some kind but wa it an h bomb which is substantially more powerful than fission device and much harder to build it is more likely a joe cirincione president of the plowshare fund tweeted that north korea set off a so called boosted fission weapon a device whose yield is enhanced with tritium it may take week for the international community to learn the truth of north korea 's h bomb claim and it 's possible we may not know for year the united state to this day for instance ha not learned whether the device the north detonated in had a plutonium or uranium core south korea report that the detonation today took place near the earth 's surface it is much more likely the device wa a measured by the u s kilometer underground the farther below the surface the le likely the united state or any other country will be able to 'sniff the particle released by the detonation and thereby learn about the nature of the device in any event a simple fission detonation is also bad news especially if north korea used the opportunity to develop a miniaturized warhead in april norad chief admiral william gortney said north korea could target america 's west coast with it mobile kn missile which can carry a nuclear warhead the kn is a special threat because it can hide and shoot which mean it is hard to destroy on the ground the kn is a relatively small missile which mean the north need to develop a light weight warhead it appears a missile launch is coming soon a bruce bechtol jr author of north korea and regional security in the kim jong un era ha pointed out north korean nuke and missile test come in pair 'we have seen nuclear test conducted within a very short time frame'either before or after'long range ballistic missile test he told the daily beast after today 's detonation another reason why today 's test would be ominous is that iran may have witnessed it and helped the north korean during all three previous north korean detonation iranian including the shadowy mohsen fakhrizadeh the chief of tehran 's nuclear program were present the presence of personnel from iran at the site would have serious implication for the just concluded nuclear agreement with tehran the assumption of the p the five permanent member of the security council and germany wa that the inspector of the international atomic energy agency would be able to inspect iranian facility to ensure that iran did not have a nuclear weapon if iran 's nuclear weapon program is located in north korea however tehran can build and store weapon thousand of mile beyond the site monitored by international inspector and there is one other reason why the test is of special concern a bechtol note north korea 's decision to go ahead with it detonation today indicates that the regime of kim jong un doe not place much importance on it relation with the u s or it neighbor like china and south korea for instance the detonation completely undermines the basis of south korean president park geun hye 's signature 'trustpolitik policy of engagement with the north similarly the test show that beijing is no longer able to influence kim china ha for year expressed it displeasure with the north continuing it nuclear weapon program in fact there are rumor that kim jong un cancelled the high profile performance in beijing by his moranbong band last month because while the group wa there china expressed irritation with his bragging of possessing an h bomb kim ha deliberately cut tie with his regime 's only formal military ally and sponsor since the end of north korea once again ha decided to go on it own and that is true whether the detonation today wa of a crude device or a claimed a sophisticated one kim 's militant regime the international community saw today is making steady progress in developing the world 's most destructive weapon,25230.0

jennifer lopez on a cop show and she 's pretty good of course the title shade of blue is n't referring to m lopez 's flawless makeup job but to the level of corruption that her character detective harlee santos and her scooby doo crew of fellow officer justify a a mean to do their job they 're not good or evil thing are n't black and white there are shade in between'at least i 've heard of them hey o the premise for the show is outlined in a monologue harlee tearfully record on her computer in the show 's opening second 'i always wanted to be a good cop she whisper 'but there 's no straight line to that i always told myself that the end would justify the mean but now that i 'm at the end i ca n't justify anything it happened so slowly i did n't realize and so quickly i never saw it coming then we 're transported to two week earlier to find out what motivated the recording jenny is patrolling the block when a sting go awry our heroine cover it up with masterful skill and speed 'i 'll protect you she tell a bumbling rookie 'but you got ta trust me and then the tried and true corrupt cop line 'the truth is in the paperwork if it sound like a line that 's been said before it 's because it probably ha in fact most of what you 'll find in shade of blue is shade of similar arguably better show about crooked cop that came before it so why not just watch the shield or the wire then which tread much similar ground did it without the constraint of broadcast standard and are readily available on streaming they do n't star jennifer lopez of course it seems like a millennium ago when it wa announced that lopez would be starring in an nbc cop series it wa both a confusing and obvious move for the multi hyphenate why would the glamorous movie star with a music career american idol judging duty an upcoming la vega residency and professionally making u normal drool over how flawless she looks'girlfriend is slash possibly a witch 'commit to the hum drum rigmarole of a broadcast tv shooting schedule but then again of course jennifer lopez would star a a dirty cop with a heart of gold on a nbc procedural it 's on brand with her conquering of every other medium she 's taken on create something mediocre work four time harder than anyone else would on it turn it into something actually worth consuming and look fine a hell while doing it because shade of blue is not the next great cop drama but it's'well it 's fine it 's familiar not just in it echo of those previously mentioned great drama of the past but because of the very modern way it blend procedural with soap opera there are element of scandal 's twistiness and moral ambiguity to complement the law and order trope that really you crave when you 're watching a police drama on nbc ray liotta is pitch perfect'as in rocking that gravelly growly scary a hell pitch of his'as lieutenant matt wozniak the godfather of this close knit family of corrupt cop he ha a fatherly relationship with harlee for complicated reason that eventually unfold he speaks in non stop wonderful cringe worthy metaphor such a in this exceptionally rich tirade directed at harlee 'you want to save a pup from drowning i appreciate the instinct'never risk a hole in my boat unless you 're positive you can plug it'do n't get wobbly one slip at the wrong time and we all go tumbling down and i do n't tumble well you begin to accept even adore these wooden aspect of the show a a litany of twist begin entering at whiplash pace harlee get nabbed by the fbi while orchestrating one of her dirty deal the fbi coerces her into being a mole to take down wozniak wozniak suspect there 's a mole he suspect it 's her the cat and mouse game ensues and you know what jennifer lopez and ray liotta are excellent cat and mouse there 's strong direction here too keeping you riveted at least through the three episode i 've seen seizing on lopez 's controlled performance to ground thing a the twist get loopier and loopier closeted homosexuality baby daddy drama and possible hate crime all pop up the first two episode are directed by barry levinson an alum of homicide life on the street another series with a heavy influence on shade levinson know his way around a good gritty cop drama and it show his action set piece are thrilling the pilot alone pair several key action scene with song like 'no church in the wild 'beautiful people and 'chandelier and they are fun but let 's be honest none of that is important this is the jennifer lopez show and for all the thing that shade of blue ha going for and against it that 's the only thing that matter is j lo good in it yes and will it help her career yes few celebrity boast a magnetic a camera presence or have a much tangible charm a jennifer lopez it 's why she became one of the last bankable rom com star in the early s on the back of so so fare like the wedding planner and maid in manhattan but movie star likability and a platinum selling music career have distracted from one of lopez 's key talent she 's an excellent actress sure the vehicle she 's given are often crap but she 's always convincing the boy next door wa unfathomably silly but lopez leaned into the camp of it all with such gusto that i 'm convinced the ridiculous thriller saved her career revenge tale enough wa a stinker if there ever wa one but i stand by my assertion that lopez 's toughened performance stand among the best of that year and have you seen anaconda lately do n't but trust that j lo is quite good in it once in a while'and how quickly we all forget'lopez 's talent is matched by the project selena folk selena god jennifer lopez wa so good in selena even better though is out of sight out of sight filmed nearly two decade ago is the perfect comparison point for shade of blue hitfix critic alan sepinwall said it best 'as out of sight heroine karen sisco lopez wa cool confident and tougher than every man in that movie combined since then she 's kept trying to prove that she can play vulnerable rather than embracing her inherent j lo awesomeness shade of blue is not a vehicle on par with out of sight one of the best film of but it 's the showcase j lo fans'hi i 'm kevin and i am here for j lo'have been waiting for a lopez navigates new route in her tangled maze of a career this is an important reminder of the strength of her ability a an actor and a powerhouse capable of carrying a season of a network show she 's cool confident and tough she 's in an acting battle of wit with ray liotta and coming out on top that vulnerability that sepinwall refers to seeps through more than some may like but i appreciate the excuse the pun shade it allows in her performance she and the rest of the show 's creative team make you care about what happens to harlee while still making you feel like she 's in real danger in an age of soulless sanitized and predictable broadcast procedurals that 's all a small miracle shade of blue is n't perfect nothing 's perfect

federal government policy then every single person in the oregon siege must be arrested and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law period but shockingly there are sign that these men may go free the local sheriff david ward just a few day ago met with their leader ammon bundy and offered them 'safe passage out of the state bundy who ha called for a meeting on friday between his men and local authority to discus this noted that they will likely take the sheriff 's offer and 'we will go out of this state and out of this county a free men free men well actually i 'm all for these men being free eventually but first they deserve 'safe passage from the federal building they have illegally commandeered to the back of police car from there they should be taken to police station where they will be fingerprinted etc and charged with a string of federal crime then they should be arraigned before a judge and if they can make bail released until they have their day in court if all go a it seems it should they will be convicted of at least one felony be required under federal law to give up their weapon and then serve time in prison and assuming they do n't cause more problem while in federal prison they will then be released and finally have earned the right to be 'free men but only then should they be free men these armed men must be called to answer for their crime just like any other american the most serious charge they likely face is 'sedition under federal law 'seditious conspiracy is defined a using force 'to seize take or posse any property of the united state contrary to the authority the bundy gang illegally taking control of federal property because they want to coerce the federal government to change it policy is the very definition of sedition this crime carry with it a prison term of up to year they also intentional destroyed federal property a few day ago namely a fence that wa erected to prevent local famers from allowing their cattle to graze on federal property this fence wa built by the u s fish and wildlife service using a grant destruction of federal property that exceeds in value is punishable by a fine and imprisonment of up to year and the list of crime go on from there from trespassing to unauthorized use of government property they used a government computer to build a website and utilized government vehicle they also may be charged for violating oregon state law in addition to jail time these men should be ordered to reimburse the government for the cost associated with their crime an oregon judge noted that the county 's security cost in connection with this siege are per day despite what some on the right argue these armed anti government protester are not just like the occupy wall street protester but if you do want to compare them then keep in mind that nearly occupy protester were arrested and while the criminal charge were later dismissed against many some had to endure a full trial and even jail time in addition occupy protester were forcibly dragged off sidewalk by the police and infamously one group of protester had mace sprayed in their face while doing nothing more than sitting on the sidewalk what a contrast to what we are seeing now with the bundy insurgent these men are destroying federal property in full public view and the police simply sit idly by and i hardly even need to note how much differently the authority would treat the armed men if they were black or muslim justice demand that these men go to jail after all sister kathleen desautels wa sentenced to six month in jail for trespassing on a u s military base for a matter of minute in connection with a protest opposing u s military policy desautels and others simply went around the fence surrounding the military base and were then immediately arrested by police waiting on the other side should an unarmed nun who snuck unto a military base and wa quickly arrested without incident get more jail time than an armed group of men who have illegally taken control of a federal building for week intentionally destroyed federal property and vowed that they will kill people if they are attacked sheriff ward should be commended for wanting to end this stand off peacefully and his offer of safe passage doe not necessarily mean no criminal charge will be filed despite how bundy view it although even safe passage alone is a generous offer given that not only ha ward been subject to death threat by bundy supporter his wife had to leave town for her own safety after her tire were slashed and she wa followed by stranger and even more disturbing the sheriff 's elderly parent have been harassed by bundy supporter a a nation we can not make the same mistake a last year when the armed stand off at the bundy ranch in nevada ended with no arrest if that happens here expect even more of these type of armed stand offs and possibly even innocent american being killed bundy and his men are not above the law simply because they claim they are on a mission from god just like isi militant are not above the law by making the identical claim,63771.0

of lead poisoning after the city began using the flint river a a drinking water supply in the incidence of elevated blood lead level among flint child under age five nearly doubled from percent to percent according to research led by dr mona hanna attisha at the hurley medical center and released in september of last year now an e mail obtained by nbc news show that an epidemiologist notified

option but investigator now know that after the switch the highly corrosive river water leached lead from pipe into people 's home flint mayor karen weaver ha said that it could cost a much a billion to repair the city 's water infrastructure last week in response to month of complaint michigan governor rick snyder declared a state of emergency this wednesday he activated the national guard to distribute clean water to flint resident and asked for aid from fema the blame the litigation and the investigation are all underway in november the epa announced that it would investigate whether the michigan department of environmental quality mdeq violated the safe drinking water act sdwa by not treating the flint river water with an anti corrosive agent before sending it through the system and at the end of the year mdeq head dan wyant resigned after an independent task force faulted his agency 's handling of the situation but a the crisis continues some in the community are soberly turning their attention to the future now that the damage ha been done what will happen to the next generation of flint kid lower iq learning problem slowed growth inability to pay attention these are a few of the long term effect that lead poisoning can have on child according to the epa and the cdc other effect include anemia and hyperactivity lead harm adult too but a the world health organization who note in a special report on childhood lead poisoning the effect of lead on young brain are 'untreatable and irreversible in population that have had widespread exposure to lead the who report note 'there result a substantial increase in the number of child with diminished intelligence and mental retardation accompanied by 'a substantial reduction in the number of child with truly superior intelligence in the u s waterborne lead on the scale of flint 's current crisis is not unprecedented in the washington post drew attention to high level of lead in d c 's water supply the cdc initially minimized the severity of the crisis but after an independent study found that a many a child had been put at risk a congressional review prompted the cdc to label it earlier reporting a 'misleading the effect of lead on large population can be slow to manifest a dr hanna attisha 's team noted when first presenting on flint 's lead crisis some child may be 'asymptomatic now but that doe n't mean they wo n't face problem later 'if there wa ever a time to invest in our child it is now dr hanna attisha said in a press release for the community foundation of greater flint cfgf which is now asking for nationwide donation to the flint child health and development fund to help cover the short and long term cost of the crisis in conjunction with a committee of resident and community organization the fund will be used to provide social service early childhood education behavioral health service and more to flint kid community organization will be seeking government funding throughout this crisis too but at this point charitable giving may indeed be one of flint 's best bet the state of michigan 's early on program for developmentally disabled and delayed child may not be prepared for an influx of lead poisoned flint kid say matt gillard president and ceo of the policy advocacy organization michigan 's child in an op ed for the flint journal last week gillard called for increased state funding to early on noting that elevated blood lead level are an eligibility factor for inclusion in the program 'the child of flint will need more than new declaration of emergency state level resignation and public apology to help reverse the damage that ha been done to their young body and developing brain gillard wrote already he say flint parent are discovering the limitation of the state run program 'what 's undoubtedly going to happen and what 's already happening in flint is that more kid are identified a being eligible for early on but the resource to

a rickety horse drawn wagon but it is also home to some of the most robust underground crime network in the country dealing in drug and illegal weapon and every few year bringing their inter gang war onto the street violent crime is endemic throughout the arab sector in israel where police estimate that close to half a million illegal gun are in circulation since more than people have been killed in israel 's arab sector including woman murdered in 'honor killing a revenge act in exchange for woman perceived to be behaving sexually improperly however organized crime network make the israeli headline only in particularly grim case such a last year 's murder of a school principal during a staff meeting or more frequently when that violence spill over into mainstream jewish society a in the case of the january terror attack at a tel aviv pub in which neshat melhelm an arab israeli shot dead three israelis'two jew and an arab 'if an arab kill another arab the police do n't care it 's only when the weapon make their way out of our community doe anyone pay attention said renin oudeh shawana the director of the 'mustaqbal or 'future youth program in jaljuliya her relative wa one of the two victim in of killing in the village following a disagreement between two gang after the shooting police came to look for evidence but never returned to follow up a a result of this pattern of police impunity gang have become emboldened over the past year and have increasingly attracted member among the many teenager in town who 'simply have nothing to do and want to feel that they belong somewhere said oudeh shawana arab politician and community leader have for year pressed the government to rid the community of their crime ring and illegal weapon inventory and while prime minister benjamin netanyahu ha acknowledged the lack of law enforcement he recently shocked many arab israeli by blaming the problem on them and their alleged lack of loyalty to the state melhelm the tel aviv shooter wa killed by police in a gunfight in the village of arara on january so far it is unclear whether his killing spree wa motivated by the ongoing palestinian uprising a connection to the so called islamic state mental instability or perhaps something else altogether however the attack spurred many israeli to fiercely deliberate what punishment should be meted out to arab israeli whom they found responsible for his action and whom they said exhibited ingratitude for the high quality of life they are able to enjoy in israel 'whoever want to be israeli must be israeli all the way ' i will not accept two state within israel said netanyahu following the tel aviv attack referring to division between israel and it arab community where 'there are enclave without law enforcement with islamist propaganda with plenty of weapon often fired during wedding celebration with constant crime the accusation wa especially jarring since it came only three day after netanyahu 's likud party announced that it would dedicate a record billion to correct the sector 's severe socio economic woe by developing infrastructure employment public transportation and the educational system following the attack netanyahu promised to beef up police presence in the arab community but said that both proposal would be conditioned on 'good behavior 'a phrase widely interpreted certainly in the arab community to mean it will never happen nonetheless local leader continue to work toward reforming policing in a divided israel where security force have tended to see arab including the more than million within it border a a security threat rather than citizen in need of protection amnon beeri sulitzeanu co director of the joint jewish arab ngo the abraham fund initiative that seek to establish equality in israel said that over the past decade there ha been incremental success in creating trust and cooperation between the police and the arab population but he added there 's still a lot to be done 'if you measure the number of arab casualty it 's le than it used to be but still there are case in which the finger of the police are quicker on the trigger when confronting an arab assailant in comparison with a jewish citizen he said securing effective law enforcement is a major focus for jaljuliya mayor fayek oudeh who say that over the past year the community ha seen thug youth fill the leadership void once occupied by the village 's traditional hamula or family clan structure 'we are citizen of the country we respect it law but at the same time are seeing a new generation that suffers from discrimination and want more oudeh said 'if israel would provide u fund that would help our socioeconomic situation we would be able to prevent the violence and the idea that the young people have no future arab youth in israel are coming of age in a tumultuous time a the islamic movement is gaining in influence and popularity in many marginalized area and they are answering the call to resist the israeli occupation alongside their brother in the west bank and gaza they are frustrated both by daily discrimination by israeli authority and by the dashed hope of a palestinian state they are also swayed by argument circulated by the highly influential islamic movement that the jew pose a threat to the sacred temple mount site in jerusalem a a result they have participated in the 'knife intifada now in it fourth month in which mostly young people are repurposing knife cleaver and vehicle a non conventional weapon against civilian and soldier more than arab assailant have been killed by israeli fire further incensing those who accuse the israeli security force of using excessive violence israel ha attempted to confront arab incitement by banning the northern branch of the islamic movement an offshoot of egypt 's muslim brotherhood led by the firebrand salah raed which ha called upon the marginalized arab community of israel to 'liberate jerusalem

a poll conducted by sammy smooha a sociology professor at haifa university found that percent of that population believe that isi is not an extremist terror organization and that it doe not tarnish the reputation of muslim smooha say that in many arab community of israel which are generally lacking in youth program there is little in the way of educating against isi a a result there is a 'silent majority of the arab community with some sympathy for the organization either because of genuine islamic conviction or 'as a little protest against israel which discriminates against them personally

of the nearly u s backed force made some of their biggest gain in syria in recent month when they retook village near the hotly contested city of aleppo with the help of russian airstrikes the russian attack targeted other opposition group and the u s backed coalition exploited them to gain back part of the city the russian strike were not designed to help those u s backed force nor were the group coordinating with the russian but nevertheless the air attack allowed the u s created syrian democratic front to make advance four defense official told the daily beast 'it 's not a planned thing it is not something russian are trying to do it is happenstance one u s official told the daily beast 'the net sum of everything the russian are doing help assad and prolongs the war and now u s official fear such success could create a new alliance between it proxy force in syria and the russian military which american general have repeatedly called a potential 'existential threat to the united state the russian strike could appeal to the kurd because the u s led coalition 's air war is aimed almost exclusively at the self proclaimed islamic state whereas the russian have attacked any group opposed to assad the kurd and syrian rebel want to see assad toppled a well a isi defeated official believe that within day of russian airstrikes on position held by the nusra front al qaeda 's branch in syria kurdish force moved forward to take at least three village within the city helping them make notable gain aleppo syria 's second biggest city ha long been a battlefield and a prize for nearly every group vying to control territory in syria there is no indication of direct communication between the american backed ground force and the russian u s official said but the fact that the kurd made so much progress in aleppo thanks to those russian airstrikes ha some u s official worried that a new kurdish russian alliance could form that would add another layer of complexity in an already fraught war in which alliance are constantly shifting the russian after all are committed to saving the bashar al assad regime the u s is formally committed to ending it and so far the obama administration ha resisted all call to put aside those difference and form some sort of grand alliance with the kremlin 'coordination with the kurd would allow for russia to continue to present itself a a worthwhile anti isi actor in syria while angering turkey and disrupting u s operation genevieve casagrande a research assistant at the institute for the study of war who focus on syria told the daily beast 'we are n't seeing this escalation quite yet but it is something that these airstrikes can open up the possibility for in the future two u s official told the daily beast they have seen a similar pattern of ground force moving in following russian airstrikes near raqqa the self proclaimed islamic state capital these land grab were n't a successful a those in aleppo official said no do they necessarily represent a harbinger for a future in which kurdish force overtly side with the russians'a development that could potentially undermine the kurd ' alliance with the u s and strengthen russia 's influence two u s official told the daily beast that the rebel and the kurd were n't likely to take side with the russian at least not in the near term their alliance with the u s ha largely been one of battlefield convenience but the ground force have a longer history with the american that they 're not likely to abandon overnight the official argued still a kurdish and rebel alliance with the russian ca n't be ruled out indeed in the complex stew of the syrian conflict various faction have coordinated with their adversary 'if you look at the entire course of fighting on the ground it 's an enemy of my enemy is my friend war daveed gartenstein ross a senior fellow at the foundation for the defense of democracy told the daily beast the ypg'the syrian kurdish military forces'has coordinated with the assad regime and the free syrian army ha done so with al nusra he said in that context it 's not only plausible that u s backed and allied group would coordinate with the russian it 's likely recent event could also be driving the kurd closer to moscow after turkey shot down a russian jet it said had crossed into it airspace last year russian took to social medium to express sympathy for and solidarity with the kurd in their conflict with turkey also in november the kurdish democratic union party began meeting with russia to discus it own plan for greater self rule that wa an apparent stab at the u s russia 's strategic rival and arguably a bid to win washington 's support for kurdish independence a well a more weapon one more reason the kurd might saddle up with moscow they would n't necessarily see their new alliance a turning their back on the u s the russian are conducting more strike and have le compunction than the american led coalition about whom they target the result ha been a terrible human toll most recently the syrian observatory for human right alleged russian strike in aleppo killed at least child and three adult but the kurdish rebel may be using a different calculus 'i think from their perspective there 's no reason that they would n't work with the russian and with u gartenstein ross said 'the russian have at this point a more robust presence i 'm not sure they 'd see it a betraying their relation with the u s,14241.0

anbar province 'i 'm in ramadi he said that wa how i learned that the provincial capital a key to the west of the country had been liberated from the so called islamic state or a the arab say daesh it had been over one and a half year since jaber had last seen his native city it wa a bitter sweet moment 'i am happy because we liberated the city from these criminal he told me but he wa heartbroken to see ramadi reduced to rubble jaber had driven from baghdad accompanying governor suhaib al rawi the chief of the police and local security force he found ramadi deserted only the counter terrorism forces'who had conducted most of the fighting to liberate the city'were visible in the street before daesh had taken over around people had lived there now only a few thousand remained and some of those were trapped in enclave still controlled by daesh and while the so called islamic state is losing territory it remains able to conduct deadly operation like those carried out monday at a shopping mall in baghdad and in muqdadiyah airstrikes and bomb planted in house and alongside road had left ramadi in ruin whole neighborhood had been leveled power line were down infrastructure wa totally destroyed and the bridge across the euphrates'one of which dated back to the british time in iraq in the first half of the last century'were no more a jaber walked through the carcass of what had once been anbar university he told me he broke down in tear on graduating from baghdad medical college in the s jaber had helped one of his professor tareq al hadithi set up the college of medicine in anbar university after jaber had poured his energy into renovating the university and establishing student dormitory he had shown the french ambassador around the university and they had discussed establishing a french language institute now all those dream of investing in future generation had disintegrated he could not even make out where the medical laboratory had once been 'i have so many good memory from this city ' his voice trailed off jaber had built a new house there a few year ago 'last time i wa here everything looked fine now all his possession were stolen and his house mere debris when daesh had moved into ramadi jaber and two of his sister had moved to baghdad two of his brother left to amman another sister had gone to iraqi kurdistan joining the majority of ramadi 's resident while those with money rented place many lived in tent in camp relying on family and friend to make end meet they had sold their gold and whatever they could take with them before they fled jaber estimated that over percent of iraq 's sunni were displaced from their home daesh had murdered jaber 's brother in law and a niece who died when they were trying to kill her husband a military officer like many of anbar 's tribe loyalty in his family were mixed jaber remained supportive of the government and with the political process whereas one of his brother wa opposed to both the government and daesh and a small portion of his tribe were with daesh i peppered jaber with question how had everything gone so badly wrong in ramadi how had daesh been able to take over who were these people jaber described a subculture in ramadi of uneducated men in their twenty and thirty some were thief and petty criminal others had developed fundamentalist thinking and when al qaeda in iraq came into existence after the fall of the former regime it wa within that organization that they found a sense of power and identity however when the sahwa the anbar awakening turned against al qaeda and aligned with u force during the surge in many of these same young men were drawn away from the insurgency and swapped side turning themselves into local police and that wa why the violence in anbar had dramatically declined from onwards and stability had returned to the province the agreement that my former bos gen raymond odierno the then commander of u s force in iraq had negotiated with former prime minister nuri al maliki wa that percent of the sahwa would be integrated into the security force and percent into civilian job but the deal wa never implemented rather a u s force withdrew maliki reneged on his promise to the sahwa and arrested it leader he accused sunni politician of terrorism driving them out of the political process in response sunni set up protest camp but maliki refused to meet their demand and sent in security force to violently crush the demonstration with the citizen of ramadi so at odds with the central government once again it had been easy for daesh to rise up out of the ash of al qaeda in iraq and proclaim itself a the defender of the sunni daesh had taken over anbar university and converted it into a prison jaber explained that the tribe in anbar had lost trust in the government and refused to fight daesh they remembered only too clearly how the sahwa had been betrayed 'we could not convince them that the experience would be different from before finally tribesman were persuaded to join the tribal al hashd the popular mobilization force and received training from u s troop in base at taqqadum and al asad and it wa these tribesman who had supported the counter terrorism force in their effort to liberate ramadi from daesh at the end of governor al rawi ha been nominated a the head of the crisis committee which includes representative of ministry and is tasked with cleaning up the city removing explosive and restoring basic service to make ramadi inhabitable once more so that it displaced citizen will return but difficult time remain ahead there are huge challenge to rebuilding ramadi particularly with scarce resource available from the government due to the steep drop in oil price to under a barrel and looming large is the question of how to break the corrosive cycle of revenge and retribution that ha led to so many death and displacement jaber wa recently appointed to the new higher committee for national reconciliation established under the auspex of iraq 's prime minister the president and the speaker of parliament and with the mandate to promote 'historic national reconciliation reconciliation ha been talked about continually in iraq over the last decade'but little ha been done to address the structural challenge facing the country to agree on a workable system of government and to reinvent an inclusive national identity to which iraqi 's diverse people can relate many observer believe that iraq is finished the kurd are moving increasingly towards independence shia militia dominate the iraqi government iranian influence is pervasive and sunni leadership is weak and fragmented jaber know the challenge facing iraq only too well but he still cling on to hope prime minister hayder abadi is working hard to keep iraq unified salim jabouri the speaker of parliament is supportive of him a is president fuad masoum although they are weak the current incumbent of these key position appear to be working together for the good of the country'a stark contrast with the maliki era 'this is the last chance to hold iraq together jaber opined 'to make everyone think of themselves first a iraqi before sunni shia or kurd,18195.0

king because the member swear a code of silence or 'omerta ' when initiated the club ha been shrouded in mystery until now the night at the manor began at around half past nine on a cold night in february a beaten up minibus arrived at the hotel in weston on the green north oxfordshire they swaggered out tipsy from the dom p rignon they 'd enjoyed on the ride they 'd been picked up from a secret location on walton street in the oxford suburb of jericho wearing their outfit from oxford tailor ede and ravenscroft a set of club rule from found in a small blue booklet with gold embossed letter and yellowed with age describes the very same outfit they wear to this day 'the uniform of the club it say 'shall consist of a blue tie blue coat brass button buff waistcoat blue trouser oxford

this time around five hundred dollar on top of the food and drink they settled the check in cash by pm the minibus is just around the corner to drive them back into oxford to continue the night thirty year earlier a group of young men in exactly the same outfit stumbled out into the early hour of a summer 's day one of them ralph perry robinson would later describe how they decided to play a prank on another student they started throwing whatever they could find at his window while one scaled a drainpipe to try and break in but one of the group fumbled a pot plant which crashed through the window of a restaurant below the terrified student called the police and the group scampered off across nearby magdalen bridge to hide in the botanical garden three of them including a young david cameron now prime minister and boris johnson the current mayor of london and one of the favorite to replace cameron who will stand down before made their getaway down nearby queen lane the others were tracked down by sniffer dog and spent a night in the cell of cowley police station the tale wa recorded in a book of essay published the following year the oxford myth the story 's author sebastian

shakespeare said 'it 's not the done thing whenever i remind mayor boris about his time in the club he whisper 'omerta omerta ' under his breath cameron would later deny being there that night he wa ambushed by a bbc interviewer who drew uncomfortable parallel between his old club and the action of disaffected young people during the london riot for whom cameron wa demanding tough justice he claimed he had gone to bed early that night which two source there on the day claim wa 'rubbish 'there is no question cameron witnessed destruction of property one former member told the daily beast andrew gimson johnson ' biographer told me 'the bullingdon boy wanted to take greater risk they thought of themselves a an elite proud of it money and it connection it is obvious why cameron who also attended eton'britain 's most elite boarding school want to disassociate himself from such behavior while his government preaches austerity and national belt tightening his claim when he came to power wa that cut to public expenditure would affect the whole of society equally despite economic analysis to the contrary you can still buy a conservative poster that claim 'we 're all in this together the allegation made against the club is that it show there is one rule for the rich and another for everyone else two young student who said they were member of the bullingdon reinforced the point on the day cameron wa elected prime minister in dressed in suit tie and top hat while drinking champagne they unfurled a poster on an oxfordshire polling booth featuring a photo of cameron that read 'britons know your place vote eton vote tory the people duly obeyed and cameron is now in his fifth year a prime minister the bullingdon ha been an influential social institution for much longer than

marylebone cricket club which established the sport of cricket le than a decade earlier the following year they lost by run by the register record simply that 'bullingdon gave up the match by then the

but the photography company gilman and soame quickly prohibited the dissemination'alleging copyright infringement many suspect that the conservative party had a hand in this gilman and soame had no problem allowing the publication of a photo they own of then labour leader ed miliband in white tie academic dress which wa widely published just before the last election another photo on the wall of the tailor show an equally notorious image of chancellor george osborne while another previously unpublished photo from show david cameron occupying the position of club president chest puffed out and a sneering smile on his face but you can now no longer view these photo after their existence became known the tailor told me that it wa now a 'staff only bathroom ' when i asked whether the photo of the pm in the back had anything to do with this he winced slightly and replied 'well yes and no one of the bullingdon boy from that era let 's call him james agreed to meet me for lunch he greets me in a gruff antipodean accent in a caf down the road from buckingham palace with a slightly open shirt and a scraggly beard he say he doe n't want to be named because 'honestly i regret it deeply he belief he is the only member in over year to not have come from a private school over a meal of smoked salmon and black coffee james tell me about a club dinner in where the club hired a boat on which they drank armagnac a well a innumerable bottle of champagne he now ha serious misgiving about the club but described this night also attended by the 'witty charming and already ferociously ambitious young boris johnson ' a one of the most spectacular of his life the selection process he describes is simple enough a candidate must be proposed and seconded but if he is not a 'sound enough fellow ' he can be black balled the initiation rite which johnson and cameron participated in have become the stuff of legend one member told me how current member will still 'trash ' the room of the person they will initiate spraying the wall with champagne tearing photograph and cutting up mattress radek sikorski an oxford classmate of johnson in the eighty and later foreign minister of poland told gimson how he endured the ritual at the end of it he shook johnson 's hand and wa told 'congratulations man you have been chosen despite claim that these ritual were a thing of the past one member who joined recently returned to find his room trashed and a set of direction to take place a certain part of his body into the mouth of a dead pig inspired by cameron 's alleged indiscretion the number of member varies between around to and includes a president treasurer and secretary they hold three or four major event per year including the summer dinner and the buller brekker the 'brekker ' is the most licentious event of the year at the time of cameron and johnson 's membership perry robinson described one of their breakfast event in 'we always hire whores'prostitutes were paid extra by member who wanted to use them but he admitted 'there is not really much point in hiring a prostitute if you consume two bottle of champagne and 'if you have twelve friend standing around it take quite an effort of will to go for it after these event is when the notorious room smashing occurs an old article found in the archive of the oxford student newspaper ha one member recalling how they took pleasure in inviting a string band to a party before proceeding to destroy all their instrument including a priceless stradivarius violin another member at a party at l'ortolan in berkshire ate his wine glass along with his michelin starred meal a current member described similar scene except that last year 's celebration took place in a hotel in amsterdam several of those in the bullingdon this year agreed to speak off the record already they were worried about the effect of the bullingdon on their reputation 'is the story a name and shame one of them asked me the most damaging recent allegation claimed that a club member burned a note in front of a tramp 'can you make clear that this is n't true ' that kind of thing would never happen one recent member tell me while the bullingdon member have an obvious reason to want to clear their name i could n't find any evidence that this ever took place and the original article on the huffington post ha since been retracted and replaced with a note saying it wa an 'unfounded allegation ' james ha had longer to reflect on the nature of his regret 'everyone doe stupid stuff when they are young he tell me 'but the bullingdon wa different he remembered having fond memory of several fellow member but believed that the destruction wa organized wa run by a core of member including darius guppy and gottfried von bismarck who he called a 'complete sociopath one of the scariest people i 've ever met with no moral conscience whatsoever bismarck wa known in oxford for dinner in which pig head were served and became internationally notorious after olivia channon the daughter of a conservative minister at the time died after ingesting a lethal cocktail of alcohol cocaine and heroin in his christ church room james recalled one incident where a fellow club member had surreptitiously urinated in a jug of port in a college bar before calling over a waitress asking why it 'tasted off ' 'she returned a few minute later and snarled 'you people are the most disgusting people i 've ever met get out of here now ' i saw the look of disgust on her face a well a the smug grin on his and decided that i 'd had enough i never wanted anyone to look at me like that again so i got out james tell me about a culture of 'institutionalized bad behaviour where you are rewarded for getting drunk and doing a much damage a possible in almost every case they suffer no lasting consequence the bullingdon trash pub start fight and drink themselves into a coma before paying everyone off with wad of cash in the new york time reported that after a particularly destructive night the member were called in front of a proctor and 'it wa believed they were to be sent down expelled ' to the surprise of oxford the proctor only imposed a fine of each this is a recurring theme in the club 's history in tony clark a labour mp told parliament about 'a bunch of drunken toff who caused mayhem ' leaving a marquee covered in broken crockery splintered table and the body of buller men wearing tweed suit which included tom lawson son of former chancellor nigel lawson despite the fact that police arrived to deal with the party 'they let the rich kid off with a caution in landlord ian rodgers told bbc radio how a group of oxford student which included princess diana 's nephew alexander fellowes had trashed his pub during a meal 'i called the police and told them that i wanted them all prosecuted but when i called the next day they had let them all go with a fine a bullingdon member who wa there described rodgers a having 'no sense of humor in the daily mail reported that the bullingdon president nick green had allegedly assaulted his ex girlfriend 's new lover so ferociously that he wa taken to hospital green declined to give an interview he said 'nothing good can come from talking about the bullingdon he wa not asked about the alleged assault by the daily beast although the daily mail reported at the time that his lawyer had declined to comment he wa never arrested or charged perhaps the most shocking event occurred in bartholomew smith son of a former conservative mp who wa pictured next to the future

security council resolution on sunday a prisoner 'swap wa announced by tehran then confirmed by washington in which four iranian american including washington post correspondent jason rezaian were let out of iran 's prison hour later treasury imposed it measure on designated entity and individual 'involved in procurement on behalf of iran 's ballistic missile program the sanction delayed from the end of december to facilitate the prisoner swap prohibit american and others from engaging in business dealing with the named entity and individual and order u s bank to freeze their asset the u s

noting that technician from iran 's shahid hemmat industrial group 'traveled to north korea to work on an ton rocket booster being developed by the north korean government a bechtol predicts 'the iranian of course will insist that this is an 'iranian developed system ' but it is not the booster he note look like it is for the taepodong series the north 's longest range launcher or more ominously a new family of missile the taepodong missile repainted is the unha rocket rick fisher of the international assessment and strategy center told the daily beast that this launcher 'could allow iran to achieve accurate global targeting of u s and western military facility in addition to large city bechtol think it wo n't be long before the 'rocket booster 'actually the first stage of

missile cooperation but a former pentagon analyst robert collins who is based in south korea suggests pyongyang ha already figured out way around obstacle like this 'the north korean have become expert at planning alternative route for moving monies moving equipment and moving contact he told the daily beast after the treasury imposed the measure they employ 'a 'dumping peter to use paul ' system designed to circumvent anticipated sanction pyongyang ha become 'very adept at counter sanction planning henry sokolski of the nonproliferation policy education center belief sunday 's measure will not be the last a he noted in an e mail to the daily beast what is surprising is that treasury essentially admitted that it wa aware of proscribed iranian activity before both the signing on july of the joint comprehensive plan of action better known a the iranian nuclear deal and it october 'adoption day the ton booster after all is designed for a missile useful only for carrying a nuclear warhead 'the newest sanction from the treasury department prove ' without a doubt ' that the state department and the treasury department knew a the agreement with iran wa in negotiation that the north korean and iranian were cooperating on new advanced ballistic missile technology bechtol writes in fact work on the ton booster ha been publicly known for more than two year treasury 's statement declares that 'iranian missile technician had gone to north korea 'within the past several year in connection with the big booster the sanction therefore look like an afterthought and washington appears unserious if the u s really want to end the missile threat it will have to impose much more severe measure not just on iran and north korea but also on party helping them who is helping the two rogue state wikileaks released an american cable showing that chinese official despite plea from then secretary of state condoleezza rice refused to stop shipment of north korean missile part passing through the beijing capital international airport on their way to iran that wa fisher in his message to the daily beast on monday point out that chinese entity are still involved

retired fbi agent and contractor for the central intelligence agency wa notably not among them levinson wa kidnapped while working in iran in and after appearing three year later in a video and then a series photo made by his captor he ha n't been heard from since unusually the obama administration made no public statement last week calling on iran also to free levinson and there 's at least one reason for that senior official in the u s intelligence community and the administration believe that iran doe n't actually know where levinson is current and former official with knowledge of his case told the daily beast 'i think it 's nearly certain that they do n't know where he is one former official said speaking on condition of anonymity because the u s is still working with iran to find out what happened to levinson they are n't relying merely on the word of iranian official who 've said for year they do n't have information on levinson 's whereabouts or who took him intelligence that the u s ha collected on iran and government official ha helped to persuade some who 've been working to find levinson that tehran ha lost his trail'if they ever had it the conclusion among senior official that iran doe n't know how to find levinson help to explain why he wa n't part of the recent swap that ended with four american including washington post journalist jason rezaian being freed for year competing theory about what happened to levinson have only deepened the mystery surrounding his case some have speculated he wa kidnapped by organized criminal while working on a private investigation on iran 's kish island or that he wa taken by a rogue faction in the iranian security service or in the country 's revolutionary guard corp which operates with considerable autonomy the fact that some u s official now believe that the central government doe n't know where levinson is may bolster those theory brett mcgurk a top u s diplomat who worked on the prisoner 's ' release told cnn that if the u s 'knew bob levinson wa in a prison cell in iran i think you know we 'd have a different outcome here 'in fact it appears that he 's not being held in iran mcgurk added echoing statement from top administration official over the year including former secretary of state hillary clinton that levinson wa moved out of the country year ago in clinton said publicly that recent information indicated levinson wa being held 'somewhere in southwest asia in an interview last sunday with cbs ' face the nation clinton seemed to put herself in the camp with those who think levinson is either dead or beyond tehran 's reach 'i regret deeply that robert levinson wa not on his way home either clinton told host john dickerson who asked if she thought 'the iranian know where he is 'and i hope and expect that the iranian will continue to be pressed very very hard to give up any information they have and if possible to return bob levinson to his home and family the phrase 'if possible wa telling on a few level first it implied that the iranian government might not be able to say where levinson is it also suggested that he may no longer be alive u s official have said they never stopped trying to find levinson more than a year ago the obama administration opened a separate channel of discussion with iran devoted exclusively to repatriating american which ended in the prisoner swap levinson 's status 'was also central to these discussion a senior administration official told reporter on sunday 'we 've also agreed to continue a dialogue with iran through multiple channel for missing person in particular for bob levinson the official added 'and we made some progress in that case but that 's a case that we are never going to quit and never going to give up on and he 's central to our mind every single day and we 're going to continue to do everything we possibly can to find bob and bring him home but levinson 's son speaking on behalf of the missing american 's family rejected the notion that iranian official could n't locate his father and said he feared the captive wa already being forgotten 'i think it 's absolutely ridiculous to think that the iranian do n't know dan levinson told the daily beast 'he wa picked up by the iranian security force and the iranian state medium reported that ' there are people in the iranian government who know exactly where my dad is and there are people within the u s government who believe that too they tend to work in the fbi where levinson wa once an agent the current and former official said cnn reported on wednesday that fbi investigator believe levinson if he is alive is still being held in iran levinson 's son said he thought it wa plausible that top leader in the iranian government including foreign minister javad zarif and president hassan rouhani do n't know how to find levinson 'it might be other people in rogue faction of the iranian government that actually have him the younger levinson said but he insisted that the obama administration 'needs to press harder to speak to those people and to anyone else who might have information on his father levinson said he worried that if many official conclude there 's no real hope of finding his dad the momentum to finally bring him home will stall and he 'll be forgotten levinson said his family already felt neglected they only found out that u s hostage had been freed from watching news report levinson said that secretary of state john kerry had spoken to his mother last tuesday just a few day before the swap but he gave no hint of any imminent release when the family heard the news they immediately began calling their contact in the administration demanding to know why levinson wa n't among those returning to the u s 'you left him behind again my family is in tear levinson 's mother wrote to one administration official in an email that her son read to the daily beast levinson said he want the administration to use that new channel that proved so successful in freeing the four other american to help his father 'everybody 's won the only people who are suffering now are my family levinson

nonprofit organization he is also a felon convicted of bribing an israeli police general this week after exhausting what is probably his last appeal'a last ditch effort to avoid jail for health reasons'it appears he is finally headed for prison adding insult to injury a million defamation suit the rabbi 's organization filed against a reporter wa dismissed by a new york court this week for lack of jurisdiction how doe a kabbalist who by all account is indeed a devout man who practice what he preaches become a multi millionaire it 's the network in new york pinto 's close follower include leading jewish real estate magnate like ofer yardeni and charlie kushner politician like anthony wiener and eric cantor jewish leader including celebrity rabbi marc schneier and malcolm hoenlein the head of the conference of president of american jewish organization and even lebron james follower believe that pinto ha supernormal power many'including grimm'said he can read mind others say he ha the ability to bless everything from business venture to political careers'and to curse enemy a well like other kabbalist pinto speaks only hebrew is soft spoken and keep his eye partly closed the better to detach from worldly concern he dispenses advice blessing and amulet he is the descendant both of the famous moroccan mystic rabbi yisrael abuhatzeira also known a the baba sali and of rabbi haim pinto one of morocco 's most powerful rabbi and he welcome everyone religious secular jewish non jewish but for a holy man pinto is surrounded by shady criminal element including outright crook in israel these include yossi harari the head of the ramat amidar underworld gang and mobster shalom domrani in the united state they include michael grimm the former staten island congressman convicted of tax evasion and perjury pinto wa not directly implicated in grimm 's crime but his close associate were allegedly they solicited donation for grimm 's election campaign from pinto 's network of follower in excess of legally allowable amount there were also dubious character within pinto 's own organization in the jewish daily forward discovered that a top aide ben zion suky had been a pornographer then they broke the news that pinto 's israeli charity 'had spent ten of thousand on a high end hotel fine men 's clothing and jewelry among other luxury but a described in a expose by new york magazine the empire really began falling apart in when pinto 's former aide ofer biton began to turn against him with the help of high flying publicist ronn torossian torossian threatened pinto 's organization with a negative pr blitz and then began to carry it out biton extorted cash eventually both pinto and biton were working a informant meanwhile israeli authority started investigating pinto 's charity for misappropriation of fund eventually arresting ten employee that 's when pinto 's wife passed envelope full of cash to the wife of police brigadier general ephraim bracha who had been a follower in the hope that bracha would block the investigation unbeknownst to pinto bracha wa actually part of it facing year in prison pinto took a plea deal last spring and on may he received the lightest sentence permissible under law one year plus a fine one month later bracha who had been hounded by pinto 's follower committed suicide but pinto fled to

last summer he told follower 'we are playing our part in a widespread battle a holy war and in a july email he said that he hoped 'that whoever wa involved in this will ' come clean ' thus will prevent great suffering upon all the living and the dead it would be a mistake though to lump pinto in with corrupt televangelist sex offending priest and other wayward cleric pinto wa responsible for the bribes'that is now a matter of law'but he did n't give them personally and pinto 's organization clearly is filled with unsavory characters'but the rabbi himself appears to lead a modest lifestyle despite his great wealth all this make the rabbi something of an enigma it 's possible that he is a cynical svengali a manipulator pulling the string of power and confusing the credulous maybe the piety and the mysticism are all an act at the other extreme maybe pinto really is a pious unworldly figure possessed of spiritual gift but surrounded by men who take advantage of his naivet that 's probably not right either'but most likely the truth lie somewhere in between pinto 's charity have spent million of dollar on social service and lavished hundred of thousand on luxury for staff pinto himself is a mystical sage and a canny operator a the kabbalah itself teach the good is mixed in with the bad which is how a mystical rabbi can also be headed for jail,25176.0

39,9558473.0,2016-01-02T06:01:00+00:00,how famous painting got their wrong name,i sometimes think that every museum label should carry a disclaimer 'warning the title you are about to read may tell you more about the historical reception of the painting than it doe about the painting itself google 'rembrandt and 'philosopher for instance and the first thing you will see on your screen is the image of a painting that now hang in the louvre the painting which is titled philosophe en m ditation philosopher in meditation and dated show an old bearded man seated in an interior with a large open book on the table beside him golden light from a window illuminates his figure while the rest of the interior is plunged in shadow to his right is a winding stair that disappears into a dark recess and the bent form of an old woman tending a fire though you wo n't be able to see it on the screen the indistinct form of another woman is also disappearing up the stair ever since this painting arrived at the louvre at the end of the eighteenth century commentator have been tempted to associate it 'philosophe with the contemplative artist who created him one nineteenth century french poet simply decided that rembrandt wa the philosopher another saw 'the very genius of rembrandt in the figure and attributed the picture a a whole to the artist 's wish for 'an interior in which to house his mysterious thought in the mid twentieth century the writer and philosopher aldous huxley described the painting 's 'symbolical subject matter a 'nothing more nor le than the human mind itself rembrandt however had nothing to do with naming his picture like many painting from the dutch golden age this one owes it title to a reproductive printmaker who engraved the image for popular consumption more than a century after the artist painted it this particular printmaker may in turn have taken his cue from a french owner of the painting who wa already calling it and a companion piece then also attributed to rembrandt his 'deux philosophes several year before both picture were engraved in once the print began to circulate the title stuck to the painting too but the philosopher these men thought they saw in rembrandt 's picture is almost certainly their invention'a product of their own enlightenment era when 'philosophes flourished rather than the creation of the artist among other reason for doubting the title i am sorry to report is that woman bending over the fire there is apparently no iconographical tradition of philosopher accompanied by woman though her presence ha prompted one knowledgeable commentator to associate the picture with the relatively obscure biblical story of tobit and his wife anna the exact subject of rembrandt 's painting remains a mystery meanwhile it continues to be known'and therefore generally understood'as his philosopher in meditation we are probably indebted to the printmaker for the idea that a picture should have a title in the first place among the most successful of these reproductive artist wa a german engraver based in paris named jean george wille whose magnificent print circulated throughout europe in the late eighteenth and nineteenth century wille earned particular fame for his reproduction of seventeenth century dutch genre paintings'those picture of everyday life that still draw crowd to modern museums'and perhaps his most celebrated image wa a print after gerard ter borch that he called l'instruction paternelle or the paternal admonition a it is usually translated in english we know that this title wa wille 's rather than the painter 's from a diary kept by the printmaker so famous did this particular print become that a half century later goethe wa still inquiring rhetorically 'who doe not know wille 's magnificent copper engraving of this painting ter borch 's picture show three figure in an interior a young woman dressed in white satin and standing with her back to u a seated man who raise his hand in a gesture that wille apparently took a a sign of warning or correction and an older woman also seated who face the viewer a she sip from a wine glass the picture wa painted around wille engraved and titled it more than a century later and so suggestive did that title prove that goethe could spin an entire small narrative from it cue in one of his own most important work the novel elective affinity goethe 's character act out a tableau vivant based on wille 's print a noble knight sits with crossed foot evidently severely lecturing his daughter who face him ' s he can only be seen from the back but her whole posture seems to indicate that she is controlling herself the expression and gesture of the father tell u however that his reproof is not too violent or humiliating and the mother seems to hide a slight embarrassment while she gaze into the glass of wine she is about to sip this little story had it own afterlife when the future novelist george eliot toured the berlin museum in she recorded in her journal how 'pleased she wa to 'recognize among the picture the one goethe had described in his novel 'it is the daughter being reproved by her father while the mother is emptying her wine glass she wa looking at the berlin original but her memory for it titular narrative wa evidently stronger than her recall of the painter himself since the same journal entry attribute the picture in question to another dutch artist jan steen the trouble of course is that we have no way of knowing whether ter borch had anything like wille 's instructive scenario in mind the painting exists in two versions'the one in berlin and another at the rijksmuseum in amsterdam by the middle of the twentieth century the scholarly consensus had shifted the scene from a domestic interior to an upscale brothel a the standing figure morphed into a courtesan while her erstwhile parent turned respectively into a would be client and his wine sipping procuress this more salacious reading appeared to receive further reinforcement when the cleaning of the berlin picture revealed to some eye the trace of a coin in the gentleman 's hand rather than a gesture of admonition the hand wa apparently engaged in offering payment for sexual service about to be rendered so much it would seem for wille 's edifying image of family life in the dutch golden age unhappily for the brothel theory however that coin ha since been pronounced a phantom recent commentator on the painting generally agree that the original meaning of the scene remains elusive but museum and catalog still require a title when i last checked the rijksmuseum had chosen to call it version the gallant conversation followed in parenthesis by the phrase 'known a the paternal admonition at berlin the picture continued to go by the name wille gave it by the nineteenth century most viewer seem to have taken for granted both that painting had title and that artist supplied them yet then a now many painter continued to leave the naming of their work to others we still do n't know whether any of paul c zanne 's title for example originated with the artist his influential dealer ambroise vollard tell an amusing story of one early picture a landscape with some female nude and 'a person who from his getup could be taken for a shepherd in the course of arranging for a show he accidentally placed the canvas in a frame that still bore the legend from a previous picture c zanne 's painting wa thus inadvertently baptized diana and acteon'and interpreted accordingly one critic even praised 'the nobility of the goddess 's attitude and the modest air of the virgin who surrounded her a the chaste company indignantly repelled the spying acteon sometime later the same dealer wa asked to lend a temptation of saint anthony by c zanne to another exhibit unfortunately for the exhibiters the painting vollard had promised them had been sold in the interim but he still had custody of the other picture which he mischievously sent on instead this time there were no word on the frame but since the exhibiters were expecting a temptation of saint anthony that 's how it wa listed in the catalog where one critic had seen the chaste diana another now spotted 'the smile at once bewitching and perfidious of a daughter of satan the indignant gesture of the goddess 's attendant now turned into 'a seductive invitation while 'the pseudo acteon became a 'moving saint anthony a collector who had previously refused the supposed diana and acteon because he already owned a painting of the subject by another artist now triumphantly announced his purchase of the rejected canvas under it new name 'it ha a striking realism he boasted c zanne himself on the other hand denied that his painting had any subject at all 'i merely tried to render certain movement the artist protested when he learned of these titular adventure reading by the title a i call this process of seeing what it tell you to see is not limited to picture of the human figure one of my favorite story concern an abstract expressionist painting by jackson pollock that now hang in the metropolitan museum of art in new york the painting is entitled pasipha after the mythical queen who cuckolded king minos with a bull and gave birth to the minotaur taking his cue from the title a future director of painting and sculpture at moma associated the painting 's 'energetic motif with 'sexual abandon 'physical ecstasy and 'animal passion the poet and art critic frank o'hara identified the picture with 'the amorous nature of bestiality and saw in it 'the stark staring and foreboding figure of pasipha ' with her foreknowledge of the minotaur and her lust but what are we to make of such vision once we learn that 'pasipha wa not pollock 's title at all but the belated suggestion of a curator at moma who offered it a a substitute when the artist 's patron peggy guggenheim objected to his original choice of 'moby dick 'who the hell is pasipha pollock is said to have responded and many viewer may still share his bewilderment yet pollock also accepted the title and for more than a half century his canvas ha continued to be known a pasipha at what point if any might those of u with a taste for ancient myth be justified in thinking of the lustful queen when we look at his painting ruth bernard yeazell

black fruit in a full bodied cabernet say or that dance between earth and bright fruit and floral note in a good pinot noir but bourbon for most of our life it seemed that one could count the flavor note of kentucky 's favorite spirit on one hand maybe two burnt caramel oak vanilla maybe a few others these day it 's another story entirely top end bourbon can boast over one hundred flavor point woodford reserve one of the most complex and balanced bourbon ever made ha over two hundred individual flavor point for the folk who make it helping you sort out all those flavors'the blackberry from the rose petal the anise from the black pepper'is a simple a well inventing the wheel 'as a student of our industry i had long admired the flavor wheel published by the wine brewing and scotch whiskey industry say chris morris master distiller at woodford reserve distillery 'but i wa shocked that our industry did not have a flavor wheel sometime around i developed one for bourbon based on good science and laboratory analysis of many bourbon in an attempt to give people a window into an entire range of bourbon flavor morris 's innovation wa immediately embraced across the bourbon industry which wa in the midst of a kind of revolution of refinement 'you know when you are tasting a flavor but you ca n't quite put your finger on what it is say tom fischer founder of bourbonblog com 'the flavor wheel help u put it into word the woodford reserve flavor wheel is a balanced a the whiskey itself with five primary spoke representing the five area of flavor in bourbon wood grain sweet aromatics spice and fruit floral within each of those section there are a dozen or more individual congener such a blackberry walnut pecan butterscotch cinnamon and clove why are n't all plus flavor point that can been discerned in woodford reserve included well for starter it 's a flavor wheel not an eye chart 'if i put all two hundred on there you would n't be able to read the thing say morris plus 'a lot of them have chemical name that can be confusing for the average consumer at first morris figured that his flavor wheel'available for free from the itunes app store'would have little application beyond academic setting and the occasional tasting then along with woodford reserve 's james beard award nominated chef in residence ouita michel morris devised an ingenious way of opening up this world of flavor to the general public by pairing woodford 's bourbon and rye with food that naturally accentuate the spirit ' individual flavor the bourbon and food pairing are something the woodford reserve folk feature in their woodford county kentucky distillery but can easily be recreated at home a chunk of parmigiano reggiano will bring out the spice character a well a several wood note a few sweetened dried cranberry take you down a path of florals fruit and ester toasted hazelnut wake up the wood and nut flavor dark chocolate call up both spice and the sweet aromatics a bite of orange brings out even more fruit while a little bit of kentucky sorghum pull up yet another aspect of the bourbon 's wood character 'people are surprised by the fact that with the prompting of the wheel and the food they can really taste the complexity of the bourbon and become a kind of miniature expert say morris 'i do n't think many people have on the top of their mind that a bourbon can be a fruity and spicy a woodford is that is a real revelation for most people just like you can trace your family 's impressive cheekbone to your great grandma june 's side of the family each one of those flavor point can be connected back to a single element or combination of element employed in the unique process of crafting woodford reserve that blackberry flavor thank the fact that the crew at woodford reserve outdoor age the white oak it us in the barrel they make in their cooperage those apple note that register especially strongly in the nose come primarily from fermentation and are further developed and evolved during the bourbon 's unique in the industry heat cycled maturation process similarly those caramel flavor can be sourced first to malt used a part of the mash along with corn and rye and then to it aging inbuilt to specification toasted and then charred white oak barrel the higher than industry average content of rye in the mash is responsible for most of woodford reserve 's spice character ask any bourbon expert what make woodford reserve such a singular experience and they will tell you that it 's not merely the sheer number of flavor but the way they balance together so perfectly 'woodford ha some signature characteristic that are all it own say bourbonblog com 's fischer who host bourbon tasting throughout the country 'it 's a bourbon that if you put it in a blind tasting you can almost always identify it because it is so singular there is a really caramel spicy and very luscious flavor to it it is wonderfully unique experience and that ha everything to do with the way that they make it,17951.0

they stared at their phone instead of their kid did they monitor their instagram and facebook account for duration spent online instead of interacting with their child did the study deal with human being whatsoever no it dealt with rat more specifically it dealt with rat that were born into specially designed environment where resource for proper nesting were deliberately made scarce it turn out the mother rat in those environment were distracted by their insufficient resource and their baby did n't get a much attention from them compared to rat raised in normal environment those attention deprived rat seemed to enjoy pleasurable thing such a sugar and playing le than peer could this study be an interesting insight into the working of rat brain sure doe it surprise me to learn that rat raised by mother stressed by a lack of resource would have some kind of negative long term effect not in the least what doe the study actually say about human parent and cellphone use not a goddamn thing however if you pirouette out into all manner of extrapolation and conjecture you can come up with all sort of eye catching conclusion could one use a broad definition like 'distraction to describe both one 's android use and a rat 's desperately searching for material to keep it baby warm yes i suppose one could and it seems that 's all the similarity necessary to apply conclusion from the latter to human being doing the former the effect of 'distracted parenting come up from time to time in the news hell i 've written about my own frustration with parent who spend more time staring at their iphones during visit than they do talking with me it 's merely my own suspicion with nary a study design to back it up but i suspect it 's better for child to have their parent ' undivided attention on a consistent basis but that conclusion rest on my own common sense and experience a a parent rather than wildly misapplied finding from research on lab rodent scientist are human being and like all people who work hard at something want that work to get visibility hence promoting their finding in such a manner a to attract the most attention like suggesting they may have implication for parent who use cellphone but press material about a study deserve just a much skepticism a those from a movie studio or politician 's office failing to question whether rat behavior in a cage have anything useful to tell u about something a enormously complex and nuanced a human childrearing is egregious should every study that draw conclusion from animal study by discarded out of hand no but neither should they be presented a telling everyone what 'science writ large show about something even under the best of circumstance for my own part i suspect i 'm a guilty a anyone of being more distracted than i ought by my own cellphone there 's always something trending and i get beguiled too my new year 's resolution wa to leave my smart phone on the shelf more often in fact but rat have nothing to do with my medium habit and they have nothing to do with yours either,3425.0

that i sat at the table in deep and melancholy thought and reflection that the weight of a big heavy hickory cane came plump across my knuckle for handing the man next to me a piece of meat which i did not want after i got back to the shop the keeper called me up before him which i did no more care about than if i had never stood before him before for i began to get use to his call and ask me if i certainly meant to break over and run through those bright and golden rule of his i tried to make some excuse for breaking over that rule i tried to find a mantle to cover the deed but all in vain i had broken the rule and forgotten the advice of mr tylor and now i wa arraigned and stood convicted and must suffer the penalty of it by suffering under the bending and biting gall of the old cat and be lock up in the dungeon until the next morning never will i forget that bright and palmy day of july a i wa strolling to the hospital that i overtook mill who had been an inmate with me in the house of refuge and fell in a conversation with him until one of the relief officer stepped up to u and ask u our name and the name of the shop that we belong to on my returning back to the shop from the hospital i found that the relief keeper had caught u a talking and had reported u to our respected keeper for talking the keeper called me up to his desk and ask me who that young chap wa that i wa talking to and what we wa talking about 'i see said the officer 'that you do n't try nor mean to get along here without suffering under the lash every day what to do with you i know not without it is to whip you to death right on the spot while the keeper wa talking to me esq cook the warden of the prison came through the shop and the keeper took him one side and whispered something into his ear about me they held a long conversation about me for some minute while i stood with my face towards the desk after they had got through with there their conversation esq cook took his seat behind the keeper 's desk and in a rash and an ugly tone the keeper called me in the presence of esq cook and said 'this boy esq is becoming a harden convict he is listening to the silly tale and counsel of the older inmate and following their devilish vice and learning all the iniquity and misery that is prevailing within the prison he is letting these older inmate have their influence over him and learning to play their mean and devilish trick and what to do with him i know not i have whip him until the blood came streaming from his back and it appears to have no effect upon the boy at all what to do with him sir i can not tell i am tired of throwing the lash upon his back he is a smart boy and seems to be endown with good reason and factuality and if i let him lead the course that he is now a leading he will surely become an harden convict and one day or another will be loaded down with heavy ball and chain and become the inmate of a dark and a gloomy dungeon what shall i do with him esq i know no other way to do only to put him over into your hand and into your hand i now place the harden youth take him and act out your own pleasure with him the reader must have some idea of the feeling of my mind during that conversation of the warden 's and the keeper there i stood a nothing but a mere boy before two officer a weeping and cry horror horror horror eternal horror of horror came beating and pealting upon my mind 'you say said esq cook to the officer who stood with the cat in his hand 'that you do n't know what to do with yon boy 'no sir the officer replied 'it wa only yesterday that i gave him a severe punishment and now i give the youth over into your hand that he may pas through hard and rough treatment a the officer said these word esq cook ask him what kind of treatment i had been through besides the cat 'have you consign him in solitary confinement yet 'yes sir said the officer 'i have consign him away to a dark and a gloomy dungeon and fed him on bread and water once a day and it ha had no effect upon the boy at all and if he is allowed to go on in the path which he is now treading he will be the ringleader of all the vice and crime that are prevailing within the wall of a gloomy prison 'into your hand said esq cook 'will i commend yon boy see that you go under a hard and rough treatment with him first with the cat then after that give him over into my hand and i 'll see what virtue there is in the stock then if he keep on leading the career that he now lead the crack of the pistol shall prove his destiny a esq cook said these word the officer ordered me to pull off my shirt i obeyed his authority and took off my shirt and he sunk forty and two blow into my back with the cat after i had put on my shirt esq cook ordered me to follow him like a dog with his tail hanging down to the ground did i follow this venerable gentleman whose gray hair i honor and respect to this very day pressing his way onward he led me to the south wing and enclosed me in a large box which they called the stock and made my hand foot and head fast so a i could not stir my body at all these stock when closed and made fast are a dark and black a midnight it benumbs the hand and foot and stop the circulation of the blood for a long time not a spark or one single ray of light is there to be seen until the officer see fit to open the door and let his captive free it wa late in the afternoon when i heard the heavy tramp of two officer making their way to the box where i wa consign the heavy weight of their cane coming down upon the floor seemed to tell me that they wa the very one who had consign me to the stock a they approach this box of torture they unlock the door and made my hand and foot free from torture and pain and ordered me back to the shop slowly and sadly did i pace my way back to the shop in a pensive manner while the keeper kept close up at my heel with a big hickory cane in his hand the reader must imagine to himself how i felt and the pain i wa under goin ' and bearing after goin ' through this treatment of punishment you must remember that i felt weary and faint and wa glad enough to lay my head down upon the cold floor a soon a i entered my cell and though it wa strictly against the rule for the convict to swing his hammock before the bell rung at eight o'clock for him to turn in yet so faint and exhausted wa i that i swung my bed just a soon a i entered my cell the night guard came along and look into my cell and found me covered up in bed 'haloo here said he 'come up here to the door sir i got up on my hand and knee and creep to the door a well a i could suffering with pain at every inch i moved 'who told you to go to bed sir said the guard 'who gave you permission sir do n't you know that it is against the rule for you to swing your hammock 'sir said i 'the pain and suffering which i have endured this day ha caused me to break over this rule 'do n't care said he 'if a man is breathing his last breath of life he is no business to break over the rule and go to bed without permission get up sir and put on your clothes in vain did i try to reason and expostulate with the hard and cold hearted devil but all of my tear and begging and reasoning and rough and cruel treatment could n't make any effect on this cold hearted devil 's heart but went right off and got the key of my cell door and unlock it and ordered me to follow him down stair pensively and slowly did i follow the demon down stair while the cold clod of blood still clung to my back groping my way down the stair he led me out into the kitchen and order me to pull off my shirt i strip myself and turned my back around towards the cruel hearted guard and all the mark and blood that came oozing from my back could

murder of teresa halbach a year old photographer whose charred remains are discovered at the avery salvage yard from the very moment he 's arrested avery claim that the manitowoc sheriff 's department is framing him for the crime and during the subsequent trial a number of suspicious finding are brought to light suggesting he may be right from a phantom car key to a vial of avery 's blood in an evidence locker that appeared to be tampered with to the extra jurisdictional involvement of several manitowoc policeman connected with avery 's previous case and pending lawsuit what you did n't see during avery 's trial sequence wa his lawyer mentioning any other suspect besides brandon dassey in the murder of halbach that 's because prior to the trial avery 's defense team attempted to introduce evidence that other person may have murdered halbach later on january avery notified the court of his intent to pursue third party liability maintaining his innocence and stating that 'several member of avery 's extended family a well a customer were on the avery salvage yard property during the approximate time that teresa halbach likely wa there may be responsible for her murder the state ultimately denied his request citing the precedent established in state v denny wherein the court adopted a 'legitimate tendency test for third party liability evidence the wisconsin supreme court defines this 'legitimate tendency test a follows third party defense evidence may be admissible under the legitimate tendency test if the defendant can show that the third party had the motive and the opportunity to commit the charged crime and can provide some evidence to directly connect the third person to the crime charged which is not remote in time place or circumstance the court deemed the introduction of any other suspect inadmissible 'because the defendant doe not contend any of the other person present at the avery property on october had a motive to murder teresa halbach or commit the other crime alleged to have been committed against her avery wa ultimately found guilty of murdering halbach not guilty of mutilating her corpse and guilty of the illegal possession of a

four suspect who he believed may be responsible for the murder of halbach here is the evidence that avery presented scott tadych at the time of halbach 's murder the mustachioed tadych wa dating barb janda the sister of steven avery who lived next door to him they 're now married janda is the mother of bobby blaine bryan and brendan dassey in the series tadych delivers a strange statement to the press the day after avery 's conviction saying 'what happened yesterday is the best thing in the world adding 'he got what he got comin ' to him according to avery 's court filing tadych 's 'previous experience with the court system show him to be a violent and impulsive person particularly towards woman in manitowoc county charged him with criminal trespass and battery with the complaint alleging that tadych visited the home of constance welnetz at a m knocking on her bedroom window welnetz wa asleep with a man named martin leclair and a she called the police tadych is alleged to have walked

the avery salvage yard property twice on october the day halbach wa murdered and it wa barb janda 's van that halbach had come to photograph so 'barb and likely tadych knew m halbach would be coming to the yard to photograph the van what 's more tadych 's only alibi is bobby dassey who is now tadych 's stepson in fact they 're mutual alibi in the case claiming each saw the other while driving on their way to hunt and that according to the avery filing 'no one else can vouch for their whereabouts during that afternoon what 's more according to avery 's court filing which cited a calumet county sheriff 's department report a co worker of tadych 's 'reported that tadych had approached him to sell him a rifle that belonged to one of the dassey boy and a rifle is believed to be the weapon that killed halbach also a co worker stated to the calumet county sheriff 's department that tadych 'had left work on the day that steven avery wa arrested and that he wa a 'nervous wreck ' when he left also another co worker allegedly overheard tadych saying that 'one of the dassey boy had blood on his clothes and that the clothes 'had gotten mixed up with his laundry ' bobby dassey bobby dassey is

trailer and that avery had on nov jokingly 'asked u if he wanted ' he wanted u to help him get rid of the body according to avery 's attorney dean strang this wa 'false testimony since the joke wa allegedly made on nov after halbach 's body wa found on nov according to avery 's court filing 'if bobby 's brother brendan or his soon to be stepfather scott tadych were involved in the crime bobby would have had motive to frame mr avery for the crime also bobby reportedly did n't like avery stating to the calumet county sheriff 's department that avery 'would lie in order to 'stab ya in the back ' and that steven had done this to him in the past further bobby wa home at the time halbach wa on the avery salvage yard property and admitted to seeing halbach a he looked outside the window of his home on the property bobby 's movement on the day halbach is said to have been murdered october struck avery a 'suspicious 'he claimed to have gone hunting after seeing m halbach on the property and said that scott tadych would say that he and scott passed each other on the highway on the way to hunting read avery 's court filing citing a calumet county sheriff 's department report 'strangely bobby told police that tadych 'would be able to verify precisely what time he had seen bobby ' he did not explain why that time would be so important that tadych would be able to tell the police precisely what time they had seen each other avery 's court filing also found it odd that bobby said he 'd showered before he went hunting and that his mother barb janda told police that bobby had also showered after he went hunting and citing a division of criminal investigation dci report 'a physical examination of bobby showed that he had scratch on his back he told law enforcement that the scratch were from a puppy the examining physician stated that the scratch looked recent and that it wa unlikely they were over a week old charles avery steven avery 's older brother charles avery is seen in the series guiding detective and filmmaker along the avery salvage yard property according to avery 's court filing charles avery 'also potentially had the motive to kill teresa halbach in charles wa charged with the sexual assault of his then wife donna the complaint alleged that charles 'held donna down and had sexual intercourse with her against her will and that he 'd 'tried to strangle her with a phone cord and told her that 'if she did not shut up he would end it all ' he 'd also allegedly had 'an aggressive history with customer at avery salvage yard including zina lavora a woman who told the calumet county sheriff 's department that charles 'began sending her flower and repeatedly asking her to go out on date which she found to be disturbing he 'd left a gift at her door and called her repeatedly over several week with lavora telling coworkers she wa 'afraid of him avery 's court filing also cited 'jealousy for steven over money a share of the family business and over jodi stachowski steven 's then girlfriend citing a dci report upon steven 's return from prison for his false conviction 'what looked like a half share in the family business wa likely to be a third share with steven 's arrival and that charles 's daughter carla avery told police charles 'puts up with steven working at the yard but that he doe n't really want him to work there and since steven wa set to be paid a lot of money from the state for his false conviction the filing say this 'money may have caused jealousy to charles and that charles 'may even have believed that if steven were again sent to prison his lawsuit proceeds might go to him and the other avery family member a for jodi stachowski the filing say charles 'frightened her while in jail jodi had told another woman she wa scared of charles and according to a dci report shortly after jodi and steven began dating charles 'had come over to steven 's home with a shotgun because he wa angry that they were dating stachowski even told her friend that she 'was freaked out by chuckie and had once awoken to find him in her home she 'd shared with steven avery 's filing further claimed charles 'had opportunity to kill m halbach in addition to being on the avery property according to a calumet county sheriff 's department report robert fabian told police that charles asked steven 'if the photographer had arrived yet on october charles 's trailer is also the closest of any of the residence on the avery salvage yard property to where halbach 's car wa found and that 'anyone driving her car down to where it wa ultimately found would have driven past charles ' trailer charles also according to the filing told police that he lived alone and saw no one on the night of october so wa sans alibi and 'had a mean to frame steven after steven cut his finger the filing say 'charles could have smeared steven 's blood from a rag in m halbach 's car he could have planted the key in steven 's room getting rid of steven would only improve charles ' situation at avery salvage yard earl avery steven avery 's younger brother earl avery doe n't garner much screen time in making a murderer he 's mentioned briefly on a title card stating that on saturday november earl wa running the business and gave volunteer searcher pamela and nikole sturm permission to search the yard where they later found halbach 's rav vehicle according to avery 's court filing 'much of the same evidence relevant to charles avery would apply to earl avery a well including that his share of the business would have also gone from one half to one third upon steven 's return earl had also according to a calumet county sheriff 's department report told police 'even if my brother did something i would tell which avery 's filing say expressed 'his willingness to give information incriminating to steven and earl allegedly knew halbach wa coming to the yard on october on behalf of auto trader magazine like tadych and charles avery earl also had a troubled past with woman back in according to avery 's court filing the state charged earl with 'sexually assaulting his two daughter and avery 's filing suggests earl 'had the mean to kill teresa halbach since he and pal robert fabian would hunt for rabbit on the avery salvage yard ground and that they were allegedly riding around on the property in a golf cart hunting rabbit the day halbach disappeared avery 's court filing cite a calumet county sheriff 's department report and a dci report stating that earl admitted driving his golf cart past where halbach 's car wa found and even though fabian said earl claimed he knew every single car on the lot earl 'claimed he did not see m halbach 's car also 'a cadaver dog alerted on a golf cart parked in a small garage behind the main residence on the salvage yard property what 's more according to a calumet 's county sheriff 's department report cited in avery 's filing earl 'hid from police when they came to take a dna sample on november when the investigator went to his home he hid in an upstairs bedroom under some clothes avery 's court filing concluded with 'in sum the court should have allowed mr avery to introduce evidence and argue from that evidence that other person could have been responsible for the murder of m halbach namely scott tadych charles or earl avery or bobby dassey,1020206.0

the anti syrian phalangist to embrace damascus in samaha came to be an intimate confidant of both president hafez al assad and his son and successor bashar valued especially for his western connection he wa credited with helping arrange the latter 's state visit in to attend bastille day festivity in paris a the esteemed guest of president sarkozy the story go that even after lebanon 's own presidential entourage turned up the same week in paris samaha remained with the syrian delegation compounding the magnitude of his arrest wa the law of public life in lebanon which hold that those who displease the assads appreciably reduce their chance of dying a natural death this long observed statistical phenomenon dating back at least to the assassination of leftist leader kamal jumblatt wa particularly noticeable in the run up to and aftermath of the syrian army 's forced withdrawal from lebanon in 'itself prompted by the enormous car bomb on valentine 's day of that year which obliterated the prime minister rafiq al hariri along with others from to the present day at least eleven high profile foe of damascus have perished by the same or similar mean while four survived assassination attempt with grave wound among the victim wa brig gen wissam al hassan head of the very police unit that busted samaha slain by a car bomb outside what he thought wa a 'safe ' house two month after samaha 's arrest though few were ever in doubt a to who stood behind this gruesome liquidation campaign evidence of incontestable concreteness could never quite be procured the capture in flagrante of so symbolic a personage a samaha'seen telling the police informant on camera 'there are only two people who know about the plan 'ali mamluk director of syria 's national security bureau and the president 'looked for a moment like it might change that instead his release ha only brought home how very little ha changed in the last decade mp marwan hamade wa the first of the batch to be targeted in when a mercedes exploded a he drove past it just off beirut 's iconic corniche that only one of the three in the car'police escort sergeant ghazi bou karoum'lost his life wa considered a lucky escape a nicholas blanford document in his book killing mr lebanon the year old hamade broke all of his rib a well a his foot needed stitch in his head suffered brain hemorrhage and burn and took the best part of a year to recover a he recounted in while testifying at the special tribunal for lebanon stl established in the hague to investigate hariri 's assassination syria 's military intelligence chief in lebanon rustom ghazaleh hastily ordered the police investigation into hamade 's case closed on the ground that responsibility had to lie either with israel or hamade himself speaking to the daily beast about samaha 's release hamade said it only reaffirmed his gratitude for being included among the auxiliary case falling under the stl 's mandate even if no indictment ha yet been issued in the hague 'i said to myself 'well we did well to fight to get a special tribunal on lebanon because even if it 's a slow paced operation at least we 're not under the pressure of local interest and hezbollah or the syrian ' ' at least i know the judge sitting in the hague are not under the pressure of those sitting in lebanon unfortunately for most such victim and their relative however only two other case have thus far been deemed by the stl to meet it jurisdiction criterion the assassination of mohammed chatah an international monetary fund economist who later served a u ambassador and minister of finance on december wa one of the majority that do not though a so often lebanese authority have failed to identify any possible culprit chatah 's link to the anti syrian 'march political coalition led most in the general public to suspect the usuals when the daily beast asked chatah 's son year old tech entrepreneur omar how he had received samaha 's release he described it a 'a punch in the gut 'the diligence with which brig gen hassan the late mastermind of the samaha bust went about catching samaha with audio and video recording wa unparalleled in the history of lebanon said chatah 'hassan and the people around him in the police worked tirelessly to do this the right way and despite the overwhelming evidence and clear security threat he pose the judge released him on bail that capriciousness of injustice is scary when you consider how it ha permeated our institution and government at the same time chatah echoed the feeling of impotence and despair expressed by countless lebanese in private conversation recalling that while he admired the young demonstrator protesting outside samaha 's residence and elsewhere in the country since his release a sense of futility stopped him from joining them 'i feel helpless when we demonstrate nobody listens when we applaud responsible people for conducting thorough investigation and lawful arrest they are killed when we put our faith in the judge and court they show total disregard for the law i am beyond disappointed it 's like we have come to expect this capriciousness it 's the banality of injustice we are so jaded a a country that when a murderer is so obviously caught red handed it just slide by above all chatah described samaha 's release a the loss of perhaps the last chance to obtain some modicum of justice for the long series of unpunished bombing from that of hamade through hariri to 'my father and many others in between ' the arrest of samaha wa important because it wa done through thorough investigation through public institution and best of all it wa preempted no one had to die said chatah 'personally if justice institutional justice can be meted out for just one of the people assassinated just once i will feel a little better i will sleep a little bit better at night adding to the bitter taste for many is hezbollah who is normally excellent at keeping a grudge but ha pronounced it high time to put the episode to bed and essentially asked what the fuss wa about anyway 'there wa no longer any legal justification for samaha 's detention to continue said mp muhammad raad head of hezbollah 's parliamentary bloc those objecting to his release were mere rabble rouser guilty of 'petulance and 'maliciousness raad 's remark were ridiculed by tv satirist nadim koteich who with a mock shrug mimicked 'four year is enough what did the guy do moved explosive from syria commissioned by a foreign state to blow them up in his country and kill people what 's the issue koteich had to change his filming location after receiving death threat in 'readers may perhaps perceive an emerging pattern yet beyond hezbollah alone is the broader realization that rather than the day of assad 's hold over lebanon fading into the past'as so many had hoped in and then again in 'they are if anything looming ever larger in the future looking beyond lebanon 's frontier which is where most of beirut 's vital politics are decided those lebanese aspiring for a genuinely sovereign and independent nation have fewer reason than ever for optimism that the iran deal is likely to strengthen hezbollah is a fact admitted even by it chief architect and defender president obama thanks to iranian and now russian intervention to support assad militarily a well a a gradual but unmistakable american abandonment of it assad must go policy the autocrat secretary of state john kerry once compared to hitler ha n't looked so comfortably seated in half a decade those reading the wind have already started to act last monday one of lebanon 's last anti assad hawk samir geagea stunned supporter and critic alike by officially endorsing his mortal foe of three decade hezbollah ally michel aoun for president this need n't mean lebanon is wholly lost to syrian hegemony all over again for one thing various powerbroker including the country 's main sunni party are rigidly aligned against aoun 's candidacy it doe mean however that when samaha told reporter in his living room upon his release that he plan now to continue his prior 'political work and activity there is no obvious reason for anyone not to take his word with the absolute and utmost seriousness,7736.0

400,9787489.0,2016-01-10T05:15:00+00:00,tom stoppard i want to be like verdi,sir tom stoppard doe not merely talk in complete sentence he talk in complete paragraph in the interview below he say that dialogue is his strong suit and he 's talking about playwriting but listening to him it 's clear from whom his character have inherited their often terrifying lucidity so talking to this fearsomely articulate man can be a little daunting and would be even more were he not so unfailingly polite and even kind ask him an awkwardly worded question and he instinctively helpfully offer you a much better answer to the question you should have asked in our conversation there wa even a moment that seemed to leap right out of a stoppard play when at one point he broke off in mid sentence the silence grew louder and louder for about second at which point he finally asked 'am i pausing for you or are you pausing for me the occasion for the interview is the re release on blu ray of the film version of rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead which stoppard not only adapted from his own play but directed a well this play while not his first wa the one that overnight elevated him to the highest rank a a dramatist a perch from which he ha never fallen the story of two hilariously feckless minor character in hamlet rosencrantz and guildenstern showcased stoppard 's felicity for comedy and verbal felicity if it take a playwright with unimaginable brass to put his dialogue side by side with shakespeare 's the scene with character from hamlet use the bard 's dialogue it take a genius to pull it off but pull it off stoppard did since that audacious opening stoppard ha gone on to win every award imaginable for his subsequent theater work and his screenplay including an oscar for his screenplay co written with marc norman for shakespeare in love more tellingly perhaps his work have never ceased to be performed someone somewhere is always mounting a new production of jumper or travesty or arcadia and repeated viewing always show you something new stoppard 's play even the old one never fail to come alive again on stage rosencrantz and guildenstern is the only film he ha ever directed and when it opened it wa better received in europe where it famously beat goodfellas for the golden lion award at the venice film festival the american reception wa more mixed but year later it is hard to see why anyone complained the film is funny engaging lovingly produced and tim roth and gary oldman both deliver standard setting performance in the title role at stoppard show few sign of slowing down although a couple of year ago he did leave london and moved to the dorset countryside 'i just wa n't getting any work done in london somehow he said 'so that 's dorset where we live yeah we 're about mile from town which enables me to say no to thing that i otherwise might have to do if i were in london he spoke by phone to the daily beast from his home are you pleased with the new blu ray version of rosencrantz and guildenstern i 'm very pleased producer michael brandman ha performed a minor miracle the film wa in the coil of a company that ha ceased to exist i never expected it to re emerge really i do n't really get what blu ray mean i do get that it 's better in some way'crisper clearer but i 'm not technologically minded so whatever it mean i 'm in favor are there difference between the play and the movie i think that 's the underlying reason why i ended up directing it somehow i wa the only person a it were who would n't try to defend it from the moviemaker it 's not terribly different from the play at the same time it 's enormously different if you compare dialogue against dialogue it 's not that much different but a a film it just produce a large number of completely different kind of image with the play you 're looking at the same icon'the same moving talking picture a movie of any play ha to liberate itself from being a camera in the middle of row h that 's clearly the first step but the larger step which i think it needed me to take wa to treat the original with irreverence rather than reverence and my name on the film made it easier to raise what wa in any event a modest amount of money i 've said this before but i feel that the thinking wa that since i 'd never made a film i might turn out to be incredibly brilliant at it whereas if i had made a film one would know that i wa n't so while i wa an unknown quantity the possibility were infinite and to use a madison avenue word i think there wa something sexy about the writer director idea that it wa actually one person 's film rather than a film by somebody using somebody else 's work we ended up in croatia mostly and slovenia and i think we probably shot a far a i can recall for day or something like that and then brought it all home and looked at it it wa a very enjoyable process i said this at a journalist 's lunch once and my comment morphed into my saying it wa 'easy rather than 'enjoyable i did n't find it easy at the same time i have to say that because i had the sense to talk a lot to peter biziou who wa the lighting cameraman and to michael robert who wa the camera operator and the people around me y'know best boy and everybody it wa quite a collegial enterprise i did n't feel that the whole thing wa on my shoulder at all there were moment of tremendous exhilaration and liberation when i realized how flexible one can be when one is making a film i remember going to look at the set for what we were going to shoot the next day it wa just a boxed set the badminton court and i remember standing there saying 'oh damn i should have had two door one in each corner instead of a central door ' and whoever wa standing there with me said 'well you can have that if you want it ' laugh i 'd come from a world where a set ha to last physically concretely it ha to last for months'some set last for year and the idea of having a set that could be changed hour before it wa used wa completely new i had n't even thought like that not to mention putting a different color of paint of something or whatever it happened to be it wa very fluid and exciting in that way quite unlike any work i 'd ever been involved with in the theater play are n't like novel or movie which once they 're done they 're done play sort of follow you around i know what you mean i can produce a well worn aphorism for you which is that with a movie everything stay the way you left it you did a day 's work and you put it in the fridge and when you came back week later it wa just a you left it i have to flag my aphorism for you that wa the best thing about movie and also the worst because with a play it doe n't stay a you left it which is sometimes frustrating and sometimes very very convenient you can manipulate it while it happening day to day so it cut both way on balance the fact that you felt you 'd got something right like for example there might be a dialogue scene and if you got to a point where you thought to yourself gary and tim really got it right on that take you said 'print ' and it wa there preserved in amber for you i 'm going to see a play of mine day after tomorrow which opened about a month ago and it will be full of thing which will be different and some of it will be slightly out of focus and some of it will be in slightly better focus than before and i guess that 's the reason why i 'm mainly a playwright because i find that an exciting way to work an exciting medium to work in have you ever been tempted to direct another movie no i have n't but only because i 'm lazy there wa the opportunity for me to direct i script i wrote from a late unfinished raymond chandler novel poodle spring i say unfinished but i ca n't remember that may have been a different book but anyway there wa a late chandler book called poodle spring and michael brandman said time and again that i should direct it and because the rest of my life somehow did n't accommodate that'you know going to california for many week or month or however long it took'i basically funked it and when my life settled down again'i forget why it wa volatile at the time'but when it did settle down it became one of the regret in my life which is no disrespect to bob rafelson who did direct it and who of course is far more experienced knowing'a knowing director but it wa a challenge that i shied at i 'm sorry to say but in general i do n't live with a desire to direct a film no a you go through life doe writing get easier harder for me it ha to do with energy so in a rather banal sense it get harder it take me longer to produce a given amount of work and of course there is the sense the general rule with artist turn out to be that from the long perspective of hindsight you liked their early work that is a small joke that pass between writer especially between writer when they are friendly and prove their friendship by insulting each other they tell each other i loved your early work and there are very few great artist who have done major work once they approach or when i think of my favorite writer it wa the way they started off that captured me and left me captive i 'm not an opera person at all but i think of verdi for example a someone who wa writing at the age of work comparable to what he wa doing year earlier i 'd like that to be true of me and in about month i will be so i 'll have to set about trying to prove it i do n't know that i can are you fond of rosencrantz and guildenstern if that 's the word that 's a very good word i think that 's actually a good way to describe one 's positive feeling about one 's own work fondness is very much the word and yes i 'm fond of it one of the great thing about coming back to something certainly in the case of rosencrantz is that you can cut the stuff which you do n't like any more i probably should n't be saying this because from a pr point of view it 's kind of counterproductive but when michael brandman said that he 'd managed to give the movie a kind of relaunch i said 'oh great can i take ten minute out of it ' and he said 'no you ca n't ' and i 'm such a virgin at movie making that it took me a moment to understand why i could n't namely that the music track would be jumping the point but it 's sort of an insight into the creative frame of mind because when we were in postproduction and sort of finessing to a final cut i could not have taken second out of it i would n't have wanted to and a few year later i could 've taken three minute and a few year later six minute one get more brutal about this you become quite severe in your judgment about your own thing movie to me seem sort of hogtied to realism such that if someone in a movie musical break into song it always seems weird whereas when actor sing on stage even though they 're living people standing right in front of you it seems somehow believable or not i wonder if you said the opposite if it would be true for some people that in a movie you just take it on board if somebody burst into song and there 's music behind it and it 's fine in a play one might think that the whole artifice get shattered but it doe n't in either case i 'm not sure i would make the distinction you 're making one of the interesting thing that struck me year ago about comedy on stage'and of course the same is true of comedy on film'is that in a scene where the audience is laughing'and it 's intended that the audience laughs'there is something weird about the fact that nobody on stage is laughing at these very funny thing being said and by the way on one level or another comedy is what i write if it 's not straight out comedy there 's audience laughter in everything i 've written so this is true of my work too but when i 've got a bunch of people in my sitting room and amusing thing are being said what one doe n't do socially is engage in a kind of studied indifference to the comedy to the wit whatever it is one join in one make the noise and so the evening continues but you go and watch the importance of being earnest and the audience is laughing every other line and the character to whom these line are being addressed is completely phlegmatic about them so yeah what one is watching is not a slice of life in any literal sense if you take one of my favorite play ever ever the front page you do n't really want to acknowledge the fact that everything is highly artificial even thought hecht and macarthur were taking real life a their base for everything that happens in the play because life is first draft and theater is final draft theater and movie are both collaborative but are they collaborative in the same way they 're really different in philosophy and principle i know it 's a bit of a truism but i do think that in film the writer doe more often exist to serve the director rather than the other way around i 'm a rather conservative person so this is an old fashioned thing to say but in theater it 's a though everyone exists to serve the writer that becomes le true a one get farther into europe i 'm coming to new york in a couple of day and the first thing i want to see is lazarus which i would say is more director 's theater rosencrantz and guildenstern wa just the first of your play to look at history from the position of the bit player i suppose in my own work that 's the obvious example of finding a story from the perspective of somebody on the margin travesty doe that too doe n't it in a different sense that 's true maybe i could wrench this around until it became true of everything i write laugh i think it 's quite central to me doe that come from a distrust of the main narrative whether it 's play or a history book or whatever it is no i think it 's the opposite one seizes with relief and gratitude the chance to write something which is'well you 're standing on the shoulder of giant sometimes that 's certainly true of rosencrantz but i 've adapted novel by nabokov by doctorow by ballard and i could piously say it 's a privilege but it 's true also that it 's a huge benefit and advantage in that they 've done some of your work for you that 's what i mean i do n't consider myself very good at inventing structure and story and plot i like doing dialogue and the dialogue seems to write itself for me but without the structure the character the story'the narrative let 's say'it 's not a very useful gift dialogue in itself are you working on anything that you can talk about i 'm hoping that in the first part of this year i 'll be writing a screenplay but since it is n't really fixed i suppose i should n't talk about it i usually blab about everything but i 'm trying to learn not to so the answer in a general sense is that the first thing i 'll be writing this year is a screenplay but i very much hope that the second thing will be a play so do i and here if i may i 'll just say thank you for writing arcadia which i think is one of the great piece of theater in my lifetime thank you scott rudin ha been asking me for year and year to do a screenplay and i can vaguely say that it could be happening well i 'm unimaginative enough to say that i ca n't imagine how that would work but ' that 's what i keep telling him rlj entertainment will release the film for the first time on blu ray on

islamic state just a the white house ha nominated a top special operation general to take charge of the isi fight gen joseph votel who now head american special operation force will take over u s central command replacing gen lloyd austin if confirmed by the senate votel previously ran the joint special operation command the elite counterterrorist unit behind the new u s strike force in iraq those jsoc operator are also working with rebel force in syria a part of their widening footprint across the mideast and africa votel 's appointment and the deployment of jsoc to spearhead the isi campaign show that president barack obama is entrusting his national security legacy to the same elite group that killed osama bin laden'an achievement he made sure to mention in his last ever state of the union address the obama administration is counting on the unit 's stepped up operation over the next year to turn around largely negative public opinion of his track record against isi it 's a perception reinforced by jihadist inspired attack in paris san bernardino jakarta and istanbul'not to mention the terror group 's ongoing hold on major city like mosul iraq and raqqa syria a december quinnipiac university poll that found percent of american surveyed thought the u s and it ally are losing the fight against isi in response jsoc 's counterterrorist operation have thickened in place like libya where a sizeable team of operator work in parallel with french and british special force three senior u s official tell the daily beast they focus on tracking and sometimes striking key figure with raid and air strike like the november strike that killed isi leader abu nabil the official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly the official predict the jsoc team in iraq will enable a stepped up campaign against isi in a matter of week working in coordination with the iraqi government and with kurdish force raiding alongside them inside iraq and staging unilateral raid into syria the strike force 's other major role is to feed intelligence from cia nsa and other agency to iraqi and kurdish force to sharpen their anti isi campaign the special operation mission inside syria is at a more embryonic stage a long way from giving new intelligence and targeting information to rebel troop according to a senior u s official who had been briefed this week on the operation 'there are multiple complexity are driving the assessment it 's figuring out who is supporting who and who are we going to be able to work with and who will we not be able to the official said speaking anonymously a a condition of describing the briefing the u s defense secretary ash carter insisted this week that they are already helping 'these force have already established contact with new force that share our goal new line of communication to local motivated and capable partner and new target for airstrikes and strike of all kind carter said in remark wednesday 'they are generating new insight that we turn into new target new strike and new opportunity the syria based special operation team ha already started feeding important information to the white house 'we do think we have begun to identify some place where we can have an impact'in the shaping operation for raqqah isi 's de facto capital an administration official said that can include identifying the route isi us to resupply it weaponry for targeting or even identifying segment of the city that might welcome liberation from an outside force the white house would not comment on special operation outside iraq and syria but confirmed obama 's heavy reliance on the elite unit in the isi fight 'we have chosen special operation a one of the best way to support our local force on the ground'to make sure the victory against isi will be locally earned and locally sustainable the senior administration official said of the isi fight speaking anonymously a a condition of describing the operation 'we are deploying them in a tactical targeted and limited way in small enough number that we deny isi the opportunity to talk about a foreign occupation and use them a a recruiting tool the official added the white house ha also endorsed a special operation takeover of another part of the isi fight by putting former navy seal and current head of special operation at the pentagon michael lumpkin in charge of a revamped state department effort to counter isi propaganda previous iteration of state 's social messaging campaign included engaging in a public twitter war with isi troll considered a mistake by many who practice the dark art known a psychological operation lumpkin is expected to leverage his background and relationship to step up the isi social medium fight by taking it underground 'lumpkin understands that isi want a co dependency with the u s government so to deny them that diminishes their strength said a former senior strategist for special operation speaking anonymously to describe policy debate he predicted lumpkin will build a campaign that includes finding way to enable local voice who are already denouncing isi to speak more loudly while keeping the u s government in the background 'the twitter hashtag in london 'you ai n't no muslim bruv ' got more traction than any of the psa public service announcement that her majesty 's government aired and lumpkin know that the former official said president in need have frequently turned to special operation when faced with intractable problem president john f kennedy supported expanding the u s army 's special force green beret during the cold war with the soviet union their primary mission wa to train local force for proxy fight against communist backed force president jimmy carter turned to special operation force to rescue u s hostage held by iran in an attempt that failed but led to congress 's creation of the u s special operation command the force grew under president george w bush after the attack of september th spearheading the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan and later against the insurgent remnant of saddam 's force and al qaeda in iraq special operation command ha grown to nearly operator today deployed in more than country worldwide with a tempo that ha barely slowed even a the obama administration declares an end to combat operation in iraq and afghanistan on thursday votel wa quick to point out that his special operation force were one element in a larger u s government fight against isi 'special operation force are n't in this by ourselves he said but senior administration official concede that they have been an overused tool in the obama national security toolbox and may need to expand in size to meet the growing demand the frequent refrain from senior special operation commander is that the force is 'frayed beset with high rate of suicide divorce and sign of combat stress like sleep disorder and heavy alcohol use part of the reason they are so popular is the effectiveness of jsoc 's intelligence driven operation working the cia and other agency with what cia chief john brennan ha called scalpel like precision but most of the mission involve training and working with local force at the invitation of foreign government which fit with the obama administration 's goal to stop being the world 's policeman by enabling other force to lead the charge in their region from marine raider to navy seal small team of u s operator are engaged in slow grinding regional campaign like the drug war in latin america or the decade long fight against islamic militant in the philippine 'i think that president obama appreciates the unique capability and approach that sof special operation force offer one senior special operation official said speaking on condition of anonymity to describe senior policy discussion 'he ha been a strong supporter of sof and indeed all of our service the official said there 's been no shortage of grumbling at the pentagon that the white house 's focus on special operation ha created an impression that the u s can get by with a smaller army u s decisionmakers have often preferred deploying special operator because of the ability to keep their mission secret a designed by the law that created them that 's attractive to foreign government that do n't want to reveal to their own people their reliance on foreign force and it 's attractive to u s administration that do n't want to be accused of mission creep or an expansion of combat operation in country where they 've declared war ended the emphasis on more clandestine operation make it more challenge for human right group and aid agency because it 's harder to figure out who to call when they find evidence of civilian casualty or wrongdoing 'a light footprint make it more challenging for u because we do n't have a many counterpart to talk to on the ground said dominik stillhart director of operation for the international committee of the red cross during u s combat operation in iraq and afghanistan there were large force and commander based in country that icrc official could meet face to face 'we provide confidential reporting on condition and treatment of detainee at u s facility the red cross is allowed to visit stillhart said or local villager account in the aftermath of u s special operation raid that help u s military chief police their own'reports he said that special operation command and jsoc have both welcomed in iraq and afghanistan with the expansion of more secretive u s operation worldwide local icrc official in country like libya and somalia find it more challenging to identify who to call fewer u s boot on the ground also mean that there are n't always enough u s force to monitor the behavior of those they trained to make sure they are confirming to international law of war and respect of human rights'a problem that cropped up in afghanistan with afghan local police who went rogue after their special operation trainer had departed the area the secrecy also tie the u s military 's hand when an operation is exposed to the public captured on video thanks to the ubiquitous use of smart phone and propagated on the internet or when special operation mission go sideways a green beret wa killed earlier this month in southern afghanistan leaving behind a three month old son a member of the army 's elite delta force wa slain during a hostage rescue mission in iraq this fall and most disturbingly an american gunship guided by u s

i finally got to a phone she said 'oh i saw that thing i did n't know you were going to do that he mention olympic medalist gu kenworthy who came out last year 'it 's a remarkable thing that at the height of his career he took this risk in a sport in which there is nobody else who is openly gay i think there is still certainly a need for people to be open to the extent that they can be 'i 'm certainly not one to preach to anybody about what they should do with their life but i do think visibility is important he continues 'i understand that people were critical of me for not doing it sooner and i understand the desire to have people who are visible in the public sphere but i think we do what we can cooper considers the empathetic streak that color his work and earned him a label a an 'emo journalist 'i thought it meant emo phillips the first time i heard it he smile 'i find that term interesting because on cable news on a nightly basis you see people angry and yelling and that

particularly extraordinary time in our country i think to not have an emotional response wa virtually impossible 'it 's also interesting because i 'm one of the least emotional people that i know he add 'i press down all my emotion deep down inside i ask if it 's important to him to take politician to task a he 's done publicly with donald trump in the run up to november 's election 'i think it 's just important to be factually correct he emphasizes 'so if someone 's saying something that 's not factually correct whether it 's donald trump or hillary clinton or any candidate i think it 's our job to point that out 'and you can point that out until you 're blue in the face and some people will listen some people wo n't and that 's fine but i think my job is just to try to be a accurate a possible and a fair a possible i do n't argue with people about opinion because everybody ha the right to their opinion but fact matter and it 's important that viewer have fact so they can make up their own mind he describes the contemporary medium landscape a 'the golden age of information but say there 's still considerable work to do to ensure that the voice telling the news reflect the america they 're informing 'there 's not enough diversity but there 's greater diversity than ever before cooper say 'i 'm talking about racial diversity i 'm talking about gender sexuality economic geographic all sort of diversity all of which is important to have in a newsroom and there are more option than ever before that 's all to the good if anything i think there 's too much information that it 's hard to figure out where the information is coming from who 's actually behind it what is their agenda what is their bias if they have a bias but i think diversity is important the more

author and musician based in portland ore from planning a trip to isi held territory in syria later this month to help bring peace to the region through the power of a musical prayer concert 'performing the peace prayer in isi controlled syria will be the most important and dangerous peace mission of my life the self described 'peace troubadour blogged last month 'every peace mission i 've been on ha been dangerous but this journey is without question the most perilous and in my opinion'the most important twyman wrote 'people everywhere are concerned about the escalating violence in the middle east especially with the rise of isi but they do n't feel empowered to be part of the solution that is what we are about to change twyman slinging his cordoba classical guitar is scheduled to fly out jan he 'll first spend a weekend in italy getting ready for the show then will hop a flight to tel aviv to meet a handful of supporter and organizer from there they 'll travel to the israel syria border and set up their musical prayer homebase in majdal sham an israeli occupied druze town in syrian territory twyman traveled to the same town in for a previous peace vigil for syria 'the people there are very anti isi and anti terrorism'it 's where we 'll set up our base of operation he told the daily beast twyman is aware of the kidnapping the high profile beheading the whole war the state department syria travel warning and all that jazz he say that despite his website 's bold phrasing he is taking all necessary precaution for his potential isi land gig 'people have this image of me walking into an isi village with a guitar on my back he said chuckling 'that wo n't be the case the purpose of this is to get ten of thousand if not hundred of thousand of people praying it 's not about me being a super star idiot in syria at this point we 're not sure how far we will go but if people there feel they can get me into an isi area safely and then out safely then we will do just that'the idea is to sing then get back to safety we are hoping for something interesting just not too interesting isi dominated territory in syria is too dangerous even for sylvester stallone so chance of twyman venturing beyond the israeli controlled village are rather slim if twyman 's fellow peace activist ca n't get him into a place where he can perform for some people living under isi rule his fallback plan is to play his set in a safe area 'overlooking an isi controlled area from there he and his team will sing the islamic prayer for peace a the 'peace troubadour strum his acoustic guitar regardless of twyman 's precise location the mission is to rally a many people a possible via the internet to simultaneously 'focus our affirmative prayer on isi in order to'miraculously somehow in unprecedented fashion'stem the bloodshed through divine intervention godspeed he insists that this ha worked before twyman wa inspired to start this brand of musical peace activism in he say after a friend gifted him a piece of paper that included the peace prayer from all major religion 'i just began to hear music and picked up my guitar to play every one he said 'this is what i 'm meant to do i thought he say he later traveled to the balkan during the war and ethnic cleansing in the ' s and got invited by a croatian peace organization to perform in refugee camp he later traveled to belfast during the northern ireland peace negotiation he ha written about some of these experience in his book emissary of light twyman like to tell a story about how he wa invited by saddam hussein to perform at the national theater in baghdad in shortly before the kickoff of operation desert fox 'i wa brought in there to iraq before the u s began the bombing campaign against saddam he recalled 'my first book had just come out and i wa in london on book tour and i wa on a talk show in the u k i mentioned that i 'd love to go to iraq then it turned out somebody in the iraqi embassy in great britain heard that and within a day i received a visa and an official invitation to come to baghdad the daily beast could not independently verify this claim but twyman provided a photo that he say wa taken in front of the theater in iraq following his anti war concert the group had just planted a peace pole that read may peace prevail on earth in four language ultimately the guitar playing peacenik never got the chance to meet the iraqi dictator who had supposedly invited him to play an anti bombing set 'i wa told he watched part of the concert though twyman said next stop syria'maybe if jihadist related condition permit 'when people say i should n't do this because it will make isi mad i say 'if we 're thinking that way then isi ha already won ' he concluded 'there is no way to know what will or will not work but i do n't think there is anything wrong with having a positive attitude or bringing people together particularly those who do believe in the

at that time at least some in the gop had pivoted from a position of outright denial toward one that at least accepted that the world wa warming even if most stopped short of acknowledging that human were to blame a evidence i pointed to a transformation in talking points'from calling global warming a hoax or a fraud to the ubiquitous 'i 'm not a scientist cop out'and a resolution signed by almost every republican senator in january acknowledging the reality of warming some republican including rand paul even signed a separate resolution stating human activity contributed to climate change while i saw this a a positive trend a potential step toward a bipartisan deal to address greenhouse gas emission i cautioned that any progress could be obliterated during primary season after all how would this position survive the pandering to the far right that come with the republican primary during november 's debate we got our answer maria bartiromo of the fox business network pressed paul on the resolution she noted that he wa one of only republican to agree that human played a role in warming wa it possible bartiromo asked to continue america 's booming energy production while simultaneously pursuing a meaningful climate change program paul said that a president he would repeal regulation on energy company yes that 's really how he began he continued 'while i think man ha ' and then stopped 'while i think man may he corrected 'have a role in our climate i know nature doe paul then observed that the earth is billion year old and ha seen hotter and colder period what wa needed now he insisted wa to 'free up the energy sector let 'em drill let 'em explore while none of the candidate denied the earth wa warming none seemed to think it wa much to worry about either joseph romm present a significantly more dire situation in his new book climate change what everyone need to know a physicist and former acting assistant secretary in clinton 's energy department romm run the blog climateprogress org and is the author of several book on energy and climate his new book is essentially a reference guide in which he pose common question '' how do scientist know that recent climate change is primarily caused by human activity 'how doe climate change affect drought 'what will the impact of sea level rise be 'and answer them concisely and conversationally while he is mostly successful avoiding wonkiness he cite such a huge number of study that it 's almost unimaginable that anyone could walk away unconvinced of the matter 's urgency the problem of course is that those who most need to read romm 's book wo n't a i write in fact a video is circulating showing new jersey gov chris christie saying it 's his 'feeling that climate change is not a crisis'irrespective of what scientist think and he 's one of the more progressive republican on the issue the reluctance of the american right to take action against climate change in the face of such overwhelming evidence over so many year will be questioned frequently by historian the data ha n't always been a voluminous a it is now of course but it 's existed for decade romm cite study from a far back a the mid ' s warning of the danger of carbon emission and global warming exxonmobil a we learned recently became aware of the hazard of carbon emission in yet they funded climate denial until just a few year ago charles and david koch of koch industry meanwhile continue to spread misinformation and they have pledged almost billion to influence the presidential contest when i interviewed romm in he asserted that the key figure pushing climate denial will be judged very harshly by history 'in the category of neville chamberlain or people who were shill for the tobacco industry the basic fact of climate change a romm make clear are not particularly complicated since the beginning of the th century the earth ha warmed about f c most of that warming ha come since this warming trend track almost perfectly the increase in human generated greenhouse gas emission mostly carbon but also methane and others over the same period there is now more carbon in the earth 's atmosphere part per million than there ha been in more than one million year while it 's certainly true that the earth 's climate ha changed over the age the reasons'solar variability volcano etc 'have been analyzed and discarded a the 'forcings driving current trend in fact romm concludes 'in the absence of human activity ' the planet would likely have cooled in recent decade in other word the forcing that is changing our climate now is u most scientist agree that a warming of c f over pre industrial level would be near catastrophic for human and we are on course to exceed that by century 's end scientist are seeking to keep the temperature rise below c f which would avoid many of the worst impact but that would mean taking significant action to reduce emission already percent of our glacier are shrinking the sea are rising and acidifying they are acidifying faster than they have in million year storm are getting worse drought are lasting longer california 's drought is the worst in year and forest fire are more frequent the wildfire season is two month longer than it used to be romm even present new evidence suggesting that high level of carbon in the air reduce cognitive ability given the pressing need for action climate change is the right book at the right time accessible comprehensive unflinching humane this is all pretty alarming though not 'alarmist but the good news is that popular support for action is high in a recent poll two third of american favored the deal made at the cop conference in which nearly nation agreed to limit emission so that the global temperature rise stay 'well below c f moreover the chinese have agreed to an emission cap for the first time ever helping nudge global leader along were the three quarter of a billion people around the world who marched in support of an agreement significant obstacle remain some right here at home along with republican presidential candidate congressional republican do n't exactly seem moved to action on december in fact the republican led house voted to block emission rule on power plant explaining why rep jeff duncan of south carolina blasted president obama for taking the 'pseudoscientific threat of climate change more seriously than radical jihadist what rep duncan may not realize is that strong evidence exists to support a link between climate change and terrorism

will in all likelihood not run against hillary clinton the conventional wisdom is probably right in this case it 's hard to imagine that against clinton bloomberg would be anything but a naderesque spoiler which he would know and not want to be against bernie sander on one side and crump on the other either ted cruz or donald trump however i think bloomberg becomes a candidate'and a real player unfortunately for bloomberg the chance of sander winning the democratic nomination are quite slim a he surely know so the rubber hitting road question is is there any chance he 'd run against clinton i mean if nothing else this is presumably his last shot at glory a he 's a few week shy of what 's with all these septuagenarian anyway there wa a hint in that time article that suggested he might consider doing that'that at a dinner party at the home of a prominent clinton backer last fall bloomberg offered a 'piquant assessment those time euphemism of clinton 's weakness built around 'questions about her honesty and the email mess i can back this up on saturday i spoke with a longtime new yorker i know who heard bloomberg inveigh similarly last year at another such event a bloomberg delivered a blistering critique of the email controversy and even suggested'well piquantly 'that clinton deserved to be in very serious legal trouble this person wa 'shocked by how little he seemed to think of her a source in bloomberg world say this is nonsense this person claim to have heard the ex mayor limn clinton in adulatory tone numerous time saying in this person 's word that she wa practically alone among the candidate in being able 'to take care of business 'simply to run the government and country responsibly and prudently from the technocratic bloomberg praise doe n't come higher both these thing can be true of course let 's assume that bloomberg wa aghast at the email situation last year but that it 's faded and he 's now decided he 'd be fine with a clinton presidency even a he explores a bid of his own okay but even this brings u to another thought'that maybe bloomberg think there 's some chance clinton might be indicted sometime soon if you were shocked to read that sentence you 're clearly not reading enough conservative web site let me say up front here that while i have no idea of the status of the ongoing fbi investigation into the email business i would be really surprised to see this happen righties have been predicting her imminent indictment ever since bill safire 's ignominious column but a far a is known publicly clinton is not under investigation it wa last summer when the fbi started looking into the matter and official announced then that clinton wa n't a target but that wa month ago so who know really this charles mccullough the intelligence community inspector general who keep retroactively stamping 'classified on email clinton read or wrote when she wa secretary and who originally notified the executive branch last july that classified information might exist on clinton 's server sure seems to be an aggressive sort i think it 's a farfetched scenario myself an ex prosecutor friend tell me that a crime would require criminal intent then there 's the question of the timing somebody 's going to bring serious charge against one of the two major party ' leading presidential hopeful in an election year conservative whose carotid vein are popping after reading that sentence would do well to remember a time when they excoriated a prosecutor who brought suspiciously timed indictment of republican google lawrence walsh but mostly it seems farfetched to me because i just consider it pretty unlikely that any secretary of state any american in that position would knowingly compromise u s intelligence gathering effort if you talk to plugged in liberal they say forget it ridiculous if you talk to plugged in conservative they well they at least hope it 's going to happen think it clearly ought to happen and maybe this week i e before democrat start casting vote if nothing else a non indictment give them all a chance to caterwaul for another few month or year about how the clinton keep getting away with thing and go raise money off that and what if these conservative happen to be right well when i 've discussed this with liberal most people think joe biden is the automatic plan b john kerry get a few mention on the ground that he tried it once before but that strike me a a minus not a plus in any case democrat i 've discussed this with all assume they rally behind a new establishment type candidate rather than throwing in their egg with bernie or maybe they could rally to a bloomberg bid since many many democrat represent district where a sander endorsement could hurt them and do n't forget the above scenario seems to assume that clinton under such circumstance would just stop in her track not sure we can assume that i hope and believe all this will remain hypothetical i just bet it 's rattling around in bloomberg 's cage somewhere,60026.0

congress for year with the most conservative wing battling party leader on issue from spending to immigration a propublica analysis of campaign donation highlight just how profound this gap ha become in the house of representative the analysis show that the republican leadership including speaker paul ryan and majority leader kevin mccarthy raise money from a vastly different set of political action committee than member further to the right in fact the donor base for ryan and mccarthy are actually more similar to some democrat than to their colleague in the main conservative grouping the freedom caucus the fundraising disparity stokes the divisive atmosphere in congress reinforcing policy difference and sometimes affecting the outcome of legislation in surprising way for example when a republican backed plan to ease a campaign finance rule evaporated in congress it wa the most conservative gop lawmaker in the house who joined with liberal democrat to get it killed the provision which died in december wa initiated by senate majority leader mitch mcconnell of kentucky and wa included in a must pas spending bill it would have eliminated cap on the money a national party committee can spend in coordination with a candidate the cap were originally meant to reduce the amount of outside cash flowing directly to advocacy for a particular candidate those in favor of lifting the restriction say they are outmoded in the increasingly wild world of campaign finance and effectively give le accountable outside group like super pac more influence than traditional party many democrat argued that eliminating the cap would have opened the spigot to even more big money in politics for conservative the reason to oppose the mcconnell plan wa different it might have helped republican leader quash internal dissenter with a bigger campaign war chest raised from donor who support mainstream republican the party would find it easier to select and back it favored house candidate 'the mcconnell rider provides preferential treatment to the washington establishment the conservative action project a group led by former attorney general edwin meese wrote in appealing to like minded lawmaker to fight the measure the difference in donor base affect other policy debate said dave brat of virginia a freedom caucus member who defeated then majority leader eric cantor in the primary and went on to take his seat for instance he said conservative lost their fight to defund the u s export import bank last year in part because the company that benefit from the bank won over republican and democrat who received campaign contribution from those firm the disparity is 'a huge deal brat said propublica 's analysis used a calculation called cosine similarity to compare each house member ' donor to others two member with an identical set of donor would receive a score of while two with no pac donor in common would get a score of the degree of similarity between ryan 's pac donor and those of freedom caucus member justin amash of michigan and ted yoho of florida wa close to nil and tim huelskamp a kansa republican who lost his seat on the house agriculture committee in for his vote against leadership had few pac donor in common with ryan a score of or any other house colleague in his highest score wa with fellow kansan mike pompeo pac donor to house majority leader mccarthy of california were more like democratic whip steny hoyer 's score than they were those of ohio republican jim jordan who head the freedom caucus the gap between the leadership and insurgent ha widened since that year mccarthy 's pac donor were more similar to those of michele bachmann the former minnesota congresswoman who founded the house 's tea party caucus than they were to pac that gave to then majority leader cantor or then speaker john boehner by the end of the gulf between mccarthy and the conservative wa much wider all house gop leader and even house democrat had pac donor more similar to mccarthy 's than any member of the freedom caucus the donor that typically back house leader are large corporate pac with broad interest before congress they include the automotive free trade international pac which represents american dealer of foreign car manufacturer the pac give hundred of thousand of dollar to republican candidate of which just went to three dozen freedom caucus member during the cycle on the other hand none of the leader received contribution from the citizen united political victory fund which is one of the top overall donor to freedom caucus member the two faction do have some pac donor in common such a the koch industry pac which gave to member of the house freedom caucus identified by the pew research center during the last election the kochpac gave more than million to republican house candidate including it leader but even in case where the same pac back both camp the amount are often lopsided with le money going to freedom caucus member many of who are relatively junior lawmaker the home depot pac for example gave the maximum to score of lawmaker ' campaign in only one of them barry loudermilk of georgia where home depot ha it headquarters is a freedom caucus member other member of the freedom caucus received donation from the pac but not for the maximum amount stephen holmes a spokesman for home depot said many factor go into the company 's pac giving but caucus membership wa n't one of them the failure of mcconnell 's plan to lift the cap on party spending show how the source of lawmaker ' contribution influence their vote republican generally have voted in favor of looser rule on raising and spending campaign money especially since the passage of the mccain feingold law that banned national party from collecting unlimited contribution rick hasen a university of california irvine law professor who study campaign finance and election said it 's notable that the freedom caucus pushed to preserve the party restriction 'sometimes hasen said 'self interest can trump ideology,5081.0

if i 'm visiting relative in taiwan over the holiday and feel like mainlining comfort food tv rather than making the effort to interact with my family i can surf directly to netflix and cue up orange is the new black without going through the rigmarole of a vpn cue master of none joke about watching dexter in india netflix is n't doing it for me though'they 've already got my subscription fee they 're doing it for my cousin in taiwan who theoretically could be netflix subscriber already if they wanted to but would have to go through the rigmarole of using a service like a vpn or dns proxy to trick netflix into thinking they 're in the united state before they could use it it set up an interesting situation because in theory netflix is n't actually giving people anything they did n't already have a way to get vpns and dns proxy service are numerous and do n't require much technical skill to use they 're arguably technically illegal'new zealand isps are currently embroiled in a legal battle over how illegal they are'but that doe n't stop anyone from using them medium superfans abroad who really desperately want to see making a murderer or jessica jones have already seen it indeed all netflix is doing is lifting a restriction that they instituted in the first place from a technical perspective streaming jessica jones over the web to auckland new zealand is n't any more difficult than streaming it to los angeles california that 's the whole point of the world wide web and of the internet a a whole to be a decentralized network where any node in the system can access any other netflix ha to take extra steps'steps that cost money and resources'to determine based on your ip address what part of the world your computer is in and block you from downloading their content if you 're in the wrong place this is still the case even after they 've 'gone global 'israelis still ca n't watch orange is the new black singaporean ca n't watch house of card and only canadian get early access to a streaming version of star war the force awakens ironically for people who were already tech savvy enough to watch netflix overseas netflix going global will actually make it harder for israeli to watch orange is the new black netflix preceded their new year 's announcement of going global by over christmas weekend quietly taking step to make vpns harder to use on their service presumably to increase the incentive for people to sign up for legitimate overseas netflix account in other word content that wa in all practical term readily available for anyone who knew how to get it will now actually be harder for some people to get enter the tangled legal debate over geoblocking geoblocking is just another one of the many perverse situation created by an analogue marketplace that ha yet to catch up to a digital world it 's similar to the concept of medium piracy the way we buy book movie music and the like used to depend on the idea of medium coming in physical forms'bundles of page magnetic tape vinyl discs'that were costly to replicate but give everyone computer that a a matter of course make perfect copy of any information they process all the time a part of the inherent nature of processing it and the system fall apart you 're reduced to asking people to pretend that the mp on their computer which their computer can make thousand of copy of in second work like a physical vinyl record'or else your whole economy for compensating artist stop working it 's a situation that simply feel intrinsically perverse and ca n't be enforced without the creepy situation of giving the corporation that sell you music control over the computer you own it lead to endless ideological battle over what 'owning information even mean in the first place and what the moral obligation to pay for your entertainment really is geoblocking take it a level beyond that back when movie and tv show came in canister of film that had to be shipped from place to place the distribution network for movie and tv were built up separately country by country the right to sell movie and tv show were likewise split up in contractual agreement region by region country by country and parceling out those 'foreign right remains a high stake endeavor for people negotiating contract even in the world of book publishing'which ha far fewer moving part than releasing a feature film'the idea of collapsing foreign distribution right into one set of 'global right would be a seismic shock to how business is done so from the business side of thing the creation of this magical global communication network where someone in australia can browse the exact same world wide web a someone in hungary is a problem'and creating artificially separated 'distribution network between the two country make perfect sense even though in reality there 's only one distribution network now the internet from the customer 's side of thing it 's worse than anti piracy provision at least anti piracy provision are about getting you to pay money for something you want to watch geoblocking is about preventing you from using the computer you own and the internet connection you pay for to access a streaming service you also pay for and watch a movie or tv show with all it embedded advertising intact just because you 're living in the wrong country at the time the earlier generation of geoblocking region locking on internationally distributed dvd sparked a similar customer revolt and an underground trade in region free dvd player and 'region dvd that wa n't so much resolved a mooted once dvd were eclipsed by streaming service it 's an interesting situation a long a traditional distribution continues to exist alongside internet distribution distributor have a legitimate incentive to control the latter'dvd region locking started because distributor did n't want the dvd of a hollywood movie to be available in europe when that movie wa still just opening up in european cinema similarly the right to distribute orange is the new black in israel are theoretically worth something if they become worthless because everyone in israel is streaming orange is the new black through a vpn anyway then the creator have theoretically lost money how much money they 've really lost is up for debate just like the debate over how much revenue artist really lose due to piracy and yet it still seems at the end of the day ridiculous to keep people in a country who have money and want to buy something from buying it just because the right middleman are n't in place american customer are n't going to stand for being told they have to pay to watch the olympics in canada because of behind the scene wheeling and dealing not when changing your ip address to a canadian one take five minute ' worth of work after all that wa the same commercial logic behind killing aereo and telling people it 's illegal to hook up a tv tuner to a computer so people can watch over the air programming online those streaming right could theoretically be sold later for a lot of money and from a creator 's perspective aereo wa taking that money out of their pocket for a customer'like me'who see this ruling a basically a requirement that i buy an extra set of equipment a pair of rabbit ear and a tv tuner to watch jeopardy on my computer at instead of just doing so online it 's infuriating netflix hope to cut the gordian knot by creating it own content and pushing it out through it own service with no middleman at all making show that are distributed on a 'global right basis from beginning to end i wish them good luck especially because just a with getting people to pay for content a opposed to pirating it getting people to watch netflix 'legitimately rather than through a vpn is mostly a matter of good will i have my doubt though especially since one of the first reaction to netflix going global wa american scrambling to get a vpn service so they can get illicit international goody like that early access streaming of the force awakens a with other digital service maybe most of them online streaming exists in a weird limbo where playing by the rule is mostly voluntary netflix is still after all banned completely in china a country with the harshest and scariest restriction on online content around and yet tech savvy chinese citizen watch netflix'and browse facebook and twitter'all the time despite the government 's best attempt at playing whack a mole with vpn service it 's not that hard either if you want to torrent show that are too annoying to stream or to read your favorite website without giving any money to their advertiser nowadays content is mostly funded by laziness plus a dollop of guilt people who find paying the relatively cheap monthly fee for a streaming service easy enough that they give in to doing thing the legitimate way despite the miniscule chance of getting in actual legal trouble china bother to keep the great firewall up because of the majority of people who do n't care enough to circumvent it netflix is hoping that they 'll get a major influx of regular user worldwide who previously lacked the interest to jump through the hoop necessary to circumvent geoblocking and that that massive influx will give them enough funding to eventually develop a fully internet based distribution model that cut out those pesky regional distributor once and for all what they probably fear is the reverse that this will just give tech savvy existing netflix user worldwide more international content to sift through using the geoblocking circumvention tool they 've been using all along pissing off the regional distributor netflix still ha to work with with little net gain to them in the end a someone who already doe watch content intended for other region regularly i 'm going to be inconvenienced by netflix 's crackdown on vpns more than anything else but i 'll take that inconvenience if it brings u closer to the day we can leave all this nonsense behind u and have truly border free medium,663.0

other mormon jew and every other ethnicity under the sun fortunately for me i 'm a comedian it 's my job to make fun of people and it 's an absolute pleasure but most people in america ca n't get away with publicly making fun of people 's ethnicity because it 's 'politically incorrect but what doe 'political correctness really accomplish in america recently i filmed a documentary series for netflix exploring four different subject matter racism marriage silicon valley and drug for the episode on racism i had a roundtable discussion with representative from the medium action network for asian american the anti defamation league the naacp the national hispanic medium coalition american indian in film television the council on american islamic relation we were there to discus the way i and some others in the entertainment industry often talk about'and make stereotypical fun of'asians jew black american indian and muslim not necessarily in that order and by no mean is that list all inclusive we had an honest discussion about whether or not it 's funny appropriate helpful or hurtful to traffic in ethnic racial and religious stereotype i know stereotype and politically incorrect language are hurtful to some people but a we talked one on one the representative of these organizations'each of them outstanding organization doing valuable work to highlight the ethnic racial and religious sensitivity of american concerning the way we talk to and about each other'all ended up smiling and laughing about example of politically incorrect humor because they could see i wa sincerely joking there 's a vast difference between white officer chasing down and killing unarmed black men versus making a joke about black people being late and while we 're at it naacp stand for the national association for the advancement of colored people no one think this acronym need an update now i do n't mean to shortchange the real damage that political incorrectness cause black comedian are famous for using the n word in their comedy without anyone raising an objection but i would n't dare use that word myself since i still feel lousy about north america 's year award winning record of mistreating black people but if the black community think the n word is funny well then more black power to them and mazel tov to everybody'and yet even though the classical definition of comedy is tragedy plus time it remains unfunny when a white person us the n word in the same vein america 's capital city of washington d c ha little business calling it football team the 'redskins after european american did their smallpox and imperial best to obliterate the native american population the german do n't have a bundesliga soccer team called the berlin jew for a reason if native american want to go ahead and joke about their skin color i have no reservation obviously we do n't want a nation full of nasty racist and heartfelt misanthrope trumpeting their spite on proud public display but we do want people to be able to honestly express themselves and know the difference between humor and malice this is america after all and the first amendment deserves to come first s ren kierkegaard that dour s danish delight made a really good point when he wrote 'people demand freedom of speech a a compensation for the freedom of thought which they seldom use and that 's the nut'or testicle'of the problem we want people to speak their minds'if only they 'd use their mind for just a split second before they spoke instead of blurting out the first stupid thing that bubble up another european smarty pant arthur schopenhauer that great german philosopher from the same era wa n't kidding around when he wrote 'a sense of humor is the only divine quality of man without a sense of humor communication and conversation among men woman hermaphrodite and transgendered alike would all be hopeless and if you 've ever met someone'especially a hermaphrodite'without a sense of humor you know damn well that the situation is hopeless so what 's needed is not political correctness but rather more appreciation of american history more self confidence in each of our individual american soul some joy in our heart and a collective sense of humor if we 're all going to get along and talk about what weird tribal ethnic religious racial dna perfume and skin tone each of u is wearing american have given political correctness a try and it 's not working we 're better off just saying what 's on our mind'and thinking about it before we say it'and laughing about it after we say it just a there 's nothing funny about death cancer abortion suicide poverty and a broken heart that certainly doe n't mean we should n't joke about each and every one of those tragedy likewise a good laugh over america 's failed experiment in political correctness is the order of the day please i 'm begging you america make fun of this jew mormon girl whose grandfather wa a soldier in hitler 's german army i have a sense of humor'and i prefer to sit indian style while using it,40744.0

of several multi million dollar super pac supporting sen ted cruz 's presidential bid ha never run a campaign never run a super pac and never run for office but the self taught historian and evangelical tea party favorite may be the perfect man in to court and care for deep pocketed evangelical gop donor in a year when cruz and the super pac supporting him will rely on evangelicals for every vote'and every dollar'they can get while barton may be new to super pac he is not at all new to politics the former christian school principal and ordained minister wa also the vice chairman of the texas gop for nearly year in he worked for the rnc to turn evangelicals in texas out to for george w bush in he wa a member of the rnc 's platform committee that called for a constitutional ban on abortion and defined marriage a a union between one man and one woman and since then he 's been courted and praised by newt gingrich mike huckabee michele bachmann and nearly every other conservative presidential candidate looking to capture crucial evangelical voter 'having david barton running the super pac give it a lot of validity for evangelicals and pastor said mike gonzalez the south carolina evangelical chair for the cruz for president campaign 'a lot of time super pac are viewed a kind of the bulldog in the campaign they get nasty they get dirty but gonzalez said having barton at the helm give the pac instant integrity with evangelicals in particular 'that 's what i would say is the main reason they went with barton he 's not going to be attacking a person 's family or attacking them personally he 's going to make sure it 's on policy barton 's keep the promise pac is one of four almost identically named super pac supporting cruz the pac can and do coordinate with each other but not with cruz or his campaign barton 's pac ha raised more than million from a small group of large donor including the houston texan ' ceo bob mcnair veteran gop strategist kellyanne conway manages keep the promise i funded by a single million contribution from new york hedge funder robert mercer similarly ktp ii is the home for a million donation from toby neugebauer while ktp iii is funded by million from the wilks brother the retired fracking billionaire from cisco tex who are also devotee of the right leaning assembly of yahweh th day church barton 's own politics are conservative and a he describes them 'bible centered he is staunchly anti abortion anti gay marriage pro second amendment and pro free market he ha spoken extensively about his belief that that jesus wa against capital gain tax the estate tax and the minimum wage he ha called president obama 'the most biblically hostile president in u s history and call on christian to vote for and elect 'righteous leader barton 's involvement in politics in the past and now is a logical extension of wallbuilders the aledo tex company he founded whose mission is to encourage government official to develop policy that 'reflect biblical value wallbuilders also call on christian to involve themselves government and politics and creates dvd and book that feature some of the thousand of original document from the country 's founding that barton ha acquired which he point to a proof that the united state wa founded explicitly a a christian nation a much a barton 's writing have drawn fan among the religious right his work ha received equally extensive criticism from scholar and historian that call his work deeply flawed and cheery picked history 'david barton ha repeatedly said that portion of the constitution are taken verbatim from the bible which is ludicrous and easily disproved said peter montgomery a senior fellow with people for the american way the progressive interest group that ha devoted significant resource to following barton and debunking his work 'he say that constitution and the declaration of independence came out of preacher ' sermon so that we should look at them a christian document even though the constitution explicitly is not that and wa chosen to not be that but not all of the criticism of barton 's work come from the left his book the jefferson lie exposing the myth you 've always believed about thomas jefferson wa pulled from bookshelf by it christian publisher over multiple inaccuracy an episode dismissed a a smear campaign from 'liberal bastard by barton supporter including glenn beck who offered to re publish the book himself the controversy appears to have done nothing to diminish barton in the eye of his supporter 'you have to consider the source mike gonzalez said 'who are you going to believe the person who owns original document or a professor who ha none of those and is just basically going off of revised history david barton is a walking history book he is a man of integrity that kind of personal loyalty to a leader among evangelicals is invaluable for any campaign but is of particular importance to cruz who ha made it clear that he is not looking to expand his appeal beyond the base of the republican party to new voter particularly if they 're evangelicals to make sure that happens barton 's ktp pac hosted a gathering of high profile pastor in cisco tex last month to introduce faith leader to cruz conway 's ktp i ha hired field staff in south carolina ten in iowa and staffer in missouri oklahoma kansa in state in several the sec primary state she ha also plowed cash into phone banking door knocking digital and social outreach in early state and recently made a million ad buy in the four early state 'my philosophy is that our resource are ample but not unlimited she said while conway 's and barton 's super pac have been visibly active ktp ii and ktp iii the naugebauer and wilks ' super pac have kept nearly every penny of their original million haul dormant like two loaded gun just waiting to fire this situation ha caused heartburn for cruz staffer and associate who have no say'and no idea'about when how or even if the money will be spent conway said that the four super pac are 'affiliated so that we wo n't duplicate effort they coordinate strategy and messaging but ultimately the decision making process for each pac lie within the pac itself the path the super pac settle on could make the difference for cruz whose momentum ha stalled in the poll but is a clear second to donald trump in iowa and south carolina and across the rest of the south which will vote a a block in the 'sec primary on march if anyone at the super pac is worried they 're not saying so 'we are seeing growing support nationwide for sen cruz throughout the evangelical community and we are confident they will turn out to support him barton told the daily beast for barton the man once dubbed 'the most

fuzzy although the testis produce testosterone transgender woman undergoing hrt are prescribed spironolactone a diuretic that also block androgen receptor reducing testosterone level to a normal

another 'holocaust cartoon contest in which the cartoonist who most viciously mock the nazi genocide will be awarded it may be tempting to dismiss such iranian mischief a harmless foolishness but tehran 's hateful contest reminds u that political cartoon increasingly are recognized a powerful instrument of influence a cartoon in the new york world played a crucial role in the outcome of the u s presidential race the democrat plastered walt mcdougall 's send up of republican candidate james blaine on thousand of billboard across the state helping to deliver hotly contested new york to democrat grover cleveland he won the state by just vote in the early s politician in several state were so stung by cartoonist ' barb that they introduced legislation to limit what cartoonist were allowed to draw in pennsylvania for example the governor initiated a bill to stop cartoonist from portraying elected official a bird or other animal in the s the hitler regime used cartoon to incite hatred of germany 's jew the leading nazi propaganda organ the weekly newspaper der sturmer wa filled with vicious caricature of jew a vampire insect and especially a sexual defiler of german woman a typical cartoon would feature a huge leering spider with a jewish face attempting to ensnare an innocent german maiden or a swarthy jewish doctor hovering over a sedated half dressed female german patient israel 's foreign ministry recently released a brief youtube video comparing the anti jewish stereotype in some contemporary palestinian cartoon to the image used by hitler while one should always be cautious about making comparison to the nazi it certainly wa disturbing to see a recent cartoon on a palestinian authority website showing a leering hook nosed israeli soldier beginning to disrobe while pinning down a weeping muslim woman wearing a headdress representing jerusalem 's most famous mosque the caption read 'al aqsa is being raped israeli official contend that the recent wave of palestinian stabbings and car ramming attack ha been inspired in part by palestinian political cartoon portraying such violence a heroic and encouraging young palestinian to use knife and automobile a weapon the best known example of the link between cartoon and violence are not the cartoon urging reader to take up arm but rather the cartoon that were met by violent muslim protest these include the riot following the publication by the danish newspaper jylland posten of cartoon depicting muhammad the massacre of the staff of the french weekly charlie hebdo which had published muhammad cartoon and last year 's terrorist attack on a texas event that wa showcasing caricature of muhammad such violence ha had a chilling effect in some quarter the editor at yale university press in removed all the muhammad cartoon image from a book they published about the cartoon controversy several prominent cartoonist including garry trudeau 'doonesbury have asserted that charlie hebdo 's cartoon about muhammad were the equivalent of 'hate speech but even if that characterization were accurate the fact is that in america hate speech is legal the possibility that someone 's word may offend is no reason to muzzle the speaker the right to offend is part of the right to free speech and frankly offending people is practically the raison d ' tre of political cartoonist that doe not mean that every political cartoon deserves the housekeeping seal of approval it mean that it is up to editor to decide if a cartoon is so tasteless that it should not be published and it is up to reader to decide if they dislike a particular cartoonist so much that they do not want to purchase that newspaper of course there are different reason people may take offense at a cartoon many people were troubled recently when a cartoon in the washington post depicted the young child of u s senator ted cruz a trained monkey there is a general consensus in the political world that candidate ' child should be off limit the post apologized and pulled the cartoon but sometimes cartoon that at first glance appear to be tasteless may not actually be charlie hebdo last week published a cartoon that many interpreted a suggesting that the drowned syrian refugee boy had he lived would have grown up to sexually harass woman some pundit however understood that cartoon to be mocking opponent of muslim refugee immigration'similar in spirit to the famous new yorker cover depicting barack obama a a muslim and michelle obama a an armed revolutionary that cartoon wa intended a a comment on how some of the obamas ' opponent perceived them the vigorous reaction and debate over such cartoon is precisely what one would expect in a free society in iran by contrast the only kind of political cartoon that can be published without the cartoonist being imprisoned are those which the regime approves'for example cartoon denying the holocaust or comparing israel to nazi germany here in america we ensure cartoonist ' freedom to skewer hypocritical politician or antagonize interest group by guaranteeing their right to irritate or offend and if they cross the line into the realm of tastelessness then the natural force of reason and taste usually serve a a counter this informal system of check and balance ha served cartoonist editor and the public well since our country 's earliest day no doubt totalitarian regime will continue to use cartoon to advance their aim because they know that cartoon are powerful instrument of persuasion but for that same reason free society must continue protecting the right of cartoonist to compete unrestrained in the marketplace of idea,11600.0

and shouting 'lalala a someone try to impart vital information to you have you in short defied every intruding tentacle of modern medium to ensure you can watch the final season of downton abbey in american time rather than british if so congratulation and i assume you have the cucumber sandwich pot of tea and dense fruitcake in hand for sunday night 's premiere thedaily beast 's review will run after each episode downton abbey finally finished it life in the uk on christmas day and it did so with a flood of article and review none of which will be linked to here because lalala one headline gave something huge away to this reader whose eye alighted upon the headline before realizing what the headline wa in that split second there wa both horror and a determined self imposed amnesia on what had been seen five day later i am again none the wiser i know nothing i must know nothing do not tell me anything lalala so what do we want for this merry band of poshos their servant and that honey colored house of intrigue we left them at the end of season five in various state of romantic and personal chaos i think it 's not too much of a leap to suggest there is a consensus that mr hughes and mr carson should indeed proceed happily to the altar however this is downton abbey and a mr hughes for some reason had a huge where the hell did that come from speech at the end of season five about having to take care of psychotic relative perhaps their journey to marital bliss will not come without a bug eyed sister appearing out of a shadow with a rolling pin unless series creator and writer julian fellowes ha had another idea for them bet must also be placed on who out of mr or mr bates will spend the duration of season six wrongly accused of murder and in jail currently it 's mr bates facing the slammer but this is only until mr bates find someone evil associated with the case and doe n't kill them but look like he doe and then he is wrongly accused of it and then end up ' unless unless unless julian fellowes can think of something new to put mr and mr bates through which doe n't involve a wrongful murder accusation i know radical suggestion just saying similarly edith the ugly duckling child ha basically been fellowes ' punching bag since the story 's start first it wa her plainness and dourness that wa bitchily targeted by her glamorous man magnet older si then fellowes put edith through a succession of hurtful humiliating romantic disaster then she gave birth to a baby that shame dictated she give away but have near then that baby wa introduced to her home a an orphan which she would take care of in season six edith and mary will surely both be shown pursuing career oriented paths'both very different and both probably derailed by romantic intrigue how long can edith or poor edith a her many fan know and love her go through this cycle of relentless degradation and having emotional excrement thrown at her we may want edith to have a happy ending'i want it more powerfully than i want mary to have one or cora to have a full blooded storyline of her own'but you sense fellowes is going to put her through yet more ludicrous wringer to get there a for lady mary she had a bottleneck of posh suitor by the end of last season handsome chap with chiseled jaw but all truly dreary and dull the problem with mary is that she can never outdo her initial love story with matthew and the death of mr pamuk but more men come for her armed with defrosting gun in season six i want to know nothing else lalala it seems kind of ridiculous that they do n't put her together with branson her dead sister 's surviving husband it is ruining nothing to reveal he is coming back for season six a good ending must surely be in line for barrow whom we last saw scheming for good against lord sinderby in season five the formerly total evil closeted gay footman ha been softened of late'and after a dispiriting flirtation with reparative therapy may be set to hold his nascent rainbow flag a little more proudly lord grantham and cora can only be rocked by something totally unpredictable'even regular viewer have tired of how many time downton itself can be in peril'although season six will surely open up a new avenue of this perennial favorite ever since she slipped on the soap and lost her baby cora ha been storyline free'apart from batting her doe eye in a perfect hostess way'until last season 's set of brief and ultimately chaste assignation with that art critic played by richard e grant a for baxter and molesley get them together extend their hart to hart style detective work into a fully fledged agency this leaf posh cuz rose whom i do n't yet really care about nice a she is mr patmore under siege from more kitchen technology the countess dowager the fierce incomparable dame maggie smith last seen dispatching a lovelorn russian aristo back into the arm of his estranged wife and kitchen maid daisy who want something better but keep coming back to scraping potato the barest of thing we do know or may care to know going into season six it is the estate'yes'is going through yet more change a in a mirror to modern recessionary times'the high cost of running downton mean servant may be in the firing line text from friend in london'shut up lalala'suggest that happy ending are in order but the soft driving wind around downton have always been about 'change ' and it imminence and it inevitability even when episode are bad and storyline drift incomprehensibly for month at a time'as with the bates 's and their wrongful imprisonments'there is still the charm of a soup competition or the parrying banter between the countess dowager and isobel crawley'a favorite of this viewer played beautifully by penelope wilton the perfection is in the mix and even when that mix is not perfect there is something in the way fellowes craft downton that keep fan satiated the final season of any show however is the hardest'saying goodbye giving the character the ending that both they deserve and the viewer deserve for that fellowes 's autocratic stewardship of the show augur well'if anyone know this eclectic maddening loveable group of server and the served and the both tender and tense yoking that bind them it is fellowes whatever else'no spoiler this'he will do right by them,20929.0

in the tank folded a basket of laundry and tidied up the tiny motel room we lived in and then i went to my car and pulled the small caliber revolver from the locked glove compartment i sat in the dimly lit room'for minute or hour i do not know'surrounded by the remains of my life haunted by a broken marriage that wa nearly ten year gone a failed business a pile of overdue utility bill and a string of eviction notice we were living if you could call it that on a week in child support and a few hundred dollar each month in food stamp what wa left of our furniture wa in storage paid for by our church benevolent fund there had been two flat tire but no job interview that week the weekly motel rent wa due again and not a dime left on my credit card to cover it i placed my gun on the bed and kneeled down on the carpet to pray i listed my complaint and my failing 'father help me i remember feeling tired when i turned on my old desktop computer logged into aol and started to type out what i intended to be a final message to family and a few close friend 'i want to thank you i started i sat there a while longer realizing there wa nothing i really wanted to say until an instant message popped up on the screen 'hi mom how are you 'hey katie lady ' 'i 'm in the computer lab and guess what 'what is it sweetie 'i won the election 'that 's great honey 'i 'll see you after school 'see you then ' tonight a the country continues a national conversation on gun control i am thinking about my old gun i purchased it and two others over the year they were handgun bought legally a a mean of personal protection each year there are some victim of gun violence in the u s nearly half of those death come at the hand of another whether it is the bushmaster that cut down a classroom of schoolchildren an assault style weapon used to carry out a massacre in a church basement or a movie theater or one of the thousand of cheap illegal handgun that flood our street gun violence continues to capture national headline when we talk about gun control invariably we are talking about those gun we do n't talk about the gun in the nightstand we do n't talk about the one in the lockbox in the top of a bedroom closet we do n't talk about the one like mine secured in the glove compartment of a car and even when we do discus mental health a a factor we rarely'if ever'mention the nearly american who commit suicide each year when we talk about expanding access to mental healthcare we mean for the mass shooter who wipe out an entire kindergarten class we mean for the loner who walk into a movie theater and shoot indiscriminately into the darkness we mean for the man who target a planned parenthood clinic we do n't mean the uninsured unemployed single mother battling depression who begs the heaven for a reprieve the president ha proposed a myriad of solution including expanded background check taken together his planned executive action may work to dampen the tide of gun closing the so called gun show loophole may hamper a straw purchaser 's ability to buy firearm in a state like indiana and later sell them on the street of chicago i lost my father and two brother to gun violence and all were killed with illegal handgun that were used in other crime growing up it wa all too easy to get a gun in our neighborhood in east st louis placing reasonable restriction on the most dangerous consumer product on the market is n't a violation of the second amendment it 's common sense however in this country suicide outnumber homicide almost two to one we should not forget that when an individual owns a gun they are more likely to kill themselves and or someone they love survival rate among those who attempt suicide by other mean such a a pill overdose or hanging are higher than for those who use a gun it is no accident that state where gun are most prevalent also report higher suicide rate according to the annals of internal medicine people who live in home with firearm are two to three time more likely to be murder victim or commit suicide we can debate the notion that more 'good guy with gun is the answer to violent crime or if the cast of solution proposed by the president will make a difference in practice there are no easy answer but we should try everything within the confines of the constitution if it will make it harder for criminal to stockpile gun we should impose more meaningful barrier to high capacity magazine and rapid fire weaponry if it mean curtailing a mass shooter 's ability to slaughter and maim if it mean more child will be safe walking to school in america that people can enjoy a prayer service at church or join their family for a night at the movie we should do it maybe a chicago 's father pfleger suggested during tonight 's town hall on cnn we should 'title gun like we title car tonight 's broadcast focused almost solely on the potential for homicide with little or no conversation about the thousand of people who take their own life each year but make no mistake a self inflicted gunshot wound is an act of violence my oldest daughter katie wa in the eighth grade the day i decided to die and i know that her message saved my life that year she would go on to be valedictorian of her graduating class and give an incredible speech at the ceremony today she is an ivy league alum an extraordinary schoolteacher and expecting her first child this fall when we talk about gun violence we almost always focus on the criminal aspect and forget the public health question we forget that there are thousand of gunshot victim who die by their own hand the president briefly broached the topic saying that while the majority of young homicide victim are black or latino the overwhelming majority of suicide by young people are white if we are to truly host a national conversation about gun violence and commit ourselves to real solution we can not forget the people who die alone in the dark they rarely make the news and like tonight too little attention is paid to their pain i am grateful for this life thankful for my child who are now taking the world on their own term i can not wait to hold my second grandchild too many american will miss moment like these we can do something about that,80812.0

710,9992583.0,2016-01-16T05:01:00+00:00,hey hillary end your cold war with the medium,so thursday night at pm while everyone wa watching the debate okay everyone who 's a weirdo politics junkie i wa watching'well the debate but then i happened to be up at am just in time for the rebroadcast of the rachel maddow show and i caught her interview with hillary clinton which i 'm guessing wa n't seen by many save my fellow insomniac and those devoted enough to the clinton cause to have dvr 'd it you should watch she wa good better than i 'd expected her to be under questioning that you would n't call mike wallace minute tough but that wa sober and on point and that challenged clinton on her recent trouble and charge against bernie sander and it made me think why in the world doe n't she do this more often like virtually every day just like all the other candidate actually she 's starting to we 'll get to that and the broader clinton medium strategy but first about thursday night maddow said to clinton correctly that her campaign 'set it hair on fire a little bit the previous afternoon by hosting a medium conference call to wag a big finger in bernie 's direction for going negative now madam secretary maddow rejoined that wa n't much of an attack ad it did n't even mention your name it wa just your basic compare and contrast here clinton could have gotten herself all riled up and continued the finger wag but she backed away to some degree saying the issue wa merely one of making sander say how he wa going to pay for thing 'i 've been laying out my plan i 've been telling you where i 'm gon na get the money i 've been telling you how much it 's gon na cost she said whereas sander ha not so much especially with respect to his medicare for all or single payer health plan this one shot up the chart this week after chelsea clinton clumsily and unwisely accused sander of wanting to do away with medicare and medicaid and 'strip million and million of their health insurance it wa foolish and kind of shocking and signaled panic and maybe the clinton campaign is panicked but a campaign never want to show panic it wa kind of disastrous questioned by maddow hillary clinton wa artful and specific it start at about in the link in my first paragraph sander she said had promised voter that he 'd release the detail of his plan before the iowa caucus and he ha n't done so yet and he should so voter have a way of comparing and contrasting their plan 'if he ha changed his mind about having the fed government pay percent of the cost and having state have to come up with the remaining percent when in fact we know republican governor wo n't even pay for medicaid expansion under obamacare which they 're going to get initially for nothing well that 's what we mean by raising these question i 'm not going to get down into the policy weed here a is usually the case there 's some truth to what both side are saying my point is that clinton came across a calm and authoritative which is like the magic tv combo so i wondered why doe n't she do this more often she is she also did a cnn sit down this week and she even called in donald style to morning joe oddly joe scarborough did n't even ask a question she only took two and she 's doing abc 's this week sunday she 's apparently hitting some of the sunday show this weekend so this is changing but it 's still a curiosity when she doe it mika brzezinski introduced clinton by saying what a big deal this wa what a 'long time in coming it wa i know why clinton ha n't done this more it 's because unlike most other candidate she doe n't need the exposure the free air time but mostly it 's because she doe n't like it doe n't want to field more email question know that that 's what will dominate the coverage but it play to her strength she 's at her best when she 's sitting somewhere talking calmly about important thing more importantly not doing tv in this day and age just doe n't hold up well all these other candidate do it the front runner on the other side doe it to excess calling scarborough to report a hangnail clinton need n't do that but why not get on there and mix it up a little the refusal ha felt remote and imperial it feed into that whole coronation perception whereas a candidate who 's out there submitting to question and defending her policy and statement on the medium that for better or worse shape our political discourse and go a long way toward defining what we think of these people is more likely to be seen a fighting for something it is true that her answer about email and bill 's wandering would dominate everything'at first but after about two week it would get old oh hillary 's on tv again which would be a good thing from her perspective she 'd benefit from getting her hand a little dirty in the mud where everybody else play she 's done maddow and hardball now but she should hit chris hayes she phoned into that one once and lawrence o'donnell and andrea mitchell too and she should do them more than once and she should do cnn regularly too although she need n't bother with fox or maybe once or twice some of them will lay a trap for her but by the third or fourth time she 's on morning joe or the sunday show it just wo n't be a big deal and she should keep doing the ellen degeneres and amanda de cadenet thing of course even though those do n't help much with the political class jimmy fallon which she did the other night help more with that set on friday morning nate silver still had her percent likely to win iowa and percent likely to take new hampshire but some poll show she 's clearly lost some ground in the last month so something 's not working she get a lot of negative press coverage le so since the email story ha quieted but it still ai n't great while sander get almost nothing but positive coverage we know why both of those thing happen it 's because the press doe n't like her and she doe n't like it it 's a cold war and ha been for year well it 's not serving her well and it 's pretty obviously in her interest to try to end it the way to start is to take woody allen 's advice about what

creative way to get around second amendment protection on gun the tax ha passed it first court test signaling an approach that other municipality could adopt with a tax on every firearm sold in the city two cent on every round of caliber ammunition and a cent tax for every other round of ammunition the tax went into effect on january st after surviving a challenge from the nra and other gun right group when king county superior court judge palmer rubinson ruled in december that the city of seattle ha the 'constitutional and legislative authority to impose tax ' which a she noted is separate from the city 's ability to regulate gun city attorney pete holmes wa initially surprised the nra did n't ask for a stay in the judge 's ruling when filing it appeal monday in state court if the nra sought constitutional relief they would have appealed in federal court but from a legal standpoint this is n't about the constitution 'everybody assumes this is about the second amendment but it 's not and that 's the story holmes told the daily beast in a telephone interview 'no one is telling you that you ca n't own or buy a gun say holmes 'we believe we are in a safe haven we 're not regulating gun we 're simply adding a tax in seattle satisfying the second amendment is easier for gun safety advocate than clearing 'state preemption a legislative barrier that the national rifle association employ to block gun safety regulation in some three dozen state including washington it 's a short statute the gun right lobby writes and then muscle through state legislature say no other body such a the municipal authority in city like seattle can regulate firearm the nra 's institute of legal action ila churn out the statute and lawmaker in state after state are happy to oblige and with so many state legislature wholly owned subsidiary of the nra it 's an effective maneuver holmes say it wa the undoing of an executive order issued two seattle mayor ago banning firearm in city playground and park the court overturned the ban not under the second amendment but under state preemption so it is a big deal in seattle that this modest tax is in place and that the money it generates will go toward compiling data about gun violence and putting targeted intervention program in place after the sandy hook massacre of first grader seattle funded a study that found people with gun shot wound treated at harbor view hospital the regional trauma center are percent more likely to return with another gunshot or a a homicide victim the study wa the first of it kind done by a city and researcher found parallel with alcohol related injury in the early 's spending minute with patient injured in such incident before releasing them to talk about risk and their chance of being readmitted paid off in lower re admittance rate that is now considered best practice in all trauma center when it come to alcohol so could seattle do the same for gunshot victim it wa worth a shot and when the seed money ran out for the gun violence victim research and intervention program then city council president tim burgess a former seattle police officer proposed the gun violence tax to fund continued effort not all proponent of gun regulation are fully supportive of the seattle tax ralph fascitelli board president of washington ceasefire and a longtime gun safety advocate praise the tax a a 'good morale boost but say it is 'more symbolic than significant because gun buyer can easily avoid the tax by going outside the city limit for their purchase he would also rather see the money raised go toward smart gun technology than more research noting that his organization ha given it 'civic leader of the year award to both burgess and holmes he say 'they 're doing the best they can but they 're like houdini in a strait jacket getting oxygen at sea level is success asked for his response to the criticism burgess note that the tax will raise to a year to fund research and prevention program which is hardly chump change and while his friend fascitelli argues smart gun are prevention 'we 're not there yet say burgess also if people are counting many million are spent each year in uncompensated care at harbor view to care for gunshot victim and there 's no tax anybody dare to imagine at this point that would cover that seattle like every city in america is 'awash in gun say holmes 'we 're looking to do something to help reduce what is a public health issue automobile death are second to gun death in america for the first time in part he say because a a society we treated car accident a a problem we could solve he 'd like to see the same approach to gun 'i 'm a hayseed from virginia holmes say 'i go hunting i wa on the skeet and trap team in college i own gun i want to be able to talk to my friend from the rural area and tell them if you want an ar in the country you probably wo n't be doing much damage washington is an open carry state but when a bunch of people with loaded ar 's showed up at the state 's annual gay pride parade holmes say that 'spoiled the parade and alienated a lot of people that 's the kind of behavior that can get state with a deeply engrained pro gun culture to embrace new regulation washington passed a ballot measure in expanding background check gun group protested the new law by coming to the state capitol in olympia brandishing their gun and loudly objecting until the lieutenant governor banned bringing gun into the state house commonsense gun law are the new refrain and while they do n't go far enough for some people they look more achievable than they have in a long time more regulation are inevitable and the question now is how many crack will it take in the nra 's fa ade for it cloak of

fight isi an idea he 's pressed multiple time a a strategy to fight islamic extremism in the region it 's the middle east policy equivalent of a coexist bumper sticker sander ' proposal might sound promising to foreign policy lightweight'but those with expertise in the area know that the concept is deeply troubling 'these comment indicate sander lack of serious engagement with foreign policy issue while i appreciate his opposition to the iraq war perhaps if he wa a little more engaged with that issue he would understand the problematic element of his proposal said evan barrett a political adviser to the coalition for a democratic syria a syrian american opposition umbrella group sander ha preferred to stick to economic issue an environment that he is deeply familiar with but he ha been apparently unprepared to address national security topic a primary responsibility of the commander in chief position he is seeking his puzzling comment on how to fight isi are just the latest manifestation of his lack of foreign policy fundamental running against former secretary of state hillary clinton sander wa always going to be on the defensive when it came to foreign policy expertise but the vermont senator is n't doing himself any favor when he consistently argues for a leading state sponsor of terrorism to team up with it mortal adversary to fight isi an extremist group which iran 's own action are empowering sander ha repeatedly said the united state should not take the lead in the fight against isi but the unserious part of his proposal is the suggestion that he suggests saudi arabia and iran should work together to fight islamic extremism'seemingly oblivious to the schism in the region 'we have to understand that the muslim nation in the region'saudi arabia iran turkey jordan'all of these nation they 're going to have to get their hand dirty their boot on the ground they are going to have to take on isi this is a war for the soul of islam said sander at the democratic presidential primary debate in november but that wa n't just an off the cuff gaffe it 's a point the vermont senator ha repeated in press release for the past year the war against isi he said 'must be won primarily by nation in the region'saudi arabia turkey qatar kuwait jordan and iran ' which must be prepared to send ground troop into action to defeat islamic extremist sander ' campaign did not respond to request to clarify the senator 's strategy on isi the first problem with sander ' proposal is the vermont senator doe n't seem to recognize that there are is serious animus between certain muslim country saudi arabia and iran are currently deeply at odds and have been for quite some time in fact many sunni state in the middle east view iran 's growing regional power a a challenge rivaling that of isi itself'many american partner in the region such a saudi arabia and qatar would refuse to cooperate with iran since they believe that iranian aggression in iraq syria and yemen are contributing to the sectarianism that fuel isi 'sanders doe not understand that sunni nation are a concerned'if not more'about iranian hegemonic goal a they are with the threat of isi said michael pregent an adjunct fellow at the hudson institute and a former intelligence advisor to gen petraeus on iranian malign influence the most recent flare up of this tension earlier this month after the predominantly sunni saudi arabia executed a prominent shiite cleric sheikh nimr al nimr a group of iranian responded by storming the saudi embassy in tehran'the saudi responded by cutting off diplomatic tie with their rival 'in an environment where saudi arabia and iran are consistently at each other 's throat in multiple regional theater a presidential candidate with limited interest in foreign policy insisting that they work together because they are both muslim is deeply troubling and suggests grave ignorance barrett said both country are suspected of backing rival armed faction in syria'meaning that iran and saudi arabia arguably already have troop in syria in the form of proxy fighter that have prolonged the war and the suffering endured by the syrian people sander also doe n't seem to realize that iran already ha combat force in syria'and they have been a disaster for syrian civilian and are arguably pushing more of them towards isi 'iran already ha troop in syria and they are n't fighting isi they are providing an advisory and officer position level role for informal militia and hezbollah troop conducting operation against u s backed rebel ' and carrying out ethnic cleansing of sunni in regime stronghold barrett told the daily beast 'all these practice push sunni community towards isi and other extremist group despite the nuclear accord reached between the united state and iran it remains on the state sponsor of terrorism list designated by the state department to have repeatedly provided support for international terrorism but sander said that he want iran among other country to take a leading role against isi 'the u s and the international community should be fully supportive but the leadership in this war must come from the muslim world sander said in september pregent say that he 's alarmed that sander would cede regional leadership to iran 'sanders statement portend that he would outsource u s foreign policy in the middle east to

charge and some desperate speculation by fan legion of sci fi aficionado the 'x philes for whom the the x file remains the paragon of television this sunday evening one of the most culturally important and rabidly popular show in history'it spawned two feature length film and a m lange of comic book and video game nabbed emmy and golden globe and had potent influence on show such a buffy the vampire slayer and lost'will be resurrected for a episode appeasement of million of appetite created by chris carter and inspired primarily by the twilight zone alfred hitchcock present tale from the darkside and twin peak the x file aired from to it boasted a whopping installment split between self contained 'monster of the week episode and those that followed the show 's increasingly convoluted 'mythology an abuse of the term about a nefarious government coven in cahoot with extraterrestrial imperialists'those 'little green men you hear so much about although they 're actually alabaster sometimes silver'who planned to dragoon our planet the only two soul who stood between u and our vassalage to sinister ets were fbi agent fox mulder david duchovny who believed he 'd witnessed the ufo abduction of his sister when he wa a teen and whose lifework wa to chase down all specie of the paranormal in a maniacal quest for the truth and dana scully gillian anderson scientist medical doctor career skeptic and heroine of redhead everywhere scully wa misnamed after frank scully a pop author who wrote if that 's the word a preposterous book called behind the flying saucer published in the book wa responsible for inaugurating the trope held dear by conspiracy theorist and abduction nut everywhere the very trope that led to the x file alien ship crashed in desert clime tiny et corps government cover ups by shady agent put another way scully wa no scully it did n't seem to occur to frank scully and his unemployable ilk that if ets were bright enough to navigate through the innumerable danger of the cosmos they were n't dumb enough to crash in the arid nothingness of new mexico the x file wa like most sci fi and horror fare patently ridiculous any one of the event in any one of the episode wa enough to leave a person permanently stupefied and yet mulder and scully traipsed from one adventure to another with an ever renewable aplomb but to those of u with a hankering for mystery and conspiracy with an itch for the unknown for expert storytelling and production it wa also patently irresistible when the series ended in after nine season it wa the longest aired sci fi series in u s television history although for many of u the x file ended when duchovny fled the series after season it wa like listening to queen without freddie mercury you recognized the sound but the spirit wa all wrong the show 's outrageous success both confirmed our unkillable need of the supernatural and spread on a mass scale new edition of very old myth the motif were the same but the face had changed a civilization advanced not angel but alien not radiance from heaven but radiation from flying saucer when the old god stop working we craft new one by one avenue or another we will indulge the occult an intimation of the sublime is precisely what the x file tapped into mytho religious in it very dna it narrative fabric and also in it quasi heroic quest for transcendence or deliverance the decade old ufo craze is not only for the crazy that 's what mulder and scully became to million hero hunting the truth glimpsed in the extraordinary easy to deride for their na ve sincerity the fox mulders of the world are performer of our collective id the paranormal throb within the ancient structure of our psyche we downright demand that alien and monster give sound and scent and shape to our inky inwardness which is what jung meant by suggesting that the archetype of the human unconscious will one way or another find manifestation our creature myth and alien yearning are the astonishing story we tell ourselves in order to stave off the crush of the quotidian in order to seek the holy jung called the ufo phenomenon another instance of our desire for 'salvation from above true believer fox mulder manages to be so alluring despite being so convinced by every brand of hocus pocus because in the x file the hocus pocus is real vanity fair critic james wolcott writing in the year after the show premiered believed that 'like the twilight zone the x file express a national unease it also he wrote 'reflects the end of the millennium the flip side of the new age and there he wa summoning jung who surmised that ufo hysteria like all religious hysteria happens near the close of an epoch what 's more said wolcott 'nothing is put to rest on the x file the open endedness ' indicates not only the untrappable nature of these force but the show 's refusal to pronounce final judgment except that the show doe pronounce final judgment and that 's what career rationalist richard dawkins grumpily missing the point once objected to in the x file the judgment is always on the side of the otherworldly and paranormal the hunting of monster i 'm sad to say is a mostly male pursuit a old a the paleolithic and so the obsessive quester must be mulder and not scully the testosteroned thrill and peril of stalking beast remains encoded in male memory some of u have found that contrary to stereotype woman are much more sensible than men'throughout the s all of the originator of the ufo 'contactee bunk were men'and so chris carter made scully the embodiment of sober female reason the rationalist charged with trying to mitigate the recklessly boyish passion of fox mulder her character ha been credited with prompting woman to enter the science and no further evidence is needed for how fiction can tweak civilization for the better carter once quipped that the x file succeeds because mulder love scully and scully love mulder and that 's no feat of simplification 'all the world love a lover said emerson but part of the allure of the x file wa exactly because for the majority of the series mulder and scully were not lover not erotically entwined their love for one another wa ironclad but uncontaminated by the hormonal havoc the emotional jolt and mess of sex romantic sucker we watched each week for seven year wanting hoping to see them hug or touch titillated emboldened when they did rooting for a romance to rescue them from monster hunting hazard from their respective obsession we wanted normality and calm for them a we do for anyone we care about but of course normality and calm meant an end to their jaunt and thus an end to the show to their very existence our hope wa self mutilating when mulder pressed a tender kiss into scully 's lip one new year 's eve in the episode 'millennium from season some of u wept with giddy relief duchovny and anderson are unobtrusively beautiful and this is paramount to our abiding affection for their character it 's well nigh impossible to watch say chris hemsworth and natalie portman and not be diverted unconvinced by their aggressive beauty they both look cgi ed into immaculate existence mulder and scully do n't remind u of our neighbor no and they are similar to no one we 've ever met before'no everyman and everywoman'but they are exceedingly likable charismatic and somehow despite their eccentricity exceedingly normal in their sensibility in their reverence for the truth the opening sequence with it iconic echoing whistle concluded with the mantra 'the truth is out there although duchovny is a poor on screen crier he ha impeccable comedic timing the most charming episode of the x file are the silly ludic one those in which duchovny and anderson do n't balk at mocking their character their absurdist enterprise the often unmanageable tangle of their plotlines before moving to los angeles in season the series filmed in vancouver ' wooded rheumy vancouver such gray day the night an extended sentence you must serve'and the crew seeking the show 's original mood returned to vancouver to film the episode reboot why the deathless appeal of this show and it character the series played upon our common dread of the unknown and the frustratingly unknowable but it also played upon our troublous knack for embracing conspiracy our suspicion of corporation and government our spiritual thirst for the extraordinary that 's part of why the show remains in demand today because the quest of mulder and scully is a proxy for our own impotent spiritual longing because their dramatic travail and tender commitment to one another are exactly what 's missing from our own dull life in the late ' s the show asserted our myriad anxiety at the end of the millennium remember if you will the nonsense of y k now the world look rather different from how it did when the show concluded sloppily in not long after the incineration of world trade the atrocity on frightened u into relaxing our distrust of government we looked pantingly to our elected leader for reassurance for bodyguarding against a real world enemy who had drawn a bull 's eye on open society but true to form we 're once again abuzz with distrust the paranoia at work within the x file ha become more pointed more pressing edward snowden 's revelation of the nsa 's surveillance state julian assange 's international disruption via wikileaks drone like vulture overhead the technological leap taking place in every nook of our culture the near constant threat of terroristic mayhem both in our street and online in other word it 's the ideal time for the resurrection of the x files'no other show wa a smart or stylish at expressing our most irksome insecurity and our

every federal office holder from soliciting donation that republican rep david jolly is also running for the pivotal senate seat marco rubio is vacating in florida the fate of mitch mcconnell 's majority leader status could hinge on this race where in the early stage jolly appears to be on top of a three way gop race and jolly ha vowed not to ask for cash personally this election cycle which mean he 's handicapping the gop right out of the gate florida 's one of the most expensive state to run in and jolly 's move'or political stunt'will be a test case for whether individual candidate can win while protesting the world of washington fundraising or whether they need to fall in line to stay in office jolly 's new stop act would free up the portfolio of federal official by making it illegal for them to shake people down for money jolly 's putting his money where his mouth is and ha pledged to not personally ask for a cent this election cycle which could put his party in a bind because he 's the presumed frontrunner in the race to replace marco rubio in the senate 'what i 'm putting on the line is my existing seat and the fact that i 'm doing this a the frontrunner for the united state senate in the rd largest state in the country i 'm peeling the curtain back now and saying i 'm actually going to use the resource i have in congress to try to introduce legislation to fix this jolly said in frustration jolly 's move is sure to anger the republican establishment sitting in their smoke filled room at or near the capitol because florida 's senate seat is up for grab sure under his proposal and pledge to voter jolly 's surrogate can raise money for him but what he 's unveiling publicly today prohibits him and other lawmaker from asking for cash directly in order to force lawmaker to well actually make law jolly is n't new to washington but he is new to elected office since winning a special election in there 's one part of the job he particularly hate dialing for dollar 'you run for office based on some core conviction based on an agenda you want to get done and you 're immediately immersed in this system where the number one expectation is to spend your time raising money jolly told the daily beast in an exclusive interview where he previewed the legislation the slimey d c fundraising culture is familiar to jolly the attorney interned on the hill before he became one of those much decried washington lobbyist where he hedged his bet and donated to both democrat and republican jolly also served a chief of staff to former congressman bill young whose seat he now occupies young now deceased wa the longest serving republican in history at the time of his death he wa also the top appropriator for a slew of year at the end of his decade long career jolly 's race to replace young election attracted big money a democrat looked at the purple district a a potential pickup between his personal fundraising and what national republican dropped he wa sent to washington for a cool million democrat did n't sit on the sideline either they dropped another million on their candidate only to lose by a couple point while jolly wa n't afraid of corporate sponsorship while running'or while a a washington lobbyist'he maintains his perspective on fundraising changed once he formally took the oath of office 'as a first time candidate who wa not a sitting member for congress who had the time to run a full time campaign and fundraise i demonstrated i could do that jolly said 'and the moment i got to congress i wa told i had to double down and do even more of it that wa a very different scenario because now i 'm a sitting member of congress holding the public trust if jolly truly belief what he 's peddling he 's one of the few power broker in the nation 's capital to adhere to the logic party leader coach new lawmaker into spending more than half of their time raising money during the freshman orientation session for house democrat after the last presidential election the huffington post got a copy of a powerpoint that explicitly urged lawmaker to spend more than five hour a day fundraising while spending just two hour a day on legislative duty of course lawmaker ca n't use their federal office to solicit campaign cash but the open secret in washington is that mere foot away from the capitol ground are office that serve a phone bank for republican and democrat alike professional 'fundraisers coach lawmaker on who to call and provide them detail on who they 're chatting with so they can pretend to warmly remember their last fundraising plea 'it 's hard for individual people to unilaterally disarm which is actually what jolly 's doing said kyle kondik who track campaign for the university of virginia center for politics 'he 's potentially making it le likely he maximizes the amount of money he raise if he doe this pledge and stick with it jolly doe n't seem to mind that he 's going into unchartered territory 'jolly is not universally respected amongst washington republican campaign operative said kondik of jolly 's independent streak 'maybe that 's not necessarily a handicap but it 's the reality the proposal also doe n't do anything to change post citizen united world where ten of million of dollar now secretly flow to super pac it also doe n't prohibit lawmaker from attending fundraiser it merely make it so they ca n't make the fundraising pitch themselves so is jolly hoping super pac will carry the water for him and float is elite status a one of member of congress the math doe n't seem to add up 'you need actual real hard money for your campaign in order to pay everybody and also the candidate themselves get better rate on advertising than the super pac do kondik argues 'you ca n't really outsource your campaign to a super pac that 's why jolly maintains his bill is n't campaign finance reform it 's congressional reform 'the notion here is to get the member of congress back to work we ca n't have a part time congress in a full time world jolly said before adding that it also help clean up the nefarious optic that surround the glitzy world of washington fundraising circle 'it remove any appearance or suspicion of any impropriety with the member of congress directly soliciting a contribution the bold announcement of unilateral disarmament in the age of big money

regressing to their basest self the question is why and perhaps more importantly why now timing is everything here saudi arabia 's january execution of the shia cleric nimr al nimr a saudi national and vociferous critic of the regime wa a calculated provocative move iran the world 's premier shia state had repeatedly made it clear to riyadh that al nimr 's death would result in grave consequence and so it proved on the evening of january iranian protestors stormed the saudi embassy in tehran and set it alight police looked on clearly the storming had tacit approval from the iranian government before they eventually drove the protestors back but the damage had been done a short while later saudi arabia officially broke off diplomatic relation with iran since them sunni shia tension have been intensifying to even more dangerous level received wisdom say these event are merely the latest blow in a continuing sunni shia sectarian battle that is cleaving the middle east to a degree this is correct ten year ago jordan 's ruler king abdullah ii warned of the danger of what he termed the 'shia crescent 'the arc of majority or large minority shia community stretching from lebanon to bahrain the center of shia power jordan 's abdullah argued wa iran which ha since seen it influence grow dramatically following the iraq war iran now pursues an unashamedly aggressive foreign policy across the middle east whether it is fighting war in syria and yemen or trying to control the politics of iraq and lebanon saudi arabia the 'sunni lion which is both the richest and with egypt destabilized the most powerful sunni state in the region ha sought to counterbalance iran in all these area the saudi are terrified of iranian hegemony and a few year back even urged the u s to cut off the head of the snake by striking iran 's nuclear program saudi arabia and iran are now effectively fighting proxy war in several theater across the middle east since the july nuclear deal between iran and the p the five un security council power and germany which will end the international sanction on iran saudi fear of increased iranian power have only deepened while relation with washington have deteriorated in saudi eye president barack obama ha chosen attempt at d tente with iran over washington 's longstanding tie with riyadh the country now view itself a largely alone in the fight against iran so the animosity is very real on both side but in truth it is often more political than religious both country see themselves a natural leader of the islamic middle east and geostrategic competition between the two see each use the trope and language of religion to cloak what are in truth political end iran is especially good at this calling on shia jihadis to go to syria ostensibly to protect the sayyidah zaynab shrine near damascus but in reality to help safeguard syrian president bashar al assad and in so doing secure iran 's land bridge through syria to hezbollah in lebanon set in this context these latest development become more easily understandable that they are political is undoubted what make them so interesting is that this time it is domestic factor that have pushed each side to ratchet up hostility since the iran deal which saw washington seemingly willing to ignore saudi concern regarding iran 's nuclear program the saudi are feeling more isolated than they have in a long time and the timing could not be worse at a barrel oil price are at their lowest since the s'a serious blow to the country 's economy riyadh is now facing an unprecedented billion budget deficit and wa recently forced to raise gas price by percent this is dangerous for a state that keep it population largely quiet by extensive state subsidy and high paying job if it ability to bribe it population effectively into quiescence is threatened then the stability of the state itself is at risk added to this the recent ascension of king salman to the throne ha seen the kingdom introduce a new more aggressive foreign policy notably through military action in yemen that ha so far proved costly with little result with tension at home and foreign policy failure abroad the regime need to make sure that it people do not become restless and do the unthinkable start to question their leader what the regime need is a distraction and there is no better distraction that the shia enemy'the bogeyman that is almost guaranteed to unite sunni both domestically and across the middle east in this sense when the iranian allowed their people to violate all norm of diplomatic protocol by storming the saudi embassy in tehran they played right into saudi hand but they did so willingly khamenei ha his own point to prove to his people and to the watching world and just like the saudi he ha used al nimr 's execution to make it khamenei had needed the nuclear deal to lift sanction on iran but this need brought with it significant danger namely that he risked compromising the islamic republic 's core principle of defiance in the face of the great satan the u s khamenei ha to prove to the hardliner that back him that while iran may be opening up to the global economy it will remain true to it root and there is no better way to show the world that the islamic republic remains a foe of 'imperialism than storming an embassy the symbolism is inescapable recalling a it doe the hostage crisis when iranian protestors stormed the u embassy in tehran and held those inside captive for day allowing the saudi embassy to be stormed ha enabled khamenei to achieve two thing one he ha increased anti saudi feeling in iran'the low oil price also drastically affect the iranian economy and the mullah can do with a distracting bogeyman of their own two he ha reassured his base that the islamic republic is not going 'soft after compromising over it nuclear program but while both power are concerned with shoring up their domestic base the latest crisis between them could not have come at a worse time for the middle east last october the saudi and iranian finally came together in vienna for peace talk designed to try to end the syrian civil war with both country so heavily invested in the war'iran back assad and the saudi back sunni opposition group determined to oust him'there is little chance of a sustainable peace without their input talk are supposed to continue on jan but since al nimr 's execution sectarian rhetoric from both side ha increased and fellow sunni gulf state have also broken off relation with iran on jan saudi foreign minister adel al jubeir wa uncharacteristically confrontational 'we will not allow iran to destabilize our region he told reuters 'we will not allow iran to do harm to our citizen or those of our ally and so we will react iran saudi relation are at their lowest point since the late s and this enmity now threatens to derail the upcoming talk official are worried steffan de mistura the u n envoy to syria wa clear on the gravity of the situation 'we can not afford to lose this momentum despite what is going on in the region he said given that the two country are already backing different horse in syria the latest crisis is likely to make the admittedly distant prospect of a solution in syria even more remote,7680.0

roughly onesies parent will need some of this and some they can do without one thing absolutely nobody need a 'smart baby bottle and yet unto this utterly non existent breach ride a san diego based start up thrive feeding ha raised half a million dollar in it quest to market product that will supposedly help parent tell if their baby are healthy eater or not 'the story of thrive wa that we came into it knowing we could make a newborn feeding device that would be efficient simple and intelligent and would actually tell mother how healthy their baby wa from a feeding perspective founder brian wadsworth told mobihealthnews 'there is nothing available to the healthcare system or to mother themselves that directly tell them that their baby is a healthy feeder or if it 's not a healthy feeder give any clue a to why not i sit in stupefied amazement at that statement a it happens there is rather a robust presence within the healthcare system for telling mother and also father if their baby is a healthy feeder they are called 'pediatricians and there are quite a number of u we are very happy to offer guidance for all manner of feeding concern but really for the vast majority of parent the question of whether or not their child is a healthy eater requires very little professional oversight at all particularly for bottle fed infant pretty much every bottle on the market today ha little mark on the side that will tell mom and dad the volume of formula or breast milk their child is offered and how much they have consumed if your baby is taking an age appropriate number of ounce and your pediatrician is glad to review that amount with you on a relatively consistent schedule then the healthy feeder issue is easily settled if the baby is gaining weight at a good clip i am at a loss to determine what other information might be helpful doe your baby bottle hold liquid check can you attach a nipple check congratulation you have all the element required while there is a variety of additional feature you can find and some baby take better to one style or another the basic are pretty universal not to be outdone by advance in container science however maker of formula itself are also in pursuit of product needed by no one to wit the gerber babynes a keurig like apparatus that promise a 'brilliant future for baby lucky enough to be fed by one parent pop in a pod of various different formula that are 'perfectly in sync with baby 's development which appear to vary every few week or month customer can sign up for additional service like weight tracker and convenient reminder to order more capsule of formula if this article could include sound clip here is where i would insert one of me pounding my head against my desk even for parent who opt for the burden of mixing water and scoop of powder which take whole minute to accomplish the array of formula variety now available can be dizzying stroll down the aisle of baby product at your local supermarket and witness the stunning number of different label there are some advertised to control fussiness and others for mother who choose to supplement their nursing with formula there are yet more that supposedly meet the nutritional need of toddler when parent ask me about these product i tell them they 're to ensure their child receives the recommended daily allowance of marketing the fact of the matter is that whatever purported benefit promised by the different formula they do not remotely justify the increase in price point when my oldest child wa an infant i stood in the aisle at target and compared an expensive name brand with the generic variety they were identical ingredient by ingredient absent a medical need for a different formula the store brand is what i recommend to my patient now for toddler there 's milk the clue a to why these product exist and why a 'smart bottle may be on the horizon is hidden in something wadsworth said about the goal for his new gizmo specifically he said 'the philosophy of the product is to treat feeding a a performance issue because god forbid we treat child rearing a something other than a series of performance issue starting with natural childbirth and ending with an ivy league degree the apotheosis of this mindset came a while ago in the form of an essay by a mother who kept spreadsheet of every last little thing her infant daughter did from quality of poop to how attentive she seemed when her parent read issue of popular science to her after 'quantifying her child thusly the author pressed her pediatrician to give her daughter some kind of score in response he told her she needed to chill out peace be upon you wherever you are unnamed colleague this doe not stop her from congratulating herself for giving the best kind of attention to her kid in contrast to other mother she describes in the piece stop trying to optimize your child parent of america and stop telling them to ought to be everyone else obviously we all want our child to grow and succeed and flourish we want them to be healthy and happy and strive to give them all we can in order to make those thing happen obsessing and tracking and monitoring are inextricably linked to parenting certainly in today 's society but speaking a both a pediatrician and a parent kid love nothing more than to take our expectation and dance giddily upon them until nothing is left but a fine dust scrutinizing every time they whimper or pas gas will not guarantee admission to princeton and a vast number of people would n't be happy there anyway we need to stop acting a though child require a prospectus both for their sake and our own it is neither good for child nor effective to maximize arbitrary factor in search of some perfect outcome measure love your kid feed them a healthy diet encourage them to exercise and socialize read and play if immediately after they 're born they lose a little weight maybe your provider will tell you to keep track of their feeding and pooping for a short time but then let it go but skip the spreadsheet and the newfangled bottle,7343.0

at stake in november hrc president chad griffin said in a statement 'while they fight to take u backwards hillary clinton is fighting to advance lgbt equality across our nation and throughout the world we are proud to endorse hillary clinton for president and believe that she is the champion we can count on in november'and every day she occupies the oval office according to national poll number average from real clear politics the endorsement wa a safe bet although she appears to be losing momentum clinton is still beating her democratic opponents'leading her closest rival sen bernie sander by point she remains the frontrunner buoyed by her status a the mainstream alternative to sander ' far left view and in a statement sander argued that the human right campaign endorsement while a frustrating choice given his record on lgbt right is an indicator of her status a the 'establishment pick 'what we are doing in this campaign it just blow my mind every day because i see it clearly we 're taking on not only wall street and economic establishment we 're taking on the political establishment sander said 'some of these group are in fact a part of the establishment the statement may have proven controversial on the internet but bernie sander is both absolutely right and completely missing the point the human right campaign ha long been criticized by queer activist a the embodiment of 'big gay politics marginalizing the interest of trans folk and people of color in favor of issue that favor rich white gay men but in distancing himself from the politics of the mr clinton and the 'establishment that support her he fails to recognize that his own history on the issue is hardly radical while the human right campaign pushed the issue of marriage equality and gay

in the employment non discrimination act first introduced to congress by sen gerry studds d mass back in the bill sought to prohibit identity based workplace discrimination'meaning that employer would no longer be able to fire someone or prevent them from being hired on the basis of their lgbt status but the human right campaign 's then executive director elizabeth birch opposed offering those protection to transgender worker stating it would happen 'over her dead body a transgriot 's monica robert explains birch 's opposition wa based on an old tactic of gay right leader by throwing trans people under the bus they hoped to make bill like enda more palatable to the mainstream'in cutting out such 'extreme language the gay liberation front 's jim fouratt used the same exact argument to oppose trans inclusion in a anti discrimination measure while chad griffin the current president of the human right campaign ha publicly apologized to the community for the organization 's historically bad record on trans right the hrc ha still struggled to overcome it own legacy of discrimination during a rally in support of same sex marriage the group asked attendee not to display a flag representing the trans community according to mic 's maribel hermosillo hrc worker told them that 'marriage equality is n't a trans issue in addition to sidelining trans voice in favor of

urged in a essay for the huffington post if those leaning put clinton at odds with the economic interest of many lgbt people her queer advocacy ha also been the product of establishment thinking during the s hillary clinton supported both do n't ask do n't tell and the defense of marriage act a pair of bill that respectively barred gay from military service and restricted the legal definition of 'marriage to the union between a man and a woman both policies'which were wildly popular at the time'were instituted during her husband 's tenure a president during her successful new york senate run in clinton continued to back doma'although she would distance herself from the bill during her campaign for the white house this wa a time when most american still opposed full legal recognition for same sex couple but a public opinion shifted so did hillary clinton 's opinion on the subject may marked the first time in history a majority of u s citizen at percent supported marriage equality and just month later clinton would announce she too had 'evolved on the issue she finally came out in support of marriage equality in in contrast with clinton 's 'wait and see approach sander ha touted himself a ahead of the curve on queer equality last may sander explained to the new york time that he did n't have to 'come around to the issue 'i 'm not evolving when it come to gay right he said 'i wa there leaning on his track record is a familiar argument for the vermont senator who also tout his history on civil right a proof that he stand with the goal of the blacklivesmatter campaign but whether he like it or not he 's been just a much a participant in 'establishment politics a the group that he 's criticizing sander voiced support for gay right in an early s open letter and opposed doma and while he wa ahead of his time on both count neither of these stance showed an explicit concern for lgbt people instead his appeal were based on government overreach and constitutional ground ' t here are entirely too many law that regulate human behavior he wrote in the letter 'let u abolish all law which attempt to impose a particular brand of morality or 'right ' on people in response to sander ' 'no vote against the defense of marriage act his wife jane sander specified that it wa not an identity based decision instead her husband felt that it constituted a violation of the legal jurisdiction granted to individual state to decide marriage law 'we 're not legislating value mr sander argued 'we have to follow the constitution according to the huffington post ' bernie sander ' spokesman michael briggs made the case ' that sander ha been way ahead of clinton'and pretty much everyone'in advocating same sex marriage but that 's simply not true in an essay for slate mark joseph stern writes 'as mayor of burlington in sander told an interviewer that lgbt right were not a 'major priority ' for him he opposed marriage equality throughout the s calling it a 'divisive issue and maintaining his support for civil union before eventually coming around in and although vermont would become the first state to pas civil union in his support for that groundbreaking measure wa n't about making history for same sex couple but based in the exact same mindset protecting state ' right sander finally 'evolved on marriage four year before hillary clinton'the length of an entire presidential term'but it 's hardly the lightyears ahead of it time stance his campaign is touting whether or not he like to admit it that mean the progressive senator ha more in common with clinton and the human right campaign than he 'd like to believe and when lgbt voter go to help choose the democratic nominee they 'll ultimately be faced with a choice between two imperfect champion for equality,19829.0
