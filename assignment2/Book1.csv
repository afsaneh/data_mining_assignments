9546141,2016-01-01T04:47:00+00:00,Kanye West Releases Awful New Song on New YearÉ??s Eve,Is Drake inside Kanye WestÉ??s head? ThatÉ??s the impression one gets after listening to É??FactsÉ?ù a schizophrenic new song Yeezy released onto his SoundCloud page a few hours before the New YearÉ??s Eve ball drop. A sample of the chorus to FatherÉ??s ChildrenÉ??s 1989 ditty É??Dirt and GrimeÉ?ù segues into swirling low-register beats with twinkling ivory accompaniment supplied by producers Metro Boomin and Southside. É??Yeezy Yeezy Yeezy just jumped over É??JumpmanÉ??É?ù raps West mimicking DrakeÉ??s flow on the track É??JumpmanÉ?ù off his bestselling mixtape with Future What a Time to Be Alive. Like É??FactsÉ?ù that tune was produced by Metro BoominÉ??and three of the tracks off WATTBA came courtesy of Southside so here West has decided to reappropriate Drake and FutureÉ??s knob wizards in the service of a long meandering aside about his corporate woes. West has made no secret of his disdain for shoemaker Nike who hosted the release of his Air Yeezys back in 2009 followed by the Air Yeezy IIs. Following the release of his Red Octobers West left Nike furious over his lack of design power and meager compensation for the sneakersÉ??since the brand refused to cut him in on the profitsÉ??and moved over to Adidas. This brings us back to É??FactsÉ?ù parts of which play like a diss track against the swoosh. É??If Nike ainÉ??t had Drizzy man they wouldnÉ??t have nothinÉ??!É?ù West shrieks followed later on by É??IÉ??ve been trending years yÉ??all a couple days. Yeezy in the house and we just got appraised. Nike treat employees just like slaves.É?ù Drake had a huge 2015 with two of his mixtapes hitting No. 1 If YouÉ??re Reading This ItÉ??s Too Late and What a Time to Be Alive. On top of that he made an example out of Nicki MinajÉ??s cabana boy Meek Mill and the silly music video for his É??Hotline BlingÉ?ù went viral boosting the song up the charts. ItÉ??s DrakeÉ??s biggest hit single yet. The Canadian MC also forged lucrative corporate bonds with Apple and Nike and a romantic one with the most dominant athlete alive Serena Williams. Oh and Drizzy grew a beard and got ripped perhaps in an attempt to silence those who feel the hybrid rap/R&B star is softer than a pair of baby thighs. So itÉ??s understandable that despite their lovely moment with Will Smith at DrakeÉ??s OVO Fest Yeezy feels his throne may be in jeopardy. After all the Yeezy Boosts aside WestÉ??s professional 2015 mostly consisted of dropping a bizarre Jedi-inspired fashion line a few forgettable singles joining forces with the flailing Tidal and announcing a pseudo-presidential run at the VMAs. All of this may explain why É??FactsÉ?ù has DrakeÉ??s fingerprints all over it from the sneak-release on SoundCloud to employing the WATTBA producers to sending up DrakeÉ??s flow on É??Jumpman.É?ù Kanye is at his best when heÉ??s angry and inspired not nervous. É??FactsÉ?ù is littered with poorly-conceived rhymes from É??I stuck to my Roots IÉ??m like Jimmy FallonÉ?ù to É??Do anybody feel bad for Bill Cosby? Did he forget the names just like Steve Harvey?É?ùÉ??though referencing HarveyÉ??s Miss Universe flap indicates the track was finished quite recently. The disappointing song does end with a glimmer of hope however with West hinting that he might open his own hotel presumably filled with Le Corbusier lamps. Sign me up. ,29478
9544391,2016-01-01T05:01:00+00:00,Why Everybody Should Work in Hollywood,IÉ??m convinced that working in Hollywood is the most effective and efficient way to teach people how to work. You have to work well under constant pressure. You have to be responsible for more things than anyone should have to be responsible for. And you have to be cunning. IÉ??ve worked in the development and production of major motion pictures and television then switched over to working in content at an advertising agency and now work as a creative director at a media company but in all my travels the most incredible workers were those who got their start in the film & television biz. When I think about the things that make me good at my job I can trace them back to what I learned being at the bottom of the food chain in Hollywood and fighting my way up. HereÉ??s what I learned: There is no other option. If you arenÉ??t good with your time and you canÉ??t stay organized youÉ??ll never make it in this town. ItÉ??s too fast thereÉ??s too much happening and itÉ??s too demanding. You are in the office before your boss and stay long after. You are the manager and keeper of every aspect of their life É?? their schedule their calls their projects their meetings and yes their personal stuff. I had a boss who expected me to make sure their car was always filled with gas. If they ever left the studio and didnÉ??t have enough gas to get where they were going it was my fault (I had to occasionally ask for their keys go to their studio spot turn on their car check for the levels and drive to the gas station if it was low and pray I didnÉ??t crash the car). I knew another assistant who had to always drive their boss to a waxing appointment because they wanted to take a Xanax. Another had to take their bossÉ??s online traffic school for them when they got a ticket. You are their keeper (of their lives and their secrets). And because youÉ??re busy managing their lives your life takes a backseat. I would forget things like friendsÉ?? birthdays or to pay bills. On top of that I also read every incoming script so IÉ??d get in an additional two hours early to make sure I could knock two out before I even started my regular day. I suffered in my first Hollywood assistant gig because everything took me longer than the other assistants at the studio. I pride myself at being an organized person but I didnÉ??t grasp the kind of organized my boss needed me to be É?? it was their office not mine. Not only is there just so much to do and keep track of you need to learn to do it their way. I tried all sorts of methods to help this boss stay organized until we finally came to the conclusion that maybe we just werenÉ??t a match. Our personalities were too different and I was too far down the spiral to be able to pick myself up and come back I felt defeated. It was heartbreaking. I had always been reliable smart efficient and well wanted. And here I was a lowly assistant whose duties I thought I should be able to easily master questioning my work ethic. But it did make me better. I was more prepared to deal with job #2. It was a fresh start and I went in eyes open on learning how to work with a specific kind of personality how to deliver on unique expectations and how to stop negative thinking affect my work. I was a machine at my next job and while that one had a new set of challenges I am still astounded at how much I got done each day. When I moved into other roles at adjacent industries I was SHOCKED to see such poor follow through. Great ideas flowed but the hustle and accountability lacked. When youÉ??re dealing with the desperation and starvation when it comes to Hollywood dreams people will do whatever it takes to get those dreams actualized. I learned that I was the only one responsible for making things happen and no one was going to do that but me. By climbing the ladder of success producing a film or getting a project off the ground I realized the ability to just get things done was an invaluable skill. You have to constantly make decisions and quickly and not fuck up. Should I interrupt Boss in their current meeting that they told me not to interrupt them for but if I donÉ??t theyÉ??ll lose out on this script? High Profile Celebrity is scheduled for a dinner with Boss and when you confirmed the reservation the restaurant didnÉ??t have it and now what? Should I tell Boss they have some personal messages on the answering machine when thereÉ??s a very graphic one a friend sent and if I tell them weÉ??ll both know I heard it but if I donÉ??t will they not get it? Every day. Constantly. Exhaustively. There are choices to be made some important some not so much except in Hollywood itÉ??s all important. Because when you fuck up in Hollywood it makes your life so much more miserable than any other industry because thereÉ??s no room for mistakes. They are unforgivable. The irony: the only way to learn how not to fuck up IS to fuck up. But you also make other decisions a lot faster É?? about yourself. While your peers dawdle for months or years figuring out what theyÉ??re good at or what they love the pressure cooker of Hollywood speeds up that process for you. Because youÉ??re constantly fucking up you figure out quickly how to not fuck up. Since youÉ??re feeling the wrath of fucking up all the time you learn about what kind of boss you want to be in the future (or in my case what kind of boss I absolutely didnÉ??t want to be). And because you figure out what you do and no not want to put up with you make choices about the career you want the work that interests you and the things in your life that matter a lot faster. I once got my dream jobÉ?? or rather what I thought was my dream job except I was in tears every night because my boss at the time was such an awful human and made my life miserable. But that misery taught me a lot the biggest is that I now have a É??no assholeÉ?ù policy. It doesnÉ??t matter the work or the job I now only work with people I enjoy spending time with and for bosses I like and respect. You have to learn every agentÉ??s name and the names of their assistant of the week. You need to know who the current hot writers are their entire body of work and you better have read it all too. You need to remember who É??the peopleÉ?ù are of the celebrities you work with (managers agents PR reps etc) their kidsÉ?? names their birthdays and their blood type. You need to know everyoneÉ??s name on set and have their contact information at the ready. The point is you need to remember volumes and volumes of information. And I donÉ??t mean just have Google at the ready É?? YOU need to be ready. When your boss asks you you have less than a second to respond. No time for you to go digging through your phone or notebook you just have to know. And you know what? You get pretty good at it. I did. I became a sponge. I learned all those names and kept track of who was moving to other agencies or studios. When I worked on sets I made a mini version of the crew list and callsheets laminated them and kept them on a key ring around my neck. I was always ready for whatever information I needed to conjure up in a moment. And I still have a reputation for being a steel trap. I trained my brain to be like that and itÉ??s served me incredibly well. Because of the pace of life (the pressure cooker the harsh hours the personalities) you learn to be detailed and get to the point. Boss canÉ??t be expected to remember everything (thatÉ??s your job É?? see previous point) and has better things to do than talk to you so you are always detailed in your communication. You donÉ??t just say É??your 1pm is hereÉ?ù (the standard time for a Hollywood lunch). You say É??your 1pm lunch with High Profile Celebrity is just pulling up to the lot so theyÉ??re about five minutes out and IÉ??ve laid out lunch in the conference room (and yes no mayo).É?ù You donÉ??t just say youÉ??re almost done with script coverage. You say youÉ??re almost done with É??X script that came in Tuesday by Big Writer and Y script by Lesser Known Writer that came in today and everyone is talking about it so theyÉ??ll have coverage for both by 8pm.É?ù There is no room for follow-up questions that will annoy Boss or for speeches. And if theyÉ??re asking about something? YouÉ??ve already failed. You fucked up. I had a boss that would tell me five times a day É??constant updatesÉ?ù and I have their voice in my head to this day. They wanted to know exactly what was happening with everything throughout the day and if they had to ask they were pissed. I needed to be on the ready and find the moments throughout the day to proactively update them. Speaking of being proactive itÉ??s the game changer in all of this. On my first internship I watched in awe as efficient assistants would organize something because they saw a need for it on top of their mountains of work without being asked. I know that sounds pretty basic but it was a great lesson to learn so young. You werenÉ??t going to get anywhere by doing just whatÉ??s asked of you É?? you need to step it up. Because this is Hollywood and weÉ??re all starving. So be better than the person next to you be indispensable and be proactive when it comes to making your boss and everyone else at the companyÉ??s lives better. See what needs fixing and just FIX IT. I apply the same skills in a senior role when it comes to growing a team growing a business and making things better and more efficient. ItÉ??s also the only way youÉ??re going to get promoted out of that assistant role É?? the only thing that matters. YouÉ??ll put up with screamers manipulators phonies people that get away with shit that makes you look around incredulously at everyone else thatÉ??s allowing them to act that way people that only want to be friends with you because of where you work celebrities you need to function around even if theyÉ??re your heroes and people treating you and hitting on you in ways that would be deemed incredibly unprofessional and liable in any other industry. You let it all roll off you. You have to. Because you tell yourself if youÉ??re miserable for just this one year this one job the payoff will be big. So you endure. Because itÉ??s all a game the most difficult game on the planet. In Hollywood he who lasts the longest makes it. And you realize the fucking up the crazies the long hours and the immense effort it all takesÉ??thatÉ??s what makes you better the best. Because the biggest thing it teaches you is to keep pushing keep fighting keep getting better keep learning. ,24939
9544392,2016-01-01T05:01:00+00:00,Bill Cosby Tamir Rice And The Power of Prosecutors,What do Bill Cosby and Tamir RiceÉ??s have in common? Their cases reveal the immense power of prosecutors. Consider the fact that in 2005 Andrea Constand told police that Bill Cosby gave her drugs and sexually assaulted her. Why wasnÉ??t he charged? The prosecutor didnÉ??t think there was enough evidence. Ten years later Cosby is charged. Why? Partly because of new bits of evidenceÉ??CosbyÉ??s admission that he sometimes gave women drugs in order to have sex with them and at least 50 other accusations against him. But mostly because now thereÉ??s a different prosecutor Kevin Steele. These are judgment calls in 2005 and 2015. Now consider the cases of Tamir Rice Michael Brown and Eric Garner. None of the police officers responsible for their deaths were ever chargedÉ??not convictedÉ??charged. In all three cases prosecutors practically told grand juries not to indict. In Ferguson Robert McCulloch decided to simply present all the evidence to the grand jury rather than make a case against Officer Darren Wilson. In Staten Island Darren Donovan a Republican with extensive ties to the police department failed to secure an indictment against Daniel Pantaleo whose chokehold led to Eric GarnerÉ??s death. And most recently in Cleveland Tim McGinty stated openly that he didnÉ??t believe anyone should be charged in the shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice. Set aside for the moment the facts of these cases. WhatÉ??s striking in all of them is that county prosecutors and district attorneys singlehandedly and without oversight decide the fates of the accused. More judgment calls unreviewed and unreviewable. True there is some oversight: most of these prosecutors are elected. If voters donÉ??t like how theyÉ??re doing (or not doing) their jobs they can vote them out of office. Indeed in the case of Bill Cosby then-D.A. Bruce CastorÉ??s decision not to indict in 2005 became an issue in his election battle with Kevin Steele this year. But is this really É??oversightÉ?ù? As The Daily Beast reported last September voters often know next to nothing about the candidates running for positions as prosecutors or judges. Turnout is extremely low especially in off years. And when voters are paying attention they are bamboozled by the only campaign message that seems to work: É??tough on crime.É?ù This year for example Steele ran on his É??98 percent conviction rateÉ?ù and É??tough sentences for sexual predators.É?ù ThatÉ??s what people want right? They see prosecutors as agents of the criminal justice system and everyone wants less crime. This leads to two perverse incentives for prosecutors. First they have an incentive to over-charge criminal defendants and secure convictions more than justice. Second they have an incentive not to charge police officers who after all are fighting crime every day and with whom they work closely on a daily basis. In principle if Officers Pantaleo Wilson and Loehmann violated the law then they are criminals. But in practice they are policemen and perceived as the opposite of criminals. Voters who want to get tough on crime do not want to get tough on cops. So not only is there no meaningful oversight of prosecutors but the oversight that does exist is skewed to specific outcomes and behaviors not impartiality and performance. Now back to Cosby. If you pay close attention to what Steele said this week youÉ??ll notice that he went out of his way to mention the new evidence that has come to light in the last twelve months. É??A prosecutorÉ??s job is to follow the evidence wherever it leads and whenever it comes to lightÉ?ù he said announcing the arrest. In part this was to explain the nearly twelve-year gap between the crime and the charge. But in large part it was to explain why Cosby is being charged in 2015 but wasnÉ??t in 2005. And what is that new evidence? Only what is known as É??habit evidenceÉ?ù: that Cosby admitted to drugging and having sex with other women. But not ConstandÉ??however ludicrous it may seem CosbyÉ??s position is that she consented. Is habit evidence really enough to reopen a closed case and file charges? Again thatÉ??s another judgment call. Like Judge RobrenoÉ??s decision to unseal the damning deposition records SteeleÉ??s decision was basically up to him. Of course Steele chose to make it an election issue as well. HeÉ??d look foolish if having just accused Bruce Castor of doing nothing he did nothing too. But again that was SteeleÉ??s decision. Just as prosecuting É??AmericaÉ??s DadÉ?ù in 2005 might have made Castor loo bad prosecuting AmericaÉ??s Rapist in 2015 makes Steele look good. We imagine that district attorneys and other prosecutors are motivated by truth justice and the American way. But in fact they are elected officials who paint in broad strokes for a mostly-ignorant public who unlike judges cannot be held accountable for their misconduct by oversight boards and who exercise discretion so broad that the disposition of justice often lies entirely within their judgment. Finally of course Tamir Rice and Bill Cosby have more in common than under-zealous prosecutors: both African American males one quite young and one quite old operating in a system in which 95 percent of prosecutors are white and local police forces are 88 percent white. For decades Cosby was protected by his wealth celebrity class and connections particularly at Temple University. But he is the exception not the rule. Black men comprise 6 percent of the U.S. population but 35 percent of the prison population. They receive sentences roughly 10 percent more severe than white defendants convicted of identical crimes. And when they are perceived to be older than they are bigger than they are more dangerous than they are or more violent than they are their 88 percent-white police officers and 95 percent-white-prosecutors exercise É??discretionÉ?ù in remarkably similar ways. The United States is the only country in the world that elects prosecutors based on sloganeering and then holds them to no standard other than majority whim. After nearly 12 years Bill Cosby has indeed been charged with a crime. But only because a prosecutor decided to do soÉ??this time. ,13595
9544393,2016-01-01T05:01:00+00:00,Translating the É??IliadÉ??? Who IsnÉ??t.,Pop quiz: Which is greater? (a) The number of Republican presidential candidates or (b) the number of new English translations of HomerÉ??s Iliad published in the last decade. If you answered (a) youÉ??d be right but by a very slim margin. Last month with the arrival of Caroline AlexanderÉ??s version of HomerÉ??s great epicÉ??the first ever by a woman if that mattersÉ??the Iliads drew just just one shy of the nine Republican contenders who appeared in DecemberÉ??s debate. Given the increasingly rapid pace at which new Iliads keep emerging we will likely see another before the Iowa caucusesÉ??all this while older versions of the poem some dating back centuries continue to get reissued with new notes introductions and cover illustrations. For readers and for teachers like myself the range of choice has become bewildering. Some translators prefer a five-beat line of verse (like ShakespeareÉ??s) others something closer to the six-beat line of the original still others blend the two or as in AlexanderÉ??s case stick to no clear metrical scheme at all (É??a cadenceÉ?? which varies from verse to verseÉ?ù as she describes it in her introduction). Do you fancy rhymed couplets? The once-great versions by George Chapman and Alexander Pope have been recently repackaged as has the prose version by Victorian novelist Samuel Butler. And for those who prefer modernist twists on ancient classics Christopher LogueÉ??s War MusicÉ??a reimagining of HomerÉ??s epic in an imagistic styleÉ??will appear in a new more complete version next month augmented by material Logue left unfinished in his declining years after working on the poem on and off for five decades. Translation proliferation is certainly not among the 10 worst of the anxieties afflicting the modern world but it is of a piece with others higher up the list. Swarthmore psychologist Barry Schwartz begins his 2005 book The Paradox of Choice with a stroll through a midsize American grocery store with its hundreds of cracker varieties scores of sunblock choices and seven varieties of Cheerios (a number that has since expanded well into double digits). Those already oppressed by the overabundance of the malls and markets now have to cope with it also in the bookstore a place one used to go knowing exactly what one wanted and what one was going to get. The Barnes & Noble website lists 173 books under the words É??The IliadÉ?ù while Amazon lists 179 (many of these are summaries or readerÉ??s guides but dozens are full translations). It was not ever thus. Classics graduate students in the 1980s (of whom I was one) debated the relative merits of Richmond Lattimore and Robert Fitzgerald the only two Iliads then in wide circulation. A new version by Robert Fagles appeared in 1990 and for most of that decade the three Rs had the field of Homer translation entirely to themselves. Then Stanley Lombardo entered the ring in 1997 with his streamlined and brashly colloquial style in an edition that shocked the academic world by putting on its cover a photo from the D-Day invasion. Since then the graph of new Iliad translations has followed a parabolic curve. Trends in publishing have led to greater diversity of many Greek and Roman texts but none have multiplied quite so fast as The Iliad in part because none are so widely assigned by college teachers. As the ClassicsÉ?? share of the curriculum has shrunk Homer has remained the blue-chip stock that belongs in every portfolio the one ancient author that the entire college communityÉ??including students who increasingly challenge faculty on the makeup of their reading listsÉ??can agree is worth reading. So The Iliad and to a lesser extent The Odyssey can be counted on to produce a steady stream of revenue for publishers every time fall and spring term book orders come due. (It was reported in The Wall Street Journal that Caroline AlexanderÉ??s version despite being the É??new kid on the blockÉ?ù would have an initial print run of 30000 and that Robert FaglesÉ?? 1990 version has by now sold more than a million.) The profit motive may explain the spate of new translations but the proliferation of translators is more puzzling. Given that a responsible Hellenist needs years of labor to render more than 15000 lines of Greek verse into passably accurate euphonious English and can expect very little in the way of either financial reward or (in the ranks of academia at least) professional advancement whence comes this great throng of men and now one woman who follow in HomerÉ??s trail like enchanted children following the Pied Piper? Caroline Alexander is an interesting case in point. A Rhodes scholar and Classicist turned journalist and nonfiction writer in the 1990s with articles in The New Yorker and a best-selling book on ShackletonÉ??s Antarctic expedition she seemed to have cast her lot with prose not poetry and to have left the ancient Greeks behind. Then in 2009 came The War That Killed Achilles her exploration for a wide readership of the meaning of The Iliad. Alexander took Homeric quotes from the Richmond Lattimore version of 1951 but also included her own version of a single chapter of the poemÉ??É??NotÉ?? because it was felt that LattimoreÉ??s work could be improved uponÉ?ù she wrote É??but becauseÉ?? it seemed an impertinence to lift an entire chapter of another scholarÉ??s work.É?ù That taste of translation seems to have changed her mind as to whether Lattimore could be bettered for she devoted much of the next five years to doing just that. Even more curious is the case of Peter Green the Greek historian who came out with a version of The Iliad this year at the age of 91. Green got his first taste of translating Homer in the early 1950s as part of a team assembled by the BBC to produce a radio version of The IliadÉ??a team that also included Christopher Logue. But he thereafter devoted his energies to more scholarly enterprises producing widely admired studies of Alexander the Great and the Hellenistic age. Translations of works by Ovid and Catullus showed he also had an ear for poetry but nothing could have predicted that following his retirement from teaching he would devote the last stage of an illustrious career to Englishing Homer. É??From time to timeÉ??not least when I saw another version of The Iliad or The Odyssey collecting tribute in the headlinesÉ??a sad twinge of regretÉ?? would nag at meÉ?ù Green writes in his preface. É??But it was only a year ago when I realized that on my next birthday I was going to 90 that I asked myself what I had to lose even now by tackling The Iliad.É?ù ItÉ??s a rare sort of person who puts É??translate The IliadÉ?? on his bucket list but Green reports that he has found great satisfaction in meeting this challenge and that he has now embarked on The Odyssey a task that will surely take him into his mid- if not late nineties. Then thereÉ??s Barry Powell an emeritus professor at the University of Wisconsin who built his reputation on academic studies like Homer and the Origin of the Greek Alphabet. After an editor at Oxford University approached Powell about translating Homer instead of analyzing him the hook was set. É??When I told my friends about this project they said É??But hasnÉ??t Homer already been translated many times?É?? Yes sure I tried to explain but not by meÉ?ù says Powell in the preface to his 2014 Iliad. One suspects that this Macbeth-like story lineÉ??in which an acquisitions editor plants the seed of ambition in the mind of a prominent scholar offering a new and undreamed-of futureÉ??has played out many times among the ranks of recent translators. The generations of men are like leaves on a tree Homer wrote in Iliad Book 6 and new versions of his poem have occupied many leaves and have required the felling of countless trees. The diversity of styles and voices in the new publishing landscape is in many ways a good thing since readersÉ??at least those willing to do an hour or two of researchÉ??can find an Iliad that closely suits their tastes. But there are inevitable downsides to a world in which nearly anyone whatever their poetic talent can fulfill a lifelong dream by getting their version of The Iliad into print. It might seem hyperbolic to say É?ùEven my neighbor is doing oneÉ?ù but in my case itÉ??s literally true since poet Charles Stein author of an already-published Odyssey now well into a translation of HomerÉ??s other epic lives just down my street. Before committing to any new Iliad however readers are well advised to consult Daniel MendelsohnÉ??s 2011 New Yorker squib comparing recent versions and deciding that Alexander PopeÉ??s just now reaching its 300th anniversary is É??at once the grandest and most minutely detailed there is ever likely to be.É?ù So much for progress. ,4752
9544394,2016-01-01T05:01:00+00:00,How Oprah Created a Profitable Weight-Loss Plan,Forget portion control: weight loss is a powerful emotional journey of self-reinvention and slow-motion clips of Oprah Winfrey billionaire media mogul and new Weight Watchers spokesperson gasping for breath on an elliptical. ThatÉ??s the message packed into a minute-long video unveiling Winfrey as the face of the diet franchise which predictably has moved Twitter users to tears. É??Inside every overweight woman is a woman she knows she can beÉ?ù Oprah tells viewers sitting in a wicker chair against a vaguely woodsy backdrop. É??Many times you look in the mirror and you donÉ??t even recognize your own self because you get lost buried in the weight that you carryÉ?ù she saysÉ??a jumble of mixed metaphors and clich??s that somehow sound like a magical incantation when delivered by Oprah. She concludes somewhat unintelligibly with a reference to her longtime battle with her weight: É??Nothing youÉ??ve ever been through is wasted. So every time I tried and failed every time I tried again and every time I tried again has brought me to this powerful moment to say É??If not now when?É??É?ù The video debuted on Christmas Eve and was tweeted by Oprah on Tuesday morning ahead of the New YearÉ??a last-minute pitch to sign up for the weight loss regime. É??Come join meÉ?ù she wrote. É??LetÉ??s do this together.É?ù Oprah herself invested $43.2 million in the 59-year-old company back in October around the time she appeared on Ellen DeGeneresÉ?? chat show and said sheÉ??d lost 15 pounds since she started Weight Watchers in August. But she didnÉ??t divulge her recent purchase: a 10 percent stake in the company. (Wall Street followed suit betting on the É??Oprah EffectÉ?ù and boosting Weight WatchersÉ?? stock which jumped again following the release of the video.) Oprah did gush to DeGeneres about Weight WatchersÉ?? revamping its program É??to bring a healthier more holistic approach for everybody.É?ù Indeed the Weight Watchers website looks more like Gwyneth PaltrowÉ??s Goop than a traditional diet site tempting visitors to É??unlock your inner awesomeÉ?ùÉ??more nonsense wordsÉ??by signing up for the new Beyond the Scale program É??our most personalized program ever.É?ù Weight Watchers has been moving towards the whole foods trend as far back as 2012 when they revealed Jessica Simpson as brand ambassador. É??IÉ??m just Jessica trying to eat real food in the real world and I really just want to be healthy for my daughterÉ?ù she said in her debut commercial with the company. Meanwhile Jennifer Hudson a celebrity spokesperson for the company from 2010 to 2014 belted out É??believe in yourself!É?ù in promotional videos that edged closer to the holistic self-help image WeightWatchers has now fully embraced with Oprah. That Oprah has invested a chunk of her fortune makes their new partnership look even more convincing. É??Because it worksÉ?ù has always been the companyÉ??s slogan but unlike previous Weight Watchers spokespeople Oprah hasÉ??very literallyÉ??put her money where her mouth is. ,26549
9544395,2016-01-01T05:01:00+00:00,The World Falls For DianaÉ??s Nieces,They are young blonde and beautiful. They hail from the most aristocratic of British bloodlines but are also willing to share saucy snaps of their carefree gilded lives on instagram. So it is perhaps little surprise that the world is going gaga for the Spencer sistersÉ??who just happen to be Princess DianaÉ??s nieces. Lady Kitty Spencer 25 and her sisters Lady Eliza and Lady Amelia have long been considered among the most fascinating young women in English society. Even though they grew up in South AfricaÉ??where their father Earl Spencer DianaÉ??s sister who at her funeral eulogized her as the most É??huntedÉ?? woman of her generation fled with his family to avoid the pressÉ?? there has always been a steady drumbeat of interest in these young beauties in aristocratic British circles. That interest was especially heightened after they emerged back into the broader public consciousness at the 2011 Royal wedding of Will and Kate where the three platinum-tressed beauties seated demurely in one of the prime seats came close to stealing the show. Kitty now lives in London but her younger twin sisters still call South Africa home. The fact that they are the nieces of Princess Diana has proved a convenient hook for a new generation of millennial style-watchers who have recently been discovered the sisters and been busily reposting their own and their friendsÉ?? photographs of their gilded lives and sometimes wild antics across social media. Hundreds of pictures across various social media platforms show the girls sunning themselves on the beach partying with friends and striking risqu?? poses for the amusement of their pals. It is certainly a far cry from the austere upbringing in large stately homes imposed on Earl Spencer and his sister Diana after their mother Frances Shand Kydd abandoned the family when he was three and Diana six. The children were placed in the custody of their father and cared for by a succession of nannies. In the UK however the Spencer girlsÉ??a beguiling mixture of aristocrat and beach babeÉ??are much much more than just an Instagram talking point. They are rather like the Herveys or the Percys the latest iteration of an ancient and powerful family with a taste for scandal and misbehavior whose fortune and destiny have been intimately entwined with those of the British state itself since the reign of Charles I. The Spencers are basically the Starks of George R.R MartinÉ??s imagination made flesh. And Charles Earl Spencer definitely has something of the Game of Thrones lifestyle about him aged 50 he has succeeded in having seven children by three different wives. The Lady Spencers as Kitty Eliza and Amelia are collectively known are the product of CharlesÉ??s 1989 marriage to the stunning model Victoria Lockwood. There is also a son Louis 21. Charles and Victoria had only known each other for a few months when they wed and Prince Harry was a pageboy at the nuptials. It was a glamorous start to a marriage that swiftly turned bad. Victoria was soon being treated for drug addiction and after she got clean they decamped to South Africa in search of a new life. Asked about her familyÉ??s decision to move to South Africa in the mid-1990s Kitty told Tatler recently?ˇÉ??We went for my birthday for a holiday and we ended up sort of staying. We just all really suited that lifestyle and my parents wanted the opportunity for a really healthy childhood for us.É?ù The truth may be more complicated than that there is no doubt Charles and Victoria hoped a new location might reboot their marriage. It didnÉ??t work. In 1997 the couple divorced. She accused him of sleeping with dozens of women many while she was in rehab while he commented when reminded of his duty to stick by his wife through thick and thin that she was É??thin and certainly thick.É?ù SpencerÉ??s daughters clearly share their parentsÉ?? wild streak. Whether intentionally or not they have developed an art for titillation in their social media personas. A recent shot of Lady Amelia puckering up with her pal Lexi Ryman en route to a South African garden party was par for the course. Another picture on RymanÉ??s account (SpencerÉ??s is private) shows the two pals cuddling up together on a garden lawn in Stellenbosch South AfricaÉ??s moneyed wine-growing region bare bronzed legs carelessly entwined. Amelia and Eliza (who are twins) are known in South Africa for their high-spirited antics but the eldest Lady Kitty who now lives in the UK recently told Tatler É??My mother has been a counsellor for 15 years and she has really educated us all about addiction and self-worth. WeÉ??ve never really wanted to rebel because sheÉ??s always been so upfront and honest. We can tell her anything. And as a result IÉ??ve never even touched a cigarette.É?ù The Spencer estates centered on the ancestral home of Althorp where Diana is buried on an island to keep ghouls away cover tens of thousands of acres of prime farmland across Northern England but it has long been made clear that the empire will be going to SpencerÉ??s son Viscount Louis 21. While the girls will not be pennilessÉ??É??I will tell you I am looking after all my children when Louis gets thisÉ?ù Spencer once saidÉ??anyone marrying a Spencer girl without a vast private fortune of their own would need their head examined.?ˇ They enjoy a millionaire lifestyle are close friends with Prince HarryÉ??s set and hop around the world jetting from Greek Islands to the South of France to Bondi Beach with carefree abandon. Lady Kitty now lives full time in the UK and is an ambassador for Give us time a charity that matches soldiers in need of a family holiday with timeshares and holiday homes owned by British families but does not have anything as tedious as a full time job. She appears to informally promote several brands on her social media pages. Her sisters are finishing university degrees in South Africa. But the tiresome question of what the Spencer girls intend to do with all their wealth and fame for now remains unanswered. ,73902
9544396,2016-01-01T05:01:00+00:00,Why Democrats Are Ready for Lincoln,A Just and Generous Nation has appeared just in time. Just in time for the 2016 presidential campaignsÉ??and for the Democrats to learn a thing or two about American history. When Sen. Bernie Sanders spoke at Georgetown University to explain what he means when he says he is a É??democratic socialistÉ?ù in November he may have waited too long do so. Given Hillary ClintonÉ??s lead in the polls her endorsements and the vast amount of money she has raised it may now be all but impossible for Sanders to prevail. And yet he must stay in the race for the nominationÉ??not only to pull Clinton to the left but also to continue to cultivate AmericansÉ?? progressive historical memory. For if Americans are to confront the crises we face and redeem the nation from 40 years of class war from aboveÉ??a class war that has devastated AmericaÉ??s industries and public infrastructures created plutocratic inequalities of wealth and power and empowered corporate executives and conservative politicians to lay siege to the hard-won rights of workers women and blacksÉ??then we need to remember what truly has made America great if not dare I say it exceptional. It may not be true that we É??have it in our power to begin the world over againÉ?ù as Thomas Paine fervently told his fellow citizens-to-be in his revolutionary pamphlet Common Sense. But as the crises struggles and events of the 1770s 1860s and 1930s and 1940sÉ??not to mention the 1960sÉ??powerfully attest when we have gotten it in our heads to rise up and harness the powers of democratic government to secure AmericaÉ??s purpose and promise we not only have succeeded in defending the United States against powerful enemies but also in making it both stronger and more prosperous and freer more equal and more democratic in the process. Not too surprisingly the 2016 GOP candidates have been doing everything they can to ignore or suppress the memory of that history. Ever since Ronald Reagan ran for the presidency in 1976 and far more successfully in 1980 Republicans have done their damnedest to not simply hijack history but also to bury it. Evidently enamored of the Gilded Age and the prospect of returning us to it conservatives have either repeatedly lied about the progressive and social-democratic achievements of 20th-century America or as we have witnessed at the debates spoken as if all of it had never happened. Of course prior to BernieÉ??s Georgetown speech recalling FDRÉ??s New Deal initiatives and vision of an Economic Bill of Rights LBJÉ??s Great Society and War on Poverty and Martin Luther KingÉ??s commitment to democratic socialism the Democrats had done little to historically challenge the Republicans. Yes Hillary launched her campaign at the FDR Four Freedoms Park in New York City. And yes Bernie cutely remarked at the Democratic debate in Des Moines Iowa that he is less of a socialist than was Republican President Dwight Eisenhower because he would not seek to raise taxes on the rich to the level that had prevailed during IkeÉ??s administration in the 1950s. However Clinton Martin OÉ??Malley and Sanders have made no real effort to remind Americans of how the nationÉ??s greatest generations and greatest leaders triumphed over the crises they confronted and in that light what we might endeavor to do today. If the Democrats want to do more than win the presidency and carry out as Bernie Sanders declares a É??political revolutionÉ?ù they need to start redeeming AmericaÉ??s greatest generations and those who inspired and led them. They need to lay claim to our greatest radicals and to our greatest presidents. Not just FDRÉ??but also Washington and especially Lincoln. All of those forefathers came to pursue both radical-democratic action and progressive nation-building. Roosevelt himself observed in the early 1930s that it was time for the Democrats to lay claim to not just the Democratic-Republican Thomas Jefferson (whom he liberated from Southern control) but also the Republican Abraham Lincoln (whom he was convinced the GOP had abandoned long ago). And FDR definitely had in mind not just Lincoln the Emancipator but also Lincoln the Nation Builder. In fact the 32nd president regularly quoted the 16th president to explain his own view of the role of government: É??The legitimate object of government is to do for a community of people whatever they need to have done but cannot do at all or cannot do as well for themselves in their separate and individual capacities.É?ù Long before Orwell wrote 1984 FDR knew the struggle for the present and future begins as a struggle for the past. His best Fireside Chats and speeches were essentially history lessonsÉ??lessons in which he reminded his fellow citizens of AmericaÉ??s purpose and promise as the great experiment in freedom equality and democracy and explained to them how his New Deal initiatives embodied the nationÉ??s finest values and aspirations. Moreover he reminded Americans that what had been achieved by earlier generations came not simply by executive action from above but by way of struggles from the bottom up. If the Democrats hope to counter 40 years of Reaganesque rhetoric hyping limited government lower taxes and corporate freedom they ??need to emulate their too-long-neglected presidential champion FDR. They need to study up on U.S. history and make clear to their fellow Americans how their progressive arguments and policy proposals emanate from the best of American history and politics. With those labors in mind I heartily recommend that Hillary Martin and Bernie read Holzer and GarfinkleÉ??s new book on Lincoln and his legacy. A Just and Generous Nation is a work of two parts. In part one Holzer and Garfinkle portray Lincoln as a man who was convinced that America had been created for a purposeÉ??to make real the DeclarationÉ??s proposition that É??all men are created equalÉ?ù and its promise of É??life liberty and the pursuit of happinessÉ?ùÉ??and who came to recognize that it was his political task challenge and duty not simply to defend and secure that purpose and promise against those who would seek to deny them but alsoÉ??as the Preamble to the Constitution statesÉ??to pursue democratic initiatives to assure and advance them. They do not exactly say it but Holzer and Garfinkle present Lincoln as a pioneering progressive and a É??premature FDR liberalÉ?ù if not a proto social democrat.?ˇ (I can already hear the shrieks of conservatives.) Like most scholars Holzer and GarfinkleÉ??the former a leading Lincoln biographer the latter an accomplished economist and businessmanÉ??rightly insist that what drove LincolnÉ??s commitment to sustain the Union to fight the Civil War the bloodiest war in American history and ultimately to abolish slavery and bring an end to the É??House dividedÉ?ù was his deeply held belief in AmericaÉ??s exceptional purpose and promise. However Holzer and Garfinkle offer an essentially fresh take on all of that. Without at all slighting LincolnÉ??s determination to hold the Union together and his hatred of slavery for what it was doing to Americans both black and white they forcefully and persuasively argue that LincolnÉ??s understanding of American exceptionalismÉ??America as the É??last best hope of earthÉ?ùÉ??was that the United States was founded to be a land not just of civil equality and political democracy but also of É??economic democracy.É?ù Their Lincoln saw America as Tocqueville saw it: as the worldÉ??s first É??middle-class nation.É?ù Gross inequalitiesÉ??slavery the grossest of them allÉ??denied that vision. If Americans native-born and immigrant were to develop and sustain a middle-class society in which opportunities abounded slavery needed to be contained and in time destroyed. As Holzer and Garfinkle show by way of LincolnÉ??s own words Lincoln held that in contrast to the Old Regime lands of Europe and the rest of the world past and present the United States was founded on an idea: É??the idea that this country É??proposed to give all a chanceÉ?? and allow É??the weak to grow stronger.É??É?ù Therefore the Union had to prevail over the Confederacy to assure the survival of AmericaÉ??s world-historic purpose and promise and slavery had to be destroyed to guarantee that purpose and promise for all Americans. And again it was not just a matter of securing the nationÉ??s promise but also of advancing it. As Holzer and Garfinkle recount from his early political days as a young Whig who believed in Henry ClayÉ??s American System through his trying times as the nationÉ??s first Republican president Lincoln saw government action not as inherently and inevitably a threat to liberty and economic opportunity (Republicans ainÉ??t what they used to be!) but all the more as a potentially great democratic force that Americans might harness to foster economic growth and development create opportunities and empower working Americans to make something of themselves and the nation. LincolnÉ??s greatest and most radical act was to sign the Emancipation Proclamation. But even in the midst of the horrors of war he and the congressional Republicans applied the powers of democratic government to nation building.?ˇ Most notably in 1862 he signed into law both the Homestead Act affording low-priced 160-acre tracts of Western lands to settlers and the Morrill Act aka the Land Grant Act which granted public lands to states to set up public colleges. And no less historically important he chartered the first transcontinental railroad and signed a bill that set the precedent for the later creation of the U.S. National Park system. IsnÉ??t all of this what Lincoln himself was saying at Gettysburg in November 1863? As Holzer and Garfinkle put it: When Lincoln spoke of a É??new birth of freedomÉ?ù he was referring not just to abolishing slavery but also to that of enhancing democratic government and the chances that Americans could continue to pursue the making of a middle-class society. É??Government of the people [and] by the peopleÉ?ù had to become as well government É??for the people.É?ù In the second part of their book Holzer and Garfinkle examine LincolnÉ??s legacy the figures and forces that turned their backs on it and those who sought to redeem and advance it. They take us through the Republican-dominated but anti-Lincolnian Gilded Age the Progressive Era of Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson the New Deal and Second World War years of FDR and his re-articulation of LincolnÉ??s words and vision in the Four Freedoms the postwar presidencies of Eisenhower Kennedy and Johnson and the making of LBJÉ??s Lincoln-like Great Society initiatives the Reagan Revolution and its anti-Lincolnian insistence that É??government is the problemÉ?ù and through the Democratic and GOP presidencies of the past 40 years. These later chapters make their cases for FDR and against not only Ronald Reagan but also Jimmy Carter whose deregulation of capital and abandonment of labor paved the way for Reagan.?ˇ Though I would add that Holzer and Garfinkle are much too kind to Bill Clinton who enacted NAFTA blundered terribly on national health care andÉ??bringing about the Great RecessionÉ??brought an end to FDRÉ??s Glass-Steagall Act. The book is flawed in other ways as well. It presents a history from the top down. In Holzer and GarfinkleÉ??s narrative presidents act and we all watch and benefit or suffer the consequences. Before writing Holzer and Garfinkle should have read the works by James Oakes Ira Berlin and John Nichols that reveal how Lincoln was moved to act by radicals abolitionists and slaves and working people themselves. Still if Hillary Martin and Bernie want to redeem American democracy and save American middle-class society from the throes of plutocracy and the evils of class war from above they would do very well to read A Just and Generous Nation. ,7723
9544397,2016-01-01T05:01:00+00:00,When Florida Men Overcame Our Racists,The second decade of the 21st century has been a sobering one for many Americans especially those who have interpreted racial progress as an indication of the end of racism. For those well-versed in both the distant and recent past claims of a post-racial era smack not only of naivety but ignorance. As even a cursory glance at any online comment section is likely to reveal racism is widespread and its proponents still walk among us.?ˇ?ˇ Americans have long underestimated the nationÉ??s race problem assuming the transition from a nation that for hundreds of years sanctioned slavery and white supremacy to one that embraces full racial equality would be an easy one. In fact the transition will continue to be difficult requiring much more than the time thatÉ??s passed since the landmark legislation of the mid-20th century. Nevertheless we should not despair. For history shows that as long as there has been racism there has been resistance to the idea. Though only recently attracting scholarly attention interracialismÉ??defined briefly as companionship collaboration and cooperation across racial linesÉ??is as much a part of American history as is racial division and strife. Even when and where you would least expect to find interracial friendships and alliances they have always existed. Take Pensacola Florida during the Civil War. In terms of politics culture and geography itÉ??s a city more Deep South than South Florida resembling Mobile and Montgomery as opposed to Miami. Given this you might not expect to discover the widespread resistance to slavery and white supremacy in the far-west Florida Panhandle during the heyday of secessionism and the rise of the Confederate States of America. But there was. Though little-known today the Civil War almost started in Pensacola when the newly elected President Abraham Lincoln ordered men and supplies to reinforce?ˇFort Pickens a massive hexagonal brick citadel on the opposite side of Pensacola Bay. Lincoln wanted to provoke Confederates into firing the first shots of the war at Fort PickensÉ??because of its defensibility. That plan failed when Army leaders ignored the commander in chiefÉ??s orders and handed Pensacola and the adjacent navy yard to the Confederacy without a fight. Despite the setback Union forces managed to hold Fort Pickens for the duration of the war. As the largest federally controlled fortification in the Deep South it became a beacon of freedom attracting hundreds of fugitive slaves. It was in the words of one soldier stationed there É??the point to which the Negroes fled after the outbreak of the war from all surrounding districts as it was for some time the only point in the extreme South which was held by federal troops and where they could be safe.É?ù A look at two separate incidents involving fugitive slaves who tried to reach Fort Pickens and instead ended up facing a Confederate court-martial proves the existence of interracialism at a time and place considered entirely hostile to the practice. The first involved five enslaved laborers claimed by Jackson Morton a Florida state senator and one of the most powerful men in region. The men Peter William Robert George and Stephen claimed they were well-treated by Morton but when he threatened to move them to Alabama they stole several boats docked near MortonÉ??s plantation and began the dangerous journey down the Blackwater River toward Fort Pickens. When they were arrested by Confederate sentinels several days later the slaves took full responsibility for the escape attempt openly avowing their desire to be free nevertheless they admitted that several white men helped convince them to abscond. According to Confederate court records the Southern race traitors included Mayo a well-known grog-shop owner in a small industrial village north of Pensacola Chance a contractor who worked for Morton near MayoÉ??s shop and Garrett a lumber trader who plied the nearby waters. For more than a year each of these free white Southerners risked their lives and livelihoods by encouraging their enslaved black associates to run away proclaiming that because of LincolnÉ??s election they were as free as white men É??and that they were fools if they did not go to Pickens as it was easily done.É?ù In the second incident a bondsman from Pensacola named Ebenezer made his way to Fort Pickens carrying newspapers and other materials considered É??useful to the United States troops stationed there and injurious to the Southern Confederacy.É?ù After being apprehended and taken aboard a Confederate steamship the É??intelligent beingÉ?ù likewise admitted to having several white accomplices. Lockly a mysterious man with a reputation for befriending his black neighbors provided the boat on which Ebenezer tried to escape and even sailed with him part of the way to Fort Pickens before being É??knocked overboard by the boom.É?ù Melmore was also notorious in Pensacola as he was É??the habitual associate of NegroesÉ??and places himself upon equality with them.É?ù When Ebenezer began plotting his escape to Fort Pickens he asked the É??IrishmanÉ?ù if there was truth to EbenezerÉ??s ownerÉ??s claim that the É??YankeesÉ?ù at Fort Pickens treated fugitive slaves severely. Melmore told Ebenezer that everything his owner told him É??was a damned lieÉ??that if he went over to the Yankees he would be so well treated that they would give him work and pay for it and Send him to New York or Liberia.É?ù In the end the Confederate court-martial found each of the runaways guilty on all charges. But before officials could carry out the punishments which ranged from hundreds of lashes to death by hanging Confederate troops evacuated Pensacola returning the city and surrounding areas to the Union. With the exception of Garrett whom the court acquitted of unknown charges the fate of É??the traitorous people with white skinsÉ?ù who encouraged and assisted these and countless other runaways to Fort Pickens is unknown. Still before leaving Pensacola a high-ranking Confederate commander warned É??those Monsters and vile wretches in the shape of white menÉ?ù of the dangers they faced should they ever betray their race again. Further evidence of interracialism surviving in the Antebellum and Confederate South comes from the last two years of the war when Union-occupied Pensacola served as a base for thousands of black and white soldiers and refugees. Among them were James Summerford and Wade Richardson two young white abolitionists who traveled from central Alabama to enlist in the Union Army. According to a memoir written years after the war Summerford came from a family of É??strong abolitionistsÉ?ù while Richardson was the son of a Universalist preacher who É??extended his creed to include all men black and white good and bad in his scheme of universal redemption.É?ù RichardsonÉ??s uncle also an abolitionist nearly lost his life to an angry mob near Tuskegee Alabama following LincolnÉ??s election when he refused to enlist in a Confederate regiment because of his opposition to slavery and secession. Summerford and Richardson nearly failed to reach Pensacola as the entire region was controlled by Confederates yet they managed to avoid detection with the assistance of black slaves who readily volunteered information on the movement of Confederate troops along É??with a bit of bread or a roasted potato or ear of corn.É?ù When the two finally reached their destination both fell victim to yellow fever. Summerford succumbed to the disease within days but Richardson managed to survive thanks to the selflessness of a É??colored nurse.É?ù É??The womanÉ??s treatment was heroic I assure youÉ?ù Richardson recalled É??but thanks to her I survived.É?ù After recovering Richardson enlisted in the First Florida Cavalry a Union regiment consisting almost entirely of white Southerners who spent much of the remainder of the war freeing hundreds of slaves along the Gulf Coast. Civil War Pensacola reminds us that history is an important teacher. While large numbers of American citizens have found white supremacy an attractive ideology worth fighting and even killing for it is just as important to remember that the dream of racial equality has also always attracted a wide followingÉ??even when and where believing such an idea came at great cost. As we continue to move forward amid the jarring sounds and arresting images of racial discord it would be wise to remember our past and have faith in our future anticipating the day when our nation will again be touched as Lincoln promised É??by the better angels of our nature.É?ù ,8442
9544398,2016-01-01T05:01:00+00:00,When MomÉ??s A Drama Queen: Anne EnrightÉ??s É??The Green RoadÉ??,Every family is in its own way a mini theater troupe each member reciting well-rehearsed lines for an audience of just each other. In Anne EnrightÉ??s family drama The Green Road matriarch Rosaleen is both star of the show and director expertly stage-managing her childrenÉ??s emotions. The novel begins in 1980 with Hanna the youngest through whose eyes we see the momentous day that her brother Dan announces heÉ??s joining the priesthood and Rosaleen takes to her bed in protest. The Madigan siblings instinctively play their assigned roles: É??Dan pulled a wry face as he went back to his book Constance might make tea and Emmett would do something very noble and pureÉ??a single flower brought from the garden a serious kiss. Hanna would not know what to do except go in and be loved.É?ù Rosaleen is the only Madigan free to choose her actions the children too young for any autonomy or power follow a script written before they were born. But then Hanna goes to visit Dan in Dublin where she sees an actual play in a real theater. She returns home and describes it to Rosaleen É??and her mother had the teatowel for a headscarf and she was hobbling along saying: É??O to have a little house! To own the hearth and stool and allÉ??!É?ù We see RosaleenÉ??s passion for not just self-conjured domestic drama but the real thing not just her small triumphs over her children but the larger losses of her life. In the next moment she realizes the tea towel is filthy and Hanna wanders off and when she comes back looking for a snack É??the only thing cooking was dirty dish-rags. Hanna lifted the lid and looked at the grey water with its scum of soap. Her mother was sitting at the table looking straight ahead.É?ù The successive chapters follow the other three Madigan children: in 1991 Dan having failed to become a priest++ is in New York attempting to succeed at remaining heterosexual. His family is a tug across the ocean: É??Just over there see? Three thousand miles thattaway thatÉ??s where I am from.É?ù Six years later Constance back home in Ireland awaits a mammogram rich on IrelandÉ??s economic boom taken for granted by her children her husband and her mother. In 2002 Emmett is in Mali continuing to attempt an act noble and pureÉ??of the Madigan boys he might have been the one best suited for the priesthoodÉ??but instead punishing himself any time he comes close to love. Which brings us back to Ireland where in 2005 Rosaleen is writing her Christmas cards with a practiced application of guilt and withholding of affection as she decides as a literal postscript to sell the family home in a calculated bid to get her children back under one roof. RosaleenÉ??s plot succeeds and soon her children are back at their assigned places at the table instantly regressed to their childhood selves: Dan still the favorite Constance the servant Emmett the unloved Hanna the fuckup but this time less enthusiastic to play their parts. They do so begrudgingly grasping at reminders of who they are in their É??realÉ?? lives. É??OMG SOSÉ?ù Dan texts his boyfriend back in Toronto. Hanna sneaks bottles of wine. Constance spends a small fortune on groceries gets her hair done É??in a place so posh it didnÉ??t look done at all.É?ù Emmet sulks: É??It was Emmet thought like living in a hole in the ground.É?ù As with the opening of the book Rosaleen turns a non-crisis into a starring role for herself in the family drama wielding her only real power which is the power of her absence. In searching for their missing mother the siblings are briefly unified. They donÉ??t so much transcend their individual roles as triumph in them each playing the part he or she was born to play in the drama of saving their motherÉ??s life: É??We had been for those hours on the dark mountainside a force. A family.É?ù And Rosaleen finally getting the attention she craves the audience she deserves brings down the house: É??Emmet saw what he had not seen in many years: his mother being wonderfulÉ??It was just her mood that changed. It was just her life that had changed.É?ù The term É??domestic novelÉ?ù comes up often when critics talk about contemporary women writers though what domestic means and what the alternative is is rarely specified. Like EnrightÉ??s previous novels The Green Road with its pages-long description of the contents of a grocery cart its minute attentions to the business of feeding and clothing a body and inhabiting a house could certainly be called domestic. Yet the novel spans continents not just in terms of EnrightÉ??s charactersÉ?? wanderings but in the breadth of her concerns. The opposite of a domestic novel might be called a global novel and in these brilliantly realized shiningly human characters who so convincingly enact the human drama of family Enright has written a book that is not just global but universal. ,4870
9544390,2016-01-01T05:02:00+00:00,Gay Open Marriages Need To Come Out of the Closet,The year 2015 was a landmark one for same-sex couples in AmericaÉ??the Supreme Court made marriage equality the law of the land and even before the decision some 390000 gay couples had already gotten hitched in states like Massachusetts and New York. The Washington Post projected that number would increase nationwide to 500000 by the end of the year. What makes these newly-married couples unique is more than their gender. Surveys indicate that a high percentage of same-sex relationshipsÉ??particularly among queer menÉ??are non-monogamous and often even after marriage. Over the past decade and a half studies from San Francisco State University and Alliant International University have found that around half of gay relationships are open. This rate is considerably higher than for heterosexual and lesbian couples but itÉ??s difficult to say by how much exactly due to the widespread lack of substantive research on the subject. (After all SFSUÉ??s Gay Couples Study was back in 2010.) Conservative estimates suggest that less than one percent of all married couples are in an open relationship but other approximations are much higher. Back in 1983 the authors of American Couples Phillip Blumstein and Pepper Schwartz found that around 15 percent of committed partnersÉ??whether homo or heterosexualÉ??had agreements that allowed for some degree of flexibility. Writer and sex columnist Dan Savage famously described these arrangements as É??monogamishÉ?ùÉ??É??mostly monogamous not swingers not actively looking.É?ù And even more couples are in them than you think. IÉ??d say that the Alliant and SFU figures are a tad low at least for gays. I canÉ??t speak for lesbian couples but few queer men I knowÉ??including myselfÉ??are in relationships that are exclusively 100-percent monogamous. Some couples occasionally invite a third into the bedroom for a night of play while others independently arrange their own casual hook-ups. Some men might even have long-term partners outside their primary relationship. In a 2013 column for Slate Hanna Rosin called non-monogamy the gay communityÉ??s É??dirty little secretÉ?ù citing a study from the 80É??s which showed that up to 82 percent of gay couples had sex with other people. That number sounds about right to me but hereÉ??s the thing: ItÉ??s not dirty and itÉ??s hardly a secret at least if you know where to look. Monogamish couples are a constant presence on apps like Grindr and Scruff which allow gay men to connect with other men to chat or hook up. Users commonly describe themselves as É??datingÉ?ù É??in an open relationshipÉ?ù É??partneredÉ?ù or É??marriedÉ?ù while others set up an account with their partner if theyÉ??re looking to play together. I spoke to one couple that hasnÉ??t let marriage get in the way of their Scruff account. Eric 34 and Martin 33 walked down the aisle last October after dating for five years. Like many gay couples they were initially monogamous although with É??infrequent and informalÉ?ù exceptions. É??Think post-bar bathhouse outingsÉ?ù Eric explained. But after creating a profile together on Scruff a few years ago the couple agreed on a set of boundaries. É??We only sleep with people together we have to both communicate with the person to some extent before we meet up and the guy has to very clearly be attracted to both of usÉ?ù Eric said. Like nearly everyone I spoke to the pair had few gay friends that were in monogamous relationships and Martin believes itÉ??s because there are fewer rules and expectations around gay relationships. É??I think we donÉ??t have heteronormative templates that we have to subscribe toÉ?ù Martin said. É??ThereÉ??s just not that same kind of pressure to be monogamous when youÉ??re gay.É?ù Travis 29 and Ahmad 32 felt that gay non-monogamy fits an era where relationships themselves are being redefinedÉ??whether thatÉ??s through sweeping court victories or the advent of the Internet. É??On a macro level we have the opportunity as É??the new normalÉ?? to redefine what a healthy gay relationship isÉ?ù Travis argued. É??Also weÉ??re learning to navigate our sexuality in a digital age where everything is so accessible and we are just talking about it instead of cheating on the side.É?ù If non-monogamy is such a central aspect of modern gay relationships why have we stayed in the closet about itÉ??as Rosin suggested? Perhaps itÉ??s because we tend to have an overwhelmingly negative view of monogamish partnerships which are seen as a gateway drug for infidelity and fraught with jealousy and conflict. In a 2014 Reddit thread one user said that when he sees someone list themselves as in an É??open relationshipÉ?ù on Scruff he views it as code for: É??I have a boyfriend but want to cheat.É?ù The problem is that queer monogamish couples lack positive visibility. We donÉ??t have our Will and Jada the celebrity couple who models what a successful healthy open marriage can look like. When asked about reports that the couple are non-monogamous Jada Pinkett Smith told Howard Stern: É??You gotta trust who youÉ??re with and at the end of the day IÉ??m not here to be anybodyÉ??s watcher.É?ù There have long been rumors that Anderson Cooper and his husband New York nightclub owner Ben Maisani might be in an open marriage since 2012 when Maisani was allegedly spotted kissing another man in Central Park. However the pair have yet to confirm or deny. Although Dan Savage once lamented that the gay community has few successful monogamish gay couples out there telling their stories that doesnÉ??t mean these relationships are failing. In 2010 the New York TimesÉ?? Scott James reported that É??open gay relationships actually [last] longerÉ?ù than exclusive partnerships. As James writes É??some experts say that boundary-challenging gay relationships represent an evolution in marriageÉ??one that might point the way for the survival of the institution.É?ù Gays might be É??savingÉ?ù marriage but for far too long the burdens of the marriage equality movementÉ??which highlighted the universality of loveÉ??made many feel like they couldnÉ??t be honest about what makes same-sex relationships unique. In a 2013 piece for Gawker Steven Thrasher wrote É??Gay-rights groups are often nervous about sociologists or reporters looking too closely at what really happens in the bedrooms of gay relationships out of fear that anti-gay activists will bludgeon them with a charge of sexual promiscuity as a reason to deny them equal rights.É?ù Aside from the hollow threat of President Marco Rubio repealing same-sex unions gays have little to fear about the state of their marriage rights today: Love won. And after a year that saw people like Kentucky County Clerk Kim DavisÉ??who refused to sign gay couplesÉ?? marriage licensesÉ??publicly ridiculed and censured for standing in the way of equality love keeps winning. But that victory wonÉ??t feel complete until we learn to be open about the very relationships we fought so hard for. ,17115
9544389,2016-01-01T05:03:00+00:00,The Syrian Refugee Band Touring Europe,BUKAREVAC Serbia É?? On a cool September night in the Serbian border town of Bukarevac members of the Syrian post-rock band Khebez Dawle stretched out on a patch of grass next to a bus station full of refugees from the worlds worst conflicts. People clamoring for any ride that could get them closer to the European Union swarmed the busses pulling in. It was a long way from the harsh stage lights of BeirutÉ??s trendy clubs where the band was a central fixture of a burgeoning local Indy rock scene in the neighborhoods of Hamra and Mar Mikhael. It is farther still from the horrors of the Syrian civil war that the band fled in 2013 and the Damascus underground rock scene that brought them together. Waiting for the delayed midnight bus to Belgrade after crossing the Macedonian border they made a snap decision to avoid the Hungarian police crackdown on asylum seekers entering from Serbia and tried to reroute through Croatia. Lead singer Anas Maghrebi bass player Muhammad Bazz and keyboardist Hikmat Qassar were in the middle of the arduous journey that half a million Syrians have taken this year. Two months later Maghrebi admitted that as some the first asylum seekers to reach Croatia they unknowingly walked through border areas full of landmines just prior to the arrival of masses of refugees rerouted by HungaryÉ??s border closure. The band left Turkey on a volatile ride in a rubber dingy to Greece before starting a long trek through Europe that combined hiking public transport and smugglersÉ?? cars. And in the grittiest form of rock and roll tradition they turned their odyssey in search of freedom into a European tour playing shows to hundreds of new fans in Zagreb and Vienna along the way. Maghrebi likes to say he leaped from an inflatable raft to hand out free copies of the groupÉ??s just-released album to sunbathing tourists on the beach of the Greek island of Lesbos. He calls the impromptu CD release party amidst the euphoria of reaching Europe a statement to the world about SyriaÉ??s refugees. É??This trip is not about being victims the poor people. ItÉ??s about being freeÉ?ù says the lanky bearded vocalist as he lights a hand-rolled cigarette. ãØ®É??We are some of the most cultured people in the Middle East and we can bring that to people here.É?ù The bandÉ??s name is Arabic for É??bread of the nationÉ?ù a phrase that Maghrebi adapts to define collectively those fleeing to Europe in numbers not seen since the Second World War. ãØ®É??We are the khebez of the dawleÉ?ù he said there on the grass in Serbia stretching out as Radio HeadÉ??s É??OK ComputerÉ?ù album blared from portable speakers connected to his smartphone. On Khebez DawleÉ??s own recording the Arabic lyrics tell a story of the shattering of revolutionary dreams and the grueling trauma of civil war set to intense post-rock instrumental crescendos mixed with the sampled sounds of the conflict. Maghrebi calls it a witnessÉ??s account of the war. The album leads you through SyriaÉ??s spiralling descent from the optimism and hope of the revolution into anger at a regime that drowned protests in blood and finally the alienation of being lost amid a fractured sectarian civil war. Songs about self-discovery and euphoria in the streets carry a longing for the hopes of a world that has been shattered. MaghrebiÉ??s vocals plead with his country to reject rule through victimization and torment. É??TheyÉ??ve killed me! And then they blame me for tellingÉ?ù he sings in the track É??BetaÉ??ammer.É?ù É??In the darkness there is no life but for a victim and their tormentorÉ?ù his voice reverberates in Arabic over screaming guitars. Magrehbi hopes that while the lyrics confront Arabic listeners with the search for meaning in SyriaÉ??s madness the music conveys the same experience to an international audience through its sound. É??We want the music itself to be a language so you hear it and understand what we are understandingÉ?ù he says. There on the patch of grass as the guys sipped cans of beer and took turns strumming on a guitar they picked up in Athens it would be easy to mistake them for hipsters hanging out in a New York park. But here among hundreds of asylum seekers bustling around the town cloaked in the shadow of towering Tito-era socialist apartment blocks there was no question these huddles masses were a long long way from Lady Liberty. I first met Maghrebi last June at a house party in BeirutÉ??s Christian neighborhood of Geitawi. The band was preparing to release its first album but after two years in Beirut the institutional and social discrimination against Syrians had worn Maghrebi down. Leaning on the kitchen counter while activists artists and journalists swirled about he noted the contrast between the strong support that the band received from the local artistic community and the debilitating government restrictions that discriminate against Syrian refugees. Band members had difficulty finding stable income and because of restrictions on Syrians working in Lebanon earning a living from their music was unstable and under the table. Two months later their album was released to local fanfare their drummer split from the group and most of them were heading to Turkey after selling their equipment to pay for the journey. Maghrebi reflecting on his journey form Beirut from Bukarevac called it É??the hardest rehearsal for Europe.É?ù And for some it was harder than others. Guitarist Bashar Darwish couldnÉ??t leave with the rest of his band mates because his desertion from Bashar al-AssadÉ??s Syrian government forces and an escape from the country organized by a Free Syrian Army left him without a Syrian passport. It wasnÉ??t until November that he was able to leave for Istanbul after relaxed passport regulations for Syrians outside the country took effect. Darwish had met the rest of the group while he was playing in a Damascus hard rock band called Ana. These were the days before the uprising and civil war and he was studying music at the conservatory in Damascus. Playing in the underground rock scene was full of hurdles. The regime had a bureaucratic and politicized process for getting permission to play gigs not an easy task for a metal head who cites Pantera and Slipknot as his influences. É??You had to know someone who knew someone and we couldnÉ??t play the heavy stuffÉ?ù he told me on a Skype call from Istanbul in November. É??You also had to have a song about either Syria or PalestineÉ??. So we did one about PalestineÉ?ù he chuckles. A song about Syria wouldnÉ??t endear the group to the regime. But in 2010 Darwish was conscripted forced to drop out of the conservatory and serve as an army radio operator. When the mass protests of the Arab Spring reached Damascus in the spring of 2011 he says he was supportive but unable to join. É??IÉ??m angry that I couldnÉ??t participateÉ?ù he told me. Magrhebi was in the opposite position not serving in the military and a vocal supporter of the revolt. He still cites the hope of those early days of protest as inspiration for many of his lyrics. As revolution turned into a bloody multifaceted regional proxy war the band left for Lebanon. One by one they fled bloodshed dodging conscription or deserting their army posts. Bazz and Qassar fled the country in 2013 within days of getting their call-up notices. Maghrebi left around the same time. Darwish was serving in a non-combat unit so tried at first to keep his head down and sit out the war in a radio bunker. However in 2012 he got transfer orders to a combat unit and deserted. For six nerve-racking months he hid out in Damascus until the FSA was able to get him out of the city and guide him on foot through the mountains to Lebanon. Arriving in Beirut without any documents and only the clothes on his back Darwish found a new life full of harassment and restriction in a country that still doesnÉ??t officially recognize its over one million Syrians as refugees. It was in this context that Khebez Dawle was launched and carved out a place for itself in the cityÉ??s vibrant nightlife. É??At first I was happy to escape and felt free but after that I started to face problemsÉ?ù Darwish says sitting on the floor of a friendÉ??s Istanbul apartment surrounded by keyboards and mixers. É??I got arrested by the Lebanese authorities because I was illegal and didnÉ??t have papersÉ?ù he says. Then he was arrested a second time trying to leave the country on a fake Syrian passport. The pro-Assad Lebanese Shia organizations Hezbollah and Amal suspecting he was a deserter targeted him for questioning on several occasions. The rest of the band reached Berlin in October and are now navigating the immigration process while settling into a new life. They are already planning an official European tour for spring part of which will have them reverse their migration path from central Europe back to the Balkans and then onto Greece. Maghrebi contends that while they were originally planning on staying in Vienna the band was drawn to BerlinÉ??s internationalism vibrant art scene and openness to refugees. É??In Berlin I feel like a global citizen like I can express my fears and hopes and artÉ?ù he said on Skype from the German capital shortly after the Paris terrorist attacks. Despite the welcoming cosmopolitan arrival he says heÉ??s felt an increase in hostility directed at Syrians since the massacre in France even though none of the known attackers was in fact Syrian. For Maghrebi like many refugees the post-Paris-attack climate has not only created fear of a backlash alongside horror at the carnage that ISIS unleashed but it also conjured up the familiar feeling that the war cannot be escaped. É??I donÉ??t want to see a piece of whatÉ??s happened in Syria happen in EuropeÉ?ù Maghrebi said. Meanwhile Darwish remains stranded in Turkey as the rough winter waters of the Mediterranean make crossing to Greece now especially dangerous. He worries that the spiking hostility towards refugees since the attacks and new European Union agreements with Turkey to stop asylum seekers from leaving for Greece will prevent him from rejoining the band. The UN Refugee Agency reported from Lesbos this week that É??despite strong winds and choppy waves on Dec. 30 dozens of families continued to land.É?ù They were coming in É??overstuffed inflatable boats designed to carry just eight people.É?ù Some carried more than 60. Darwish has applied for a EU visa but the band has tried and been denied them in the past despite invitations to play at European festivals. He is torn between the stress of making it to Germany for the tour and waiting for a calmer spring sea. So living in limbo and distracting himself with solo projects he prepares for the likely clandestine journey of what the band hopes is the final stage of its rock and refuge tour. ,4351
9544387,2016-01-01T05:05:00+00:00,What You Missed While You Were Trumping,One of the most frustrating aspects of the Year of Trump besides everything was the viciously cyclical nature of Trump coverage. Attention and outrage are the fuel of Trumpism and attempts to explain his rise wound up re-inscribing the central falsehood of his campaign: that people are angry about an America in decline and a government with suspect motives and marginal competence. But what if none of that were true? What if people arenÉ??t really angry America isnÉ??t actually in decline and our government is neither malicious nor incompetent? Are people angry? Americans as whole say they are and IÉ??ve been through enough counseling that I hesitate to tell anyone how they feel. But Trump supporters arenÉ??t angry theyÉ??re terrified. There are forms of righteous angerÉ??the kind of communal eruption that happens when there are no other legitimate forms of expression. Trump supporters on the other hand do no lack for legitimate forms of expression. People are asking them what they think and feel all the time. There is not a second of time in the last 600 years that the world has had to guess at what American white people want. Numerous progressive commentators (and Saturday Night Live) have pointed out that the nostalgia inherent in making America great É??againÉ?ù is little more than a pull toward a time before a gaymarriageblackpresidentscarymuslims. As one analyst put it É??Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.É?ù Is America in decline no longer É??greatÉ?ù? IÉ??m tempted to indulge in a poetic interpretation to delve into the areas of American culture and society that produced greatness on a regular basisÉ??from rescue workers to scientists artists to educators. But Trump (and his supporters) are at once thuddingly literal and immeasurably ambiguous: É??GreatnessÉ?ù seems to be a combination of economic success and world-leader dick-measuring. But if the U.S. has fallen so far in world esteem how come the immigrants that so upset Trumpkins want to come here? Less concretely there are actual data about how the rest of the world views America and itÉ??s largely positiveÉ??we have an overall 65 percent approval rating with some countries giving us the kind of marks that are a distant memory for AmericaÉ??s political class: 75 percent positive opinion in France (France!) 80 percent in both El Salvador and Kenya. Economically well by the measure of the white working-class non-college-educated Trump supporters they are either extremely late to the realization that their wages have stagnated (indeed in real terms the average hourly wage peaked in 1973) orÉ??and weÉ??re happening on a theme hereÉ??the complaint isnÉ??t about the loss of É??greatnessÉ?ù so much as the emergence of a perceived threat to the status quo. I donÉ??t think itÉ??s even about America being less great for them. ItÉ??s an alarm over the possibility that America is becoming great for people who arenÉ??t them. Whether American greatness is in fact becoming more widely accessible is a separate but related questionÉ??and it brings us to the final falsity of the Trumpian theology: Government is both evil and inept. ThereÉ??s no doubt that it can be itÉ??s mostly been evil and inept in the way itÉ??s treated the very people Trumpkins worry about sharing the greatness pie with. Those communities continue to suffer but here is where the Trump theology finds purchase: In 2015 our democracyÉ??the functioning one outside the circus of the party primariesÉ??did a lot right by its citizens. Some old wrongs began to be righted: The death penalty is increasingly unpopular not just in the public eye but with state legislatures and judges. Courts in Texas (Texas!) issued two (two!) death-penalty sentences in all of 2015É??the fewest since re-instating the penalty 40 years ago. Across the country death sentences dropped 33 percent from 2014 with 49 people being sentenced to death this year. By comparison: In 1996 315 people were put on death row. Also in 2015 just six states carried 28 out executions the fewest since 1999É??when 98 people were killed. And while officer-involved shootings continue to be flashpoints for community unrest cities have grabbed on to the Department of JusticeÉ??s best practicesÉ??hard-won lessons from Ferguson Missouri being put to use in places such as my adopted hometown of Minneapolis where the biggest headline of the year might be the riot that didnÉ??t happen in the wake of the death of Jamal Clark. Also this year: Politicians embraced the end of the war on the drugs and the beginning of the movement to aid those in addiction. (A turn of events that may be the only lasting memory of Chris ChristieÉ??s presidential campaign.) Police departments are experimenting with a policy that puts treatment before arrest: In Glouchester Massachusetts addicts who ask police for treatment will be assisted into a programÉ??on the spot. More than 100 have found help so far. At the federal level almost unnoticed this month Congress ended the federal enforcement of drug laws where the state has legalized medical marijuana. Somewhere between old wrongs being righted and new paths forward: The fight to raise the minimum wage continues to catch on among activists and allies in government. In 2015 workers won higher hourly wages in 13 states and in 14 municipalities (PDF). These werenÉ??t just soft-hearted coastal governmentsÉ?? blue bleeding hearts in action either: Michigan and Nebraska went to $15 an hour as well as Missoula Montana Pittsburgh and Buffalo New York. And in more forward-looking changes the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau now in its fifth year has become the exact kind of watchdog-with-teeth Elizabeth Warren envisioned. ItÉ??s taking in a record number of consumer-generated complaints (through November: 749400 24300 in October aloneÉ??more in one month than it saw in all of 2014). AND itÉ??s stepped in on some of the longest-running but legal scams in America cracking down on (and getting huge payouts for consumers from) payday lenders and for-profit colleges. How successful is the CFPB? Its right-wing critics have resorted to fearmongering about the importance of payday loans in the fight against terrorism. This isnÉ??t to say that the year didnÉ??t also see tragedy and horror many instances emerging from governmental abuse or ineptitude but itÉ??s important to remember that the fear that Trump has based his campaign on is not real. The idea that small-d (and occasionally big-d) democratic government works undermines the entire framework of Trumpism. Programs like the CFPB and the slow turn toward true criminal justice are kryptonite to the strongman ideology of Trump not just because it fucks with his message of government incompetence or maliciousness. Its successful tenure is evidence of government for the people to be sure but its existence is also evidence of government by the people. The image of Obama as capricious dictator making social-justice decrees out of pique is TrumpkinsÉ?? favorite myth because it cuts out the part of our American story that they are the least able to explain or process: Obama and Democrats have facilitated these incremental bits of forward progress because they won. They were elected to do so. Grappling with the fact of a functional government requires more than the admission that protecting citizens is legitimate activityÉ??it also forces the argument that government protects and fights for people because thatÉ??s what its people want. The fearful coverage of the TrumpÉ??s fear-filled campaign has created an echo of terror on the left of course. Part alarmist fundraising necessity on the part of Democrats part symptom of a conflict-obsessed media many rational and sane Americans now think that there is a real possibility of Donald Trump will be elected president. I donÉ??t want to encourage complacency by denying the possibility but I do want to remind everyone: WeÉ??re better than that. WeÉ??ve shown ourselves to be better than that. DonÉ??t be afraid. Be aware. ,12562
9544385,2016-01-01T05:08:00+00:00,This Is What Should Happen In The Final Season of É??Downton AbbeyÉ??,So have you managed it? Have you done the reading equivalent of putting your hands over your ears and shouting É??lalalaÉ?ù as someone tries to impart vital information to you? Have you in short defied every intruding tentacle of modern media to ensure you can watch the final season of Downton Abbey in American time rather than British? If so congratulations and I assume you have the cucumber sandwiches pots of tea and dense fruitcake in hand for Sunday nightÉ??s premiere. (TheDaily BeastÉ??s reviews will run after each episode.) Downton Abbey finally finished its life in the UK on Christmas Day and it did so with a flood of articles and reviews none of which will be linked to here. Because lalala. One headline gave something huge away to this reader whose eyes alighted upon the headline before realizing what the headline was. In that split second there was both horror and a determined self-imposed amnesia on what had been seen. Five days later I am again none the wiser. I know nothing. I must know nothing. Do not tell me anything. Lalala. So what do we want for this merry band of poshos their servants and that honey-colored house of intrigue? We left them at the end of season five in various states of romantic and personal chaos. I think itÉ??s not too much of a leap to suggest there is a consensus that Mrs. Hughes and Mr. Carson should indeed proceed happily to the altar. However this is Downton Abbey and as Mrs. Hughes for some reason had a huge where-the-hell-did-that-come-from? speech at the end of season five about having to take care of psychotic relatives perhaps their journey to marital bliss will not come without a bug-eyed sister appearing out of a shadows with a rolling pin. Unless series creator and writer Julian Fellowes has had another idea for them bets must also be placed on who out of Mr. or Mrs. Bates will spend the duration of season six wrongly accused of murder and in jail. Currently itÉ??s Mrs. Bates facing the slammer but this is only until Mr. Bates finds someone evil associated with the case and doesnÉ??t kill them but looks like he does and then he is wrongly accused of it and then ends upÉ?? Unless. Unless. Unless Julian Fellowes can think of something new to put Mr. and Mrs. Bates through which doesnÉ??t involve a wrongful murder accusation. I know. Radical suggestion. Just saying. Similarly: Edith. The ugly duckling child has basically been FellowesÉ?? punching bag since the storyÉ??s start. First it was her plainness and dourness that was bitchily targeted by her glamorous man-magnet older sis. Then Fellowes put Edith through a succession of hurtful humiliating romantic disasters. Then she gave birth to a baby that shame dictated she give away but have near. Then that baby was introduced to her home as an orphan which she would take care of. In season six Edith and Mary will surely both be shown pursuing career-oriented pathsÉ??both very different and both probably derailed by romantic intrigues. How long can Edith or Poor Edith as her many fans know and love her go through this cycle of relentless degradation and having emotional excrement thrown at her? We may want Edith to have a happy endingÉ??I want it more powerfully than I want Mary to have one or Cora to have a full-blooded storyline of her ownÉ??but you sense Fellowes is going to put her through yet more ludicrous wringers to get there. As for Lady Mary she had a bottleneck of posh suitors by the end of last season: handsome chaps with chiseled jaws but all truly dreary and dull. The problem with Mary is that she can never outdo her initial love story with Matthew and the death of Mr. Pamuk. But more men come for her armed with defrosting guns in season six. I want to know nothing else. Lalala. It seems kind of ridiculous that they donÉ??t put her together with Branson her dead sisterÉ??s surviving husband. It is ruining nothing to reveal he is coming back for season six. A good ending must surely be in line for Barrow whom we last saw scheming for good against Lord Sinderby in season five. The formerly total evil closeted gay footman has been softened of lateÉ??and after a dispiriting flirtation with reparative therapy may be set to hold his nascent rainbow flag a little more proudly. Lord Grantham and Cora can only be rocked by something totally unpredictableÉ??even regular viewers have tired of how many times Downton itself can be in perilÉ??although season six will surely open up a new avenue of this perennial favorite. Ever since she slipped on the soap and lost her baby Cora has been storyline-freeÉ??apart from batting her doe eyes in a perfect-hostess wayÉ??until last seasonÉ??s set of brief and ultimately chaste assignations with that art critic played by Richard E. Grant. As for Baxter and Molesley: get them together extend their Hart to Hart-style?ˇdetective work into a fully fledged agency. This leaves posh cuz Rose whom I donÉ??t yet really care about (nice as she is) Mrs. Patmore under siege from more kitchen technology the Countess Dowager (the fierce incomparable Dame Maggie Smith) last seen dispatching a lovelorn Russian aristo back into the arms of his estranged wife and kitchen maid Daisy who wants something better but keeps coming back to scraping potatoes. The barest of things we do know or may care to know going into season six: it is 1925 the estateÉ??yesÉ??is going through yet more change as in a mirror to modern recessionary timesÉ??the high costs of running Downton mean servants may be in the firing line. Texts from friends in LondonÉ??shut up lalalaÉ??suggest that happy endings are in order. But the soft driving winds around Downton have always been about É??changeÉ?? and its imminence and its inevitability. Even when episodes are bad and storylines drift incomprehensibly for months at a timeÉ??as with the BatesÉ??s and their wrongful imprisonmentsÉ??there is still the charm of a soup competition or the parrying banter between the Countess Dowager and Isobel CrawleyÉ??a favorite of this viewers played beautifully by Penelope Wilton. The perfection is in the mix and even when that mix is not perfect there is something in the way Fellowes crafts Downton that keeps fans satiated. The final season of any show however is the hardestÉ??saying goodbye giving the characters the endings that both they deserve and the viewers deserve. For that FellowesÉ??s autocratic stewardship of the show augurs wellÉ??if anyone knows this eclectic maddening loveable group of servers and the served and the both tender and tense yoking that binds them it is Fellowes. Whatever elseÉ??no spoiler thisÉ??he will do right by them. ,20929
9544383,2016-01-01T05:10:00+00:00,É??SherlockÉ?? Sends Benedict Cumberbatch Back in Time to Victorian London,They finally got Benedict CumberbatchÉ??s Sherlock Holmes to put on that iconic deerstalker cap. In an episode from the second series of MasterpieceÉ??s contemporary-set Sherlock the title character impulsively uses the hat most associated with the literary detective to hide his face from the paparazzi. It inadvertently becomes his signature when the photo lands on the front cover of BritainÉ??s tabloids. É??What kind of hat is it anyway?É?ù a frustrated Sherlock wonders. É??Is it a cap? WhyÉ??s it got two fronts?É?ù When Martin FreemanÉ??s Watson informs him that itÉ??s called a É??deerstalkerÉ?ù he adds É??You canÉ??t stalk a deer with that. What are you going to do throw it? Some sort of death frisbee?É?ù He promptly chucks the hat across the room with no intention of ever putting it back on his head. Yet there Cumberbatch is wearing the maligned hat along with more Arthur Conan Doyle-era Victorian period dress in the new Sherlock special É??The Abominable BrideÉ?ù set to premiere simultaneously for the first time in Britain and the U.S. on January 1. There are horse-drawn carriages in the streets of London and a curlicue mustache on John WatsonÉ??s face. ThereÉ??s even an over-sized pipe in HolmesÉ??s mouth. What happened to the modern-day Sherlock viewers have grown to love over the past five years? When period-tinged photos started to leak from the set earlier this year SherlockÉ??s co-creator Steven Moffat was quick to clarify that the change was made for this one-off special only and not a permanent shift in the series. É??The special is its own thingÉ?ù Moffat told Entertainment Weekly in March. É??We wouldnÉ??t have done the story weÉ??re doing and the way weÉ??re doing it if we didnÉ??t have this special. ItÉ??s not part of the run of three episodes. So we had this to do itÉ??as we could hardly concealÉ??itÉ??s Victorian.É?ù He added É??ItÉ??s kind of in its own little bubble.É?ù As for the nature of that story itÉ??s a bit more supernatural than a typical episode of the show which tends to rely on the detectiveÉ??s on-the-spectrum attention to detail along with modern technological advances to solve its convoluted cases. This time weÉ??re dealing with a É??ghost story.É?ù É??Ghost stories work better in a Victorian settingÉ?ù Moffat said recently. É??This strand of Doyle original stories that are creepy and scary and the chillers we havenÉ??t done much with in the modern show. But putting it back into Victorian times you think itÉ??s a chance to do a ghost story reallyÉ??a creepy scary one.É?ù According to MoffatÉ??s co-creator Mark Gatiss who also plays Mycroft Holmes in the series the specialÉ??s title is derived from an off-hand reference Sherlock makes to the case of É??Ricoletti of the club foot and his abominable wifeÉ?ù in DoyleÉ??s short story The Musgrave Ritual. But beyond that small clue the showrunners revealed little else about the plot. Actor Rupert Graves who plays Inspector Lestrade and sports enormous muttonchops as the period version of his character remarked in a behind-the-scenes featurette for the special how everything in the Sherlock world slows down without the benefit of modern technology. É??One of the great things about the modern day Sherlock is the speed with which he can globally get things doneÉ?ù Graves said. É??In this you have to use telegrams and morse and I think that has an atmospheric shift.É?ù Cumberbatch added that the time period transformation did not change much about his character whom he describes as É??very old-fashionedÉ?ù even in a modern setting. É??HeÉ??s very contained in another eraÉ?ù he said. É??So for me it feels weirdly at home for this character.É?ù But the decision to air a one-off special as opposed to kicking off the highly-anticipated fourth series this year likely has more to do with CumberbatchÉ??s demanding schedule than any grand artistic statement. Not only did the actor star in a divisive version of Hamlet this past year but he also had a starring role in Black Mass stirred controversy with his trans character in the upcoming Zoolander 2 and started filming the title role in MarvelÉ??s Doctor Strange. Meanwhile Martin Freeman has been nearly as busy wrapping up the Hobbit series and his role in Fargo while filming next yearÉ??s Whisky Tango Foxtrot alongside Tina Fey and making an appearance in yet another Marvel property Captain America: Civil War. There simply wasnÉ??t time to shoot more than one episode of Sherlock which is certain to disappoint some fans who are anxiously awaiting the resolution of a major cliffhanger from the end of series three. When we last left Holmes he had been banished to Eastern Europe to embark on a mysterious mission after murdering É??the Napoleon of blackmail.É?ù But he is immediately called back to London when it is discovered that his nemesis Moriarty is still alive. Rather than address any of those lingering questions The Abominable Bride transports the characters into the past where they must take on an entirely new case. But it appears that the salty nature of Watson and HolmesÉ?? relationship remains intact. É??YouÉ??re Sherlock Holmes wear the damn hatÉ?ù Watson says at one point shoving the deerstalker into his partnerÉ??s hands. ,34501
9544380,2016-01-01T05:15:00+00:00,This Mad Scientist Will Clone 100000 Cows,Two decades after the birth of Dolly the sheepÉ??the worldÉ??s first successfully cloned mammalÉ??the year 2016 will likely see the rise of mass-produced animal clones thanks to an enterprising and madcap scientist in China. Sometime in the next year a company called Boyalife Genomics will open a massive factory in the coastal Chinese city of Tianjin where it plans to clone 100000 cattle per yearÉ??a way to address the Middle KingdomÉ??s rising appetite for beef. Eventually the company aims to clone 1 million cattle a year as well as other animals like champion racehorses and drug-sniffing dogs. Cloned humansÉ??or as BoyalifeÉ??s founder Xiao-Chun Xu calls them É??FrankensteinsÉ?ùÉ??are not on the menu. Not yet. XuÉ??s ultramodern factoryÉ??its layout is bigger than three football fieldsÉ??is the latest manifestation of the sci-fi cloning craze thatÉ??s seen members of a Florida nonprofit try to clone a 2000-year-old tree and a South Korean company clone two puppies in an attempt to reincarnate a British coupleÉ??s beloved dead dog. Of course scraping bark from a tree or sending in a vial of your dogÉ??s DNA is far different from churning out 100000 identical cattle. That level of efficiency and speed is unprecedented and Xu hopes it will change the future of animal reproduction. The Chinese-born doctor with a PhD from Washington University and an MBA from Emory is part nerdy scientist part businessman with that rare combination of brains and street smarts. After working as a project manager at Pfizer he moved back to China where in 2009 he founded a massive stem-cell database with the help of seven research institutes. Three years later Xu founded Boyalife Group a $2 billion venture with four locations and 22 subsidiariesÉ??the newest is Boyalife Genomics. While acting as founder and CEO of Boyalife Xu is also an adjunct professor of molecular medicine at Peking University where heÉ??s heralded as an expert in everything from arthritis to oncology. Prior to the announcement of his new cloning factory the 44-year-old Xu had remained out of the global spotlight. But with the news that his Tianjin venture hopes to clone more mammals in a year than humanity has managed to clone in the previous 200000 his phone has started ringing off the hook. Cloning or asexual reproduction is a naturally occurring phenomenon in nature. A number of plants bacteria and single-celled organisms reproduce this way. Fungi for example split in two strawberries grow clones of themselves on their stems. Artificial cloning which XuÉ??s team will use to make cattle is decidedly more complicated. The science world recognizes three types of cloning: genetic therapeutic and reproductive. ItÉ??s the last one thatÉ??s used to clone whole animals through a process called nuclear transfer. To do this researchers replace the DNA from a new cell with that of an animal they intend to clone. Eventually the modified egg is placed inside an adult female who later gives birth to the clone. While researchers reportedly cloned frogs as early as the 1950s scientists werenÉ??t able to successfully clone a mammal until decades later. It was three scientists at the University of Edinburgh who achieved the feat with the birth of a cloned sheep in 1996É??the only one to succeed out of 277 attempts to live. The clone was named Dolly because it was made from the cell of a mammary gland and the researchers É??couldnÉ??t think of a more impressive pair than Dolly PartonÉ??s.É?ù In the next four years cloning as a science took off with researchers producing successful clones of a Rhesus monkey cow goat and more. Today a number of companies exist to clone animals with some focused on farm livestock like bulls and cows and others on an increasingly big business: family dogs. The largest of these companies Sooam Biotech has reportedly cloned 700 puppies since opening in 2004. The South Korean firm actually paired with Xu to create Boyalife Genomics but in an email to The Daily Beast declined to comment on the new venture. But if itÉ??s devotion to cloning dogs is any indication (É??[we] heal the broken heartsÉ?ù) it could play a big role in BoyalifeÉ??s future. Yet even as companies like Sooam grow in popularity anxiety has mounted around the idea of how far cloning could go. One of SooamÉ??s own researchers Hwang Woo-suk once alleged that he had cloned human embryos. The claim has since been struck down but the fear associated with it definitely has not. While the general public weighs the pros and cons of animal cloning the legal world is doing the same. In the U.S. cloning of farm animals is currently legalÉ??with the Federal Drug Administration declaring that these clones are as É??safe as the food we eat every day.É?ù The same is true in China but not everywhere. In August the European Union edged closer to outlawing the practice all together with the EU Parliament voting in favor of a sweeping cloning ban that would include farm animals. Meanwhile laws surrounding the cloning of humans remain murky. In the U.S. there is no federal law explicitly banning human clonesÉ??which is not to say that the practice is wholly legal. At least 15 states have passed legislation regarding human cloningÉ??eight of which prohibit it entirely. The UN General Assembly banned the practice in 2005 and the science world as a whole rejects it as unethical and unsafe. Leaders at The National Academy of Science have been petitioning for a worldwide ban on the practice since 2002 calling it É??dangerous and likely to fail.É?ù Among other outspoken organizations are the American Medical Association?ˇAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science and the FDA. During a 2002 congressional hearing on human cloning a researcher named Rudolf Jaenisch spelled out why he believed animal cloning was too dangerous to mimic in humans. Successful animal clones he said are preceded by many failed attempts. Those that make it are often plagued with health issues. Indeed reproductive cloning in animalsÉ??the same type that could in theory be used on humansÉ??comes with immense risk. The percentage of cloning efforts that succeed is generally between one and four percent. In the few clones that survivebiirth defects aboundÉ??ranging from brain deficiencies to drastically shortened life spans. And even though he plans to clone 1 million cows one day Xu like the majority of his scientific peers says he is gravely against the concept of human clones. É??No we donÉ??t do human cloning we wonÉ??t make FrankensteinsÉ?ù Xu told NBC. É??The technology we have is very advancedÉ??[but] every technology has to have a boundary.É?ù ,53565
